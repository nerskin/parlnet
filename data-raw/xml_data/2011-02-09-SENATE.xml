</talker>
<para>—The last time I spoke on the address-in-reply I was noting some of the changes that were made after the election. I was also talking about the South Australian result in the election. South Australia returned all House of Representative members with increased majorities, and a pleasing result it was indeed. Unfortunately, we have lost our third Senate spot, and that is Senator Dana Wortley. It is with great regret that we will lose Senator Wortley in due course.</para>
</talk.start>
<para>We in the Labor government worked very closely with the Labor government in South Australia. It certainly is a tough time to be in government and the South Australian Labor government suffered some small losses in their last election. But that has not deterred the South Australian government working together with the federal government in a forward-looking agenda. That has resulted in a strong economy in South Australia in sev-eral areas—in particular, in mining, defence and education—and in continuing the focus on manufacturing in South Australia. South Australia has suffered by being seen as an old manufacturing economy. What the federal and state governments have done is work towards making sure that that manufacturing moves into the new century in a strong position by using new technology, new techniques and finding niches in the export market so that manufacturing can continue to thrive in South Australia, albeit in an ever-changing form. I pay tribute to the Minister for Innovation, Industry, Science and Research, Senator Kim Carr, who as the responsible minister has put in place programs that have enabled manufacturing in South Australia to be strengthened and move forward.</para>
<para>In looking at the way South Australia has that strong forward-looking focus, while maintaining a strong economy, I want to pay tribute to Mr Kevin Foley, who has recently stepped down from the Treasury portfolio. He worked hard to deliver outcomes within a responsible economic framework and he imposed close discipline on the South Australian government while making money available for projects that would make sure South Australia moved forward into the future—for example, the mining exploration programs, the preparation work for defence manufacturing and the expansion of the education sector in South Australia. I worked with Kevin Foley when I was in opposition in the state parliament and I know how committed he is to responsible economic management and the future of South Australia. I wish him well in his new portfolios and I am very pleased that he has retained that key defence portfolio. It is certainly a very strong, although vulnerable, position in South Australia and I hope that we in South Australia can continue to work closely with the federal government.</para>
<para>On a national basis, Labor also suffered reversals in the last election and is now in a minority government, which of course adds many challenges to this parliament. Like the South Australian government, the federal Labor government is still committed to a reform agenda and will need to work very closely with all sides of politics to deliver that result, but that in itself is not a bad situation. It can be used, if used properly, to make sure that the checks and reviews are in place and that we can move forward with a strong consensus government. The Labor government can look on its record in the past government with some satisfaction. The government prevented Australia going into a recession during the global financial crisis. The initial short-term step was to boost consumer confidence through the $900 cash bonus, and that kept the economy boosted in that initial shock phase of the global financial crisis. The next step was to invest in medium-term infrastructure, which included the provision of new buildings and equipment in the education sector in particular. Now we are seeing the third phase, more the long-term phase, of building infrastructure for future productivity.</para>
<para>The measures that the Labor government put in place enabled the creation of jobs and kept many working families employed. In fact, in a 12-month period, the Labor government created 349,700 jobs, contributing towards a total of over 567,000 jobs having been created since Labor came to office in November 2007. This was very important, because it enabled skills retention. Now that we are looking at some kind of world recovery and at a recovery in Australia, we are seeing a skills shortage around the world. Governments around the world are facing this problem. We need to build up skills but we also need to make sure that we retain the skills that we have in our workforce. It is clear from past experience in recessions that skills loss happens rapidly, that once people are behind—once they are not in jobs or in education—they lose skills rapidly and find it very difficult to make up that deficit. So, quite apart from the knock-on effect to families and wider education, skills retention was very important. The business community must take some credit for that also, because it was well recognised that business, rather than retrench people, introduced flexible employment arrangements. They might have had to take away or reduce overtime or put people on part-time work, but they did, in general, try hard to retain their employees.</para>
<para>The stimulus package was not solely about stimulating the economy; it was also about nation building—for example, with the Building the Education Revolution, community infrastructure, social housing, and roads and rail. Labor also invested in vital infrastructure, such as health centres, many of which are in our regional areas. I went to Wudinna in South Australia to open the health centre, for which the government provided $400,000 via the Rural Medical Infrastructure Fund, money which would otherwise have had to be raised by the local community. Work on the building was predominantly completed by local tradespeople, which was a testament to the skills and ability available within that community. I have now opened many Building the Education Revolution projects in schools across South Australia. It was very good to witness the joy of our communities, principals and parents when first accessing the buildings. But the real joy was in seeing the young students and knowing the significance of these buildings to their education advancement and student experience.</para>
<para>Now we are embarking on another major infrastructure program: the National Broadband Network. This signifies a major investment in productivity driven infrastructure, an investment of up to $43 billion delivered to 93 per cent of premises, with speeds of 100 megabits per second, if not beyond. This benefits business, the health sector and the education sector but it also provides regional Australia with the ability to be brought forward into the 21st century technologically. For small business, this is particularly crucial, especially when many of them are currently paying a high amount of money for a service that does not sufficiently allow for efficient use or for a greater capacity for growth.</para>
<para>People, either through ignorance or a wilful misunderstanding, talk about the NBN as being useful only for faster downloading of movies or playing of games. That is patently not the case, and businesses around Australia know that that is not true. People who talk about it in those terms have almost zero understanding of the dynamics of small business in particular, regional businesses in particular and the opportunity that fast national broadband makes for productivity increases around Australia, particularly in regional areas. It is sad to me that people who are against the details of the NBN take this kind of argument against this type of technology—that they argue against the technology rather than the details. I could tolerate an argument against the details or against the expenditure but not against the kind of technology, because that indicates a head in the sand attitude to the need for the Australian economy to be driven forward, to be made more productive and to create more jobs in this area, much less the benefits it will create in providing health and education services, which, again, we need for further productivity down the track. I do not want Australia to be lagging behind in broadband compared to many of those forward-looking economies in the world that will easily overtake us if we allow ourselves to be held back in this area. So I am very pleased that the Gillard Labor government will be continuing to press ahead with this very much needed productivity infrastructure.</para>
<para>What the Labor government also brought to the reform agenda prior to the election was a decrease in the company tax rate from 30 per cent to 29 per cent. This is a small step but one which will also drive competitiveness and investment in Australia, starting us on a path to make Australia a more attractive opportunity for foreign direct investment as well as increased investment within Australia, with greater innovation and entrepreneurial activity. It will again drive productivity, as companies who have more capital will in turn be able to grow the economic pie.</para>
<para>This reform was underpinned by the proposed minerals resource rent tax—a fairer system, I think, to allow Australians to gain the right value on the resources that Australians own and that companies are exploiting. I have had a long association with the mining industry. I have strongly supported the mining industry and the way that they have returned some of their profits back into R&amp;D and back into the community, but there is no question that the terms of trade that they are experiencing are greatly on the increase, that they are more profitable and that they can pay more in taxation to assist our country to go ahead and to make productivity improvements, such as the NBN, such as reducing company tax and such as increasing our superannuation guarantee. It has been recognised widely—even by the opposition now, who opposed it in the beginning—that the superannuation guarantee levy has meant that Australia is in a good economic position despite the expected increase in the number of older people in our community over the next 20 or so years.</para>
<para>I want to return to the development of skills and training and the commitment of Labor governments to skills and training. It has been high on the agenda and it will continue to be high on the agenda for the Labor government. I would like to go back to my home state of South Australia and talk about the advantages for South Australians that this represents, because we do have increasing job possibilities in areas like manufacturing, defence, vehicle manufacturing and the mining industry. I would again like to commend the work of individuals in the South Australian Labor government—in this case, Premier Mike Rann and Minister Jack Snelling—who announced:</para>
<quote>
<para class="block">… a $125 million Sustainable Industries Education Centre to be built on the former Mitsubishi site at Tonsley Park by TAFE SA in collaboration with SA universities and industry.</para>
<para class="block">The new centre will specialise in training more than 8000 people a year in new green technologies associated with the building and construction industry—including plumbers, bricklayers, designers and carpenters.</para>
</quote>
<para class="block">This was a great initiative by the South Australian government. The minister at the time, Jack Snelling, has now become Treasurer and so I look forward to seeing that initiative given continued priority.</para>
<para>I have very little time left but I would just mention that the Labor government continues to devote a lot of resources and efforts to finding a solution for the River Murray. I expect that South Australia will get much more rigorous and efficient irrigation infrastructure in the scheme and look forward to the resolution of that longstanding issue in Australia.</para>
<para>Finally, I want to talk further about the proposed carbon tax and what we are going to do about the climate change debate. I was very pleased to hear the Minister for Climate Change and Energy Efficiency, Greg Combet, talk this morning on television in very practical terms about reducing pollution and making our industries more carbon efficient. I just want to mention a quote by James Fallows in the <inline font-style="italic">Atlantic</inline>, December 2010, in an article entitled ‘Dirty coal, clean future’. He said:</para>
<quote>
<para class="block">Overall, coal-burning power plants provide nearly half (about 46 percent this year) of the electricity consumed in the United States. For the record: natural gas supplies another 23 percent, nuclear power about 20 percent, hydroelectric power about 7 percent, and everything else the remaining 4 or 5 percent. The small size of the “everything else” total is worth noting; even if it doubles or triples, the solutions we often hear the most about won’t come close to meeting total demand. In China, coal-fired plants supply an even larger share of much faster-growing total electric demand: at least 70 percent …</para>
</quote>
<para class="block">In short, coal is here to stay. Although we will put a lot of effort into alternative power sources, we need to face the fact that we need baseload power. We need coal and we may well need nuclear power in the future. I think that, more and more, we should concentrate on how that is going to work—looking at not only other forms of renewable power but how coal and nuclear power are going to continue.</para>

</talker>
<para>—A lot has happened since the Governor-General delivered her speech, prepared by the government, a few short months ago. With no disrespect to the Governor-General, it was a speech that was more noted for what it did not say than for what it did say. In fact, I think most of us by now have really forgotten what the Governor-General’s speech indicated. I emphasise that is no disrespect to the Governor-General, but of course, as we all know, the Governor-General’s speech is written by the government of the day.</para>
</talk.start>
<para>In spite of dire warnings by Senator Wong, the Labor Party and the Greens about these climatic catastrophes that were about to befall the world and Australia, did the Governor-General say in her speech anything about putting money aside for those expected catastrophes? The Rudd government came into power with a $20 billion asset in the form of savings the Howard government had made. Elsewhere there was $60 billion put aside. All of that $60 billion has been wasted in two short years by a government that is addicted to spending and taxing. As a result of that, when we have these calamities that are very normal in Australia and for which governments must expect to have to pick up the bill every year, we find ourselves with the coffers bare and the government, the Labor Party and Ms Gillard again talking in the only way they know about a supposed solution for these issues—and that is to impose another tax on the already overtaxed Australian public.</para>
<para>Her Excellency, in her speech, made no reference whatsoever to the failures of this government’s predecessors or to the lack of any mandate that this present government has for any program. This government in its previous iteration was well categorised as a government that was all spin and no action. It was a government that had been elected three years previously with a lot of goodwill, goodwill that had been dissipated by the brutal removal of an elected prime minister by a group of faceless men who control the Labor Party in this country. Mark my words, Madam Acting Deputy President: the same thing will happen to the current Prime Minister. You can see already that the Rudd loyalists, as Mr Toohey in his very perceptive article in the weekend paper noted, are out there campaigning to get rid of Ms Gillard. In spite of the fact that Ms Gillard has clearly watched closely the performance of the Queensland Premier in times of tragedy, nothing will save Ms Gillard from the faceless men who control the Labor Party. You see around the hall the Rudd loyalists, the anti-Gillard people, already gathering. It will not be long. Senator Arbib had better watch out, because he was one of the leaders of the push to get rid of Mr Rudd and install Ms Gillard. He must now be regretting very heavily that action.</para>
<para>Labor’s huge majority in the previous parliament was completely destroyed. There were huge swings away from Labor to the coalition in the resource rich states of Western Australia and Queensland, and we saw the unedifying spectacle after the election of the Prime Minister, who had assumed office by the most deceitful and vicious action against her former leader, clinging to power by offering whatever it took to the Greens and the Independents. Cling to power the Labor Party did, by its fingernails. In the end, it became clear that the government had no program, no mandate, no authority and no vision. It did, however, have a very clear determination to cling to power because, in the end, for the Labor Party, power is what it is all about. The election campaign was full of promises by the Labor Party which it never intended to keep. The sort of duplicity that would have done credit to the former socialist governments of eastern Europe was replicated by the Labor Party in the election campaign. But, as bad as the Labor Party was during the election campaign, that negativity paled into insignificance against the dishonest and deceitful campaign by the Australian Greens.</para>
<para>The Labor Party’s campaign was full of mistruths and downright lies about the mining tax, the carbon tax and detention centres, for example. During the course of the campaign, we were told there would be no carbon tax. In fact, Ms Gillard promised the Australian public, the less than 50 per cent who voted for her, that she would not bring in a carbon tax—and they voted for her on that basis. Of course, as soon as she was in power, what was the first thing she did? She indicated that a carbon tax would be introduced. She said that a deal on the mining tax had been struck with the mining companies. We know that that announcement by Ms Gillard was also a downright mistruth: there had been no deal struck with the mining companies and that has become obvious now. We were told there would be no new detention centres. When the issue of a possible detention centre in Cape York at RAAF Base Scherger was mentioned it was denied by the Labor Party and its functionaries. We now know only too well how untrue that denial was.</para>
<para>The deceit and duplicity of the Labor Party in the national campaign was mirrored in the campaigns run by the Labor Party at local level. In the electorate of Dawson, up my way, we were told that the sitting member had retired from ill-health, but everyone knew that the real story was that he had been forced to retire by the faceless men of the Labor Party in favour of their selected candidate, the Mayor of Bowen—interestingly referred to locally as Moscow Mike. We know in the Townsville based seat of Herbert the wishes of the local Labor Party branch members were completely ignored when the national executive, the then Prime Minister Kevin Rudd and Julia Gillard, selected disgraced former Mayor of Townsville, Tony Mooney, as the candidate for what the party believed would be the easiest of electorates to win. In fact, it had become a notional Labor Party electorate following the re-distribution and it was ripe for picking by the faceless men of the Labor Party. As the Labor Party do, they buy, sell, trade and will these seats to their mates, friends and families.</para>
<para>In the case of Herbert the local Labor people were absolutely shattered. This had the impact of local Labor Party branch members not supporting the campaign, which resulted in the head office having to pay people to man polling booths in the electorate of Herbert. I will just repeat that: the Labor Party national campaign had to pay people to campaign in the electorate of Herbert. Indeed, in one of the most extraordinarily deceitful aspects of the campaign, the Labor Party in Herbert handed out a deceptive counterfeit how-to-vote card indicating that those wishing to vote Green should follow this counterfeit how-to-vote card, which appeared to be a Green how-to-vote card, giving the Labor Party second preference. So incensed were the local Green activists, who had made a deliberate decision in Herbert not to preference any party and not to hand out how-to-vote cards on polling day, they were running around the polling booths telling people who had received the fake Green cards that these cards were not Green how-to-vote cards but in fact bogus Labor cards.</para>
<para>I questioned some of the young people who were handing out fake Green how-to-vote cards at the booths, and so did colleagues of mine. There were some funny stories about them, I have to tell you, but it became clear from what I was told by these young people that they had answered an internet advertisement offering them a job at $25 an hour to hand out how-to-vote cards. Most of them told me they believed they were handing them out for the Greens political party and they were surprised when I showed them that the cards were actually authorised and produced by the Labor Party.</para>
<para>It was quite funny. A couple of the young people I saw giving out those cards were actually saying to the people they handed them out to, ‘Here is a how-to-vote card but we’re voting for Ewen Jones, the LNP candidate, and we urge you to do the same.’ Some of the people handing out how-to-vote cards did not even vote on election day, because they were New Zealanders looking for some cash during their backpacking tour around Australia. But can you believe it, Madam Acting Deputy President—the once great Labor Party having to pay people $25 an hour to hand out fake how-to-vote cards and to man their own booths? It was because Labor stalwarts in Townsville were so incensed at the faceless men who had destroyed their choice as the candidate and put in Tony Mooney. Of course, in both Dawson and Herbert we know the results of the Labor Party national executive putting in their favoured candidates. Both seats were won very comfortably by the LNP, and all credit to Ewen Jones and George Christensen.</para>
<para>Prior to the election, all the electorates north of the Tropic of Capricorn, numbering nine in all, were held by the Labor Party or Independents. When the dust settled after the election, the Labor Party had lost all but two seats in Northern Australia, and in Capricornia, for example, it had suffered an eight per cent swing against it. The result in Northern Australia was certainly a singing endorsement of the leadership of Tony Abbott, the policies of the Liberal and National parties and the organisational skill of the Liberal Party in Western Australia, the CLP in the Northern Territory and the LNP in Queensland.</para>
<para>The Governor-General’s speech talked about parliamentary reform. We know what the Labor Party think of democracy and parliamentary reform. Senator Cameron made it quite clear in his now well-publicised comment that Labor Party parliamentarians were just like zombies and had no say whatsoever. No-one knows why the people of Australia voted for individual candidates, because, according to Senator Cameron, all they do is act like zombies, sit there and get told what to do—although I expect the zombies will be rising, Senator Hutchins, looking at Ms Gillard and yearning for the days when Mr Rudd was leader. Let us hope Mr Rudd gets back as leader. I would look forward to the challenge of him being in charge again, but I guess it is six of one and half-a-dozen of the other.</para>
<para>The Governor-General spoke about a stronger economy. I have mentioned that the $60 billion the coalition had put aside in credit was frittered away in two short years by this government addicted to spending. Now, after the government promising no carbon tax, we are going to have a carbon tax. After the government saying the mining tax had been fixed, we are going to have a new mining tax. And now we are going to a new tax to do the sorts of things that governments are expected to do—that is, look after infrastructure and look after Australians who have suffered from calamities.</para>
<para>The Governor-General also made reference to climate change and sustainability. I still cannot understand how Senator Wong, Ms Gillard and the Labor Party can go around saying that Australia has to lead in reducing carbon emissions. Australia produces less than 1.2 per cent of the world’s output of greenhouse gases. The Labor Party want to break Australian industry and Australian workers so that they can go to the world stage and say, ‘We’re leading the charge.’ If all of the programs that even the Greens have put forward were adopted, the impact on global output of greenhouse gas would be absolutely infinitesimal. I have always said that, when the rest of the world does it, so should Australia, but to try and lead in this area will just destroy our economy and the jobs of workers, which the Labor Party pretend they look after.</para>
<para>On regional Australia, the Governor-General’s speech contained a couple of half-columns. The only person the government could find to be appointed to the regional portfolio was a bloke who represents an inner city Melbourne seat. Mr Crean is a nice guy, and to become the ACTU boss and then fight his way through the Labor machine to get elected to parliament, he clearly has got some things going for him. But stuck down in one of our biggest cities, in the centre of Melbourne, is the guy that looks after regional Australia. I suppose it is better than the Rudd government, which had two ministers, one sitting each side of Sydney’s Kingsford Smith Airport, doing the portfolio work for regional Australia. The government pay lip-service to regional Australia. I am the shadow parliamentary secretary for northern and remote Australia. I am not quite sure who I am shadowing at the moment, because after the election and the very poor result that the Labor Party had in Northern Australia, they have completely dropped the title. They have dropped any interest they ever feigned in Northern Australia, and it will be left to the coalition to give proper recognition to the wealth, the energy and the enthusiasm that Northern Australia brings to our nation.</para>
<para>I want to make some comment about the Greens political party. Their members are more interested in outdated and discredited socialist policies more reminiscent of eastern Europe in the fifties and sixties than a modern democracy of today. The absolute stupidity of those comments by the Greens leaders on Australian coal companies being the cause of the floods and cyclones is just beyond comment. That is the sort of group that keeps this government in power. That is the sort of group that will direct the Labor Party, who are only interested in power, and will direct the policies—those left-wing, socialist, eastern European policies of the fifties and sixties. That is what this government has to rely on to stay in office. Stay in office it will, and that means it will roll over to the Greens.</para>
<para>I will seek leave at the end of my speech to table a list of climatic conditions which is going around the internet. I have had my staff check them with reliable sources. As best as we can tell, most of the conditions are accurately portrayed. It shows that cyclones, floods, droughts, storms and other weather calamities have been happening since European man first recorded these things in Australia. Practically every year since 1864 there have been major climatic events. As far as I am aware, Senator Bob Brown, the Australian coal companies were not pumping out greenhouse gases back in 1864 and in practically every year since. I raise this only to show up the sort of stupid comment—an absolutely gormless comment—made by the leader of the Australian Greens. This is the party that the Labor Party relies on to cling to government, and that is a disgrace. There will, I am sure, be more said about that over the next months. Senator Brown will no doubt be trying to wiggle out of his comments, but he and his colleagues are absolutely ridiculous on these sorts of things.</para>
<para>I will conclude as I started, having said that things have changed quite a bit since the Governor-General made her speech. I think yesterday most of us in this chamber indicated our empathy, our distress, our support and our condolences for those who have suffered as a result of the natural calamities that Australia expects and that we have had over many years. It is on a sombre note that the parliament starts this week. It is of regret to me, however, that this government is so incompetent that it has not put aside or at least saved some of the money the previous government allocated for the work that we all know will have to be done every year as a result of natural calamities. I urge the Senate to support Senator Abetz’s very perceptive amendment to this motion and urge that the motion be adopted.</para>

<para>—Senator Macdonald said a number of things in his contribution in this address-in-reply debate that I take issue with. One thing, of course, with which I would not take issue is his description of the Greens. While the major parties are often accused of being opportunistic and cynical, those of us who have observed the Greens in action here in the Senate and publicly, particularly in New South Wales, would have to say that the Greens are high up in both of those categories. Another point I want to make is the cynicism and the absolute political opportunism of the Green parties, but not at this stage because I do want to make sure that I do not miss them one bit. The one thing that I think we should remind Australians about is the day that Senator Hanson-Young brought her child in here, which caused a kerfuffle. You may recall that, Madam Acting Deputy President, because it was the same day, as I recall, that the Greens were being asked to explain a half-million-dollar donation—I think it was in cash—that they were having difficulty explaining. But only the major political parties get accused of being cynical, not the white knights in the Greens.</para>
</talk.start>
<para>Senator Macdonald also talked about our Minister for Regional Australia, Regional Development and Local Government, Simon Crean. Senator Macdonald has been around a long time. He would recall that in the dying days of the Gorton government Billy McMahon was made Minister for Primary Industry. Billy McMahon was a member for an area around Sydney that covered Strathfield, Homebush, a bit of Ashfield and other places that I cannot recall at the moment. Prime Minister McMahon did not live in his electorate when he was a minister. He lived in the eastern suburbs of Sydney. He would have been an elector of Malcolm Turnbull. So it is not without precedent that we have had people who have lived in the inner city. Your party, Senator Macdonald, set the precedent by making Billy McMahon the Minister for Primary Industry.</para>

<para>In this address-in-reply I want to talk about a few things. The first is the last election. It must be galling to you, Madam Acting Deputy President Boyce, and members of the Liberal Party that your leader from New South Wales, Tony Abbott, a member of the New South Wales division, as you call it, performed so poorly in the last federal election. Labor lost one seat. We lost one person who was holding that seat, Maxine McKew. Some might say that is not a bad thing; I will not comment. We also did not pick up a seat that we had held, which was Macquarie. But there were seats that the coalition could have, should have and would have picked up if their New South Wales division and Tony Abbott, being one of the leaders of that division, had performed much better. In the seat of Macquarie there was Louise Markus, whose campaign in 2004 in Greenway was marked by racist and anti-religious comments by people who were against our candidate, a fellow called Eddie Husic, by background a Bosnian Muslim. He was subjected to a lot of racist and anti-religious mail, anonymous of course.</para>
<para>Louise Markus had won the seat of Greenway and when the redistribution occurred after the last election Mrs Markus decided to run for Macquarie. The Liberals endorsed in Greenway a young fellow who had very little connection with the area, who was not known and who was in fact more seen by the people in that area as a puppet of his father. He was selected as the Liberal candidate. If I recall, and maybe my coalition colleagues will correct me when they have an opportunity to make a contribution, we won that seat by a handful of votes. If you were a Liberal from other states, you might wonder why the Liberals did not ask Louise Markus to stay and contest Greenway. You might ask that. It was intriguing to us in the Labor Party that someone who had been the member for that area for nearly six years was so gutless that she moved on to another seat, which she won narrowly, but we won Greenway narrowly.</para>
<para>Then you go to Tony Abbott’s favourite seat, Lindsay, where the Liberal candidate was selected I think six weeks before the federal election. I am being generous here—I think it was four weeks but let us say it was six. Fiona Scott, whose family is involved in business in the area, I understand won the preselection from the Liberal Party preselectors because she said she would spend a quarter of a million dollars of her own money in winning the seat. As soon as Ms Scott became the candidate, they could not wheel her out anywhere because Ms Scott had not been trained to be a candidate. She had not been prepared for the job that she was going to do. The lady who was defeated in the preselection was in Toastmasters, was a very articulate woman and probably would have given us a run for our money. I know I speak on behalf of not only the New South Wales Labor Party but the government when I say I am grateful that the New South Wales Liberal division endorsed Fiona Scott, because we might not have held that seat. Lindsay was one of Tony Abbott’s signature seats. In fact, on election day he had his daughters handing out cards there and he spent a lot of time out there during the campaign. As you may recall, Madam Acting Deputy President, so did the Prime Minister. We won that seat. We had a swing against us but we retained the seat with a one per cent margin due to the great work of the sitting member, David Bradbury.</para>
<para>I notice there are no New South Wales Liberals in here today but that there is a National Party senator. They did deliver for the coalition in the bush, unfortunately for us.</para>

<para>—I am talking about New South Wales Liberals, Senator Mason. Then you go ahead and you have a choice between three New South Wales Liberals to run your party. Crikey. You have Mr Abbott, Mr Hockey and Mr Turnbull, all of them out of the New South Wales division, where you only picked up one seat overall in the federal election, the seat of Macquarie, which was not contested by a sitting member. How is it that you can go back to your party room and look at any of these New South Wales Liberals and expect them to deliver for you? Tony Abbott had his fingerprints all over the Lindsay preselection and in the end you could not win that seat with all that we had at the time going against us. I am very grateful to the New South Wales division of the Liberal Party. It is important that they be recognised for their contribution to the federal Labor government. It may be that we should strike a coin or a medal to Tony Abbott and the New South Wales Liberals. And if you saw or listened to the debate between Barry O’Farrell and Kristina Keneally the other day you would think that they are at it again. They do not know what they are about to do and all they are doing is being against. I am concerned that we might see a Liberal government in New South Wales and we do not know what they would do.</para>

<para>In the time left to me I wanted to speak about the people who advocate the decriminalisation of drugs. I do not think I am going to have the opportunity to make the contribution that I want to at the moment and I will have to leave that for another time.</para>

<para>—I understand that, but what I need to say is going to take longer than eight minutes and 47 seconds. I feel passionate about the issue of people who advocate the decriminalisation of drugs. We have seen an instance of that very publicly in New South Wales in the last few weeks where again the Greens have immediately jumped on the bandwagon and said they should be decriminalised.</para>
</talk.start>
</continue>
<para>In the few minutes I have left I want to talk about two things. The first is that I want to compliment the retiring chief executive of the Australian Rail Track Corporation, David Marchant. I am not sure how many years David has been the chief executive of the Australian Rail Track Corporation but in that time thousands of kilometres of rail lines have been changed from having timber sleepers to having concrete sleepers. That does not get a tick in terms of how sexy things are in the national economy, but it has meant that trains have been able to travel the 50 or 60 kilometres and not worry about the heat as they previously had to. That has contributed magnificently to the economy of this country. This program was started under the Howard government and has been continued by Labor. David has now retired from that position. I am not sure what he is going to do, and I forget the name of the chap who is taking over. I think that we should acknowledge grand public servants of the nation who have made such a significant contribution. I am sure my colleague Senator Williams, affectionately known as ‘Wacka’, would have seen the amount of rail track that has been replaced with concrete sleepers and the impact that it has had on the economy of our state. So I want to make sure that in my contribution today Mr Marchant is suitably recognised for his contribution.</para>
<para>Finally, I want to compliment a young lady who made her maiden speech in the Victorian parliament last night—my wife. I was listening to Natalie Hutchins make her contribution to parliament, and in fact I voted in the national executive of the Labor Party for Natalie to be the candidate for Keilor. At a pub named Taylors Lakes Hotel, which is not far from where Nat lives and where I will also be living shortly—it is one of the few places in Victoria where you can get a schooner, and Steve, Ann and Jessie look after us there—Nat has been affectionately christened by the locals as ‘the sheila from Keilor’. In her contribution last night she made a very considered and passionate speech on behalf of her electorate of Keilor. I think it is important that we acknowledge the contribution of activists. My wife is a former union official and a former small business woman and she is now a member of the Victorian parliament. She is very dedicated to her electorate and she of course mentioned her husband in her maiden speech, which I thought was very important! One of the interesting things is that my wife decided to run under her married name, Hutchins, rather than under her maiden name, which was Sykes. The reason for that is that her brother said to her, ‘What would you rather be known as, ‘Hutcho’ or ‘Syko’? So she chose the former.</para>
<para>I have a significant contribution to make on opposition to the legalisation of drugs and I will have to do that at another time. But I do want to just reiterate in my final comments that we in the Labor Party do owe a great deal of debt to the New South Wales division of the Liberals. Without their assistance, we probably would not be in power today. Without Louise Markus running away from Greenway and running in Macquarie, we probably would not have won Greenway. Without their poor selection of candidates in Lindsay, we possibly would not have held Lindsay. So it is left to me, a former president of the New South Wales branch of the Labor Party, to make sure that the New South Wales division of the Liberal Party is suitably acknowledged for their woeful efforts in the last campaign. Look at the magnificent contribution that you, Senator Mason, and you, Madam Acting Deputy President Boyce, must feel that you made as Queens-landers to the coalition effort, and then look at the contribution of New South Wales Liberals. Again, all you have got is three New South Welshmen to choose from, and, again, Tony Abbott does run the New South Wales division. So once more on behalf of a grateful Labor government we thank the New South Wales division of the Liberals for their magnificent effort in making sure that we are on this side of the chamber and you are on that side.</para>

</talk.start>
<quote>
<para class="block">… education lies at the heart of the government’s agenda to strengthen workforce participation and enhance our nation’s fairness and prosperity.</para>
</quote>
<para class="block">Putting aside for a second the fact that what was supposed to be at the heart of the Labor Party’s agenda was in fact forgotten in the naming of their ministry following the last election, this concentration on education—the so-called education revolution—echos what Mr Blair and New Labour were doing 15 years ago and, indeed, there are echos going back to President Johnson and the ‘Great Society’ in the 1960s. It is quite common in the social democratic project to have education at the core.</para>
<para>The question really is: how has the government gone over the last three years with its—to use its words—‘core project’? How has the government performed? Senators might remember it all started with Mr Rudd and the laptop computers. Do you remember that, Mr Acting Deputy President? He stood up one day—it looked great on television—and said, holding a laptop computer, ‘This is the toolbox of the 21st century.’ It was great TV graphics. He said there would be a computer for every student from year 9 to year 12. He sort of said that, but then he spoke about access to a computer. Indeed, we wondered what the promise meant. But in the end, the government came to the party and said, ‘All right, we’ll provide a million computers so that every student gets one.’ There is a ratio of one to one—one computer for every student. What happened on this first part of the core project? The Commonwealth underbudgeted by about $2 billion. Far worse than that, it was only talking about the capital cost of the hardware—the computers. What about the installation, the maintenance, the insurance, the licensing and the software; who is going to pay for that? Guess who had to pay? State governments, private schools and parents ended up paying billions because the federal government had not thought about that—it did not look cool on TV—and in fact it cost four times as much as the hardware. For every dollar you spend on hardware, you need to spend about another $4 on other costs. So state governments, nongovernment schools and parents had to come up with somewhere between $2 billion and $4 billion to cover the so-called ‘laptop computer oncosts’. This was right at the start of the Building the Education Revolution.</para>
<para>How is the implementation going? As of last October 2010—the last estimates—out of one million computers promised, how many had been delivered? Only 345,000. I can accurately say, 34.5 per cent, about one-third, had actually been delivered. At this rate of delivery, even on the government’s own figures—and laptop computers become redundant after four years—given only one-third have been delivered after three, they will become redundant before they are delivered. This is a fiasco. It has received a lot of airplay but this was, in a sense, a principal commitment in the core objective of this government.</para>
<para>The other important aspect of laptop computers was not just the provision and delivery of them, it was also the internet connection. The other part of the promise that Mr Rudd made was to connect all laptop computers to fibre internet with speeds of up to 100 megabytes a second. Remember, that was the promise from 2007. So let me ask: how many laptop computers have been connected by the Commonwealth to fibre? Pick any number between zero and one million. The answer is none—zero, or as Mr Rudd would have said, zip. None has been connected by the Commonwealth government to 100 megabytes per second broadband, not one. But I am told at every estimates meeting not to worry. ‘Don’t worry, Senator Mason, because Senator Conroy has it under control. When the NBN gets going everything will be OK and all the computers’—even if they are redundant—‘will be attached to fast-speed broadband.’ By the time the NBN rolls out, the students who are promised fast fibre connection will be as old as me. It has taken a long, long time.</para>
<para>You know how generous I am—very generous. In my former life as a university lecturer, I commonly gave out marks to students and I was always very generous and well known to be generous. So I will give a scorecard on the first part of the education revolution. In terms of the laptops I have decided, after a lot of reflection, to give the government a fail mark—sorry, and that is being generous.</para>
<para>The next part of the education revolution was building school halls. Part of this was to provide stimulus to the economy, to answer the global financial crisis, and also because apparently new school halls meant better educational outcomes. We have never heard much about new school halls leading to better educational outcomes. That link has never been made conclusively. Putting that aside for the moment—as you know I am generous—we know that the building school halls project cost about $16 billion. It is the largest infrastructure project in our history.</para>
<para>The question really is: how could you spend $16 billion and have so many people unhappy? How could a government do that? There are several reasons. The first one is the lack of flexibility. These infamous design templates, which have a whiff of central planning, which I know my friend Senator Carr loves—the whiff of Stalinism; this soviet-era planning that he loves. Schools that wanted gymnasiums got libraries and schools that wanted libraries got gymnasiums. It was a shambles. The templates did not work.</para>
<para>Far more fundamentally, as the Commonwealth Auditor-General said, the problem with the entire project was this: the Commonwealth government did not have the technical expertise to adequately oversight state expenditure of Commonwealth money on schools. That is the heart of the problem—the Commonwealth government did not know whether they were getting good value for money or not. That, in a sentence, is the problem with the entire school halls project.</para>

<para>—Let me get to Mr Orgill in a minute. That, fundamentally, is the problem—the government did not have the requisite nous, the requisite flexibility or the requisite expertise to ensure that Commonwealth taxpayers’ money was being well spent by state governments. The Auditor-General has said that. This has implications right across so-called cooperative federalism. It has enormous implications, not just in education but in health and elsewhere. This is an enormous administrative failure.</para>
</talk.start>
</continue>
<para>Let us look at the cost of school buildings built by state governments compared with nongovernment schools. We now know that costs have been inflated by price gouging and mismanagement, and that of course has cost billions. The building program is way behind, particularly in Victoria. We were told we had to wait because the market was overheating in Victoria, and now of course it has become inflationary. I always thought that stimulus projects were supposed to be timely, targeted and temporary. Remember that? That was the original test set by the government. Again, even on their own terms, they have failed.</para>
<para>The government dragged out poor old Mr Orgill, and what did he find in his first report? On page 22, schematic 4, we find that New South Wales government school projects cost $3,477 per square metre. For New South Wales Catholic schools the cost was $2,724 per square metre, and for New South Wales independent schools the cost was $2,148. The cost in New South Wales government schools is more than 60 per cent more per square metre than in New South Wales nongovernment schools. The independent schools are more than $1,300 a square metre cheaper. There is the same pattern in Victoria—government schools $2,850 per square metre; independent schools $1,841. That is a difference of $1,009 per square metre. In Queensland, government schools cost $2,743 per square metre; independent schools $1,736—a difference of $1,007 per square metre. The government is building schools in both Queensland and Victoria that are 50 per cent more expensive per square metre than independent schools, and more than 60 per cent more expensive than independent schools in New South Wales. That is a disgrace.</para>
<para>Mr Orgill, in his own report, said it was not just about cost per square metre; it was about quality and timeliness. Even though the New South Wales government and some of its bureaucrats tried to say that the quality in the Catholic and independent schools was not as good, Mr Orgill found that the quality across all sectors was very similar—the same. So quality is not a relevant differentiating factor. The only factor is time. It is true that in New South Wales the average state government project took 500 days to build while in the independent sector it took 600 days. It took 20 per cent more time to build independent school projects—about 100 days more, or three months—but cost 60 per cent more. In Victoria, the government school projects cost 50 per cent more than in independent schools and they were slower to build than in the independent sector. In Queensland, the independent school projects were completed faster and were much cheaper to build. So timeliness does not even get Mr Orgill and the government off the hook.</para>
<para>The bottom line for about 70 per cent of the schools in Australia—the government schools in New South Wales, Victoria and Queensland—is absolutely disgraceful. How much did it cost? If those government school projects had been delivered at the cost delivered for independent schools, we would have saved the taxpayer, the community, about $2.6 billion. If they had been built at the same cost as Catholic school projects, the savings would have been about $1.8 million. I understand we are about to have a flood levy, and it is hoped to raise about $1.8 billion. If the government had secured the value for money that the Catholic and independent schools received from their school hall projects, there would be no need for this levy. The government did not have the oversight mechanisms in place to ensure that state governments secured value for money for their building projects, and that is an absolute disgrace. They knew about it, they were told about it, they were warned about it, but what did they do? Nothing. And, now we have spent about 75 per cent of the money, it is too late to secure value for money for these projects. It is an absolute and utter disgrace.</para>
<para>The other day poor old Mr Orgill had to fend me off in a committee meeting. He was uncomfortable, and I do not blame him—it is not his fault. It is the government’s fault, not Mr Orgill’s. I may have given the government a conceded pass on the building school halls program, but I have lost my generosity when I think that this crowd is about to impose a flood levy on the people of Australia that would not have been necessary if they had secured value for money for state school projects. They do not deserve any generosity in any way at all. All I can do is give the government a big F for fail there as well. It is absolutely disgraceful. It is perhaps the great-est financial mismanagement in the post-war era—and that is saying a lot. It has cost this country billions.</para>
<para>Let me go to the national curriculum—and I wish I had 50 minutes to speak and not just 20. Education is supposed to be the Prime Minister’s strong point, but everything she touches turns to sand. The national curriculum is not a bad idea. The government did well initiating it, and I accept that. It is a good idea because it can raise standards. It can mean world’s best practice. It can mean international benchmarking. I am not against the principle. But what has happened? It has been hijacked by the ideologues, and we have these overarching themes: Asia, sustainability and indigeneity. They are the three overarching themes in our national curriculum. Mr Acting Deputy President Hutchins, you might ask why we don’t have an overarching theme about the importance of liberal democratic institutions. I would have thought that was an important overarching theme. What about the impact of Judaeo-Christian ethics on our life here in Australia? I would have thought that was an important overarching theme. What about the role of science and technology in the material progress of mankind? I would have thought that was an important overarching theme, but apparently not as important as Asia or sustainability or indigeneity. It shows just how out of touch I am, obviously, to possibly believe that the importance of liberal democratic institutions might trump even that. How wrong I am.</para>
<para>The trendies have got involved and the ideologues have got involved, and what has happened? Support for the national curriculum has started to fall. Some states now do not want to introduce it. I know that New South Wales always thought that they had the best system. People like former Premier Bob Carr, who was very strong on education, are concerned that the national curriculum will mean lower standards in New South Wales. I was going to give a pass mark on the national curriculum, but I am not sure I can. I am not sure we should be adopting it. Mr Pyne certainly is not sure we should be adopting it. It seems it is not a good idea—certainly based on its implementation.</para>
<para>The government talks about vocational education and training. Remember the trade training centres? Remember all that? They promised one for each school. With 2,700 schools, there should be 2,700 trade training centres—potentially with some clusters. After three years, how many are up and running? Does anyone want to have a guess? Of the 2,700 that were supposed to be created, how many trade training centres are up and running? After three years, 48 are up and running. We were promised 2,700—another implementation process in shambles. That is the problem.</para>

<para>—Oh, yes, it is an absolute shambles. We have 48 out of 2,700. I do not have time to touch on higher education, but in conclusion let me say this: laptops were a failure in the cost of implementation and internet connection. The Orgill report highlights the gross failure and outright gouging of expenditure in state schools that is costing this country literally billions of dollars. In vocational education and training, 48 out of 2,700 schools have one of those trade training centres. This government has failed in what is supposed to be its core business.</para>

<para>—In this address-in-reply, I want to respond to those matters in the Governor-General’s speech dealing with defence policy. In particular, I want to reflect on a number of matters relating to defence procurement in Australia, following the lengthy visit I made to the United States late last year. The Senate would be aware of my longstanding interest in defence policy matters, in particular the management of procurement. There are many relevant reasons for the importance of US defence procurement policy for Australia. Firstly, of course, the United States has long been a key source of defence materiel for the ADF and it is important that we keep abreast of new technology. Within the alliance there are matters of shared long-term strategies. There is also a growing degree of interoperability and a growing interdependence of our own defence industries. We do need to be sensitive to the changes affecting United States industry not only strategically because of the direct flow-ons for the cost of purchases we might make but also because of the direct implications that they may have for our domestic defence industries where we need continuity and an assurance of skill retention and supply capability. The importance of this knowledge of the health of US defence industries cannot be overstated, especially in a rapidly changing international economic and military climate. It is important that we understand these applications and their context.</para>
</talk.start>
<para>In response to the global financial crisis, we are now seeing dramatic reductions in defence budgets in those countries with high levels of sovereign debt—for example, countries such as the United Kingdom and France, whose public debt levels are such that their entire financial security is under threat. Public expenditure on defence procurement throughout Europe has also been slashed. The demand for defence items has accordingly reduced sharply. Defence industries will immediately feel the brunt. Defence capability will be reduced significantly and no doubt over time R&amp;D will also decline. No doubt cooperation with the EU on defence capability might be accelerated, and the discussion between the United Kingdom and France on shared naval resources is a case in point. Hence, the United States is important. Equally, there is a huge amount of pressure for budgetary cuts for much the same reasons—not to mention the realisation that defence and all other public expenditure such as state grants and federal programs can no longer be financed so heavily from debt. That debt, as we know, was generated by two phases of the global financial crisis driven by the collapse of the subprime market. As well as that, we have the massive indebtedness to China through China’s trade surplus, principally with the United States, now being corrected by a reduction in the value of the US dollar.</para>
<para>Yet there are other circumstances in the US defence procurement environment which are different and these circumstances directly affect the state of the industry. The key element is simply the dramatic nature of the US military budget, which—notwithstanding the growth since the days of the Reagan presidency—has grown in real terms by 79 per cent since 9/11. In fact, 21 per cent of the current budget is spent on overseas deployments; therefore, the growth in demand for military hardware production over the last decade has been huge. It should be noted that this growth followed a long-term decline after the Cold War, which for a period saw capability reduced; however, during that period no other industry efficiencies were sought by government.</para>
<para>It was said to me by both industry and government representatives that opportunities in that period to restructure, close redundant bases, innovate and invest were not taken. Competitive discipline suffered as the emphasis was placed on production on a cost-plus—but not on a competitive—basis. Companies, through large production runs of increasing unit costs, accumulated large cash surpluses which were not returned to shareholders or invested. Productivity and R&amp;D dropped away as sustainment was the driving force—not efficiency and certainly not cost. Importantly, a huge level of skill was also lost, especially from government, which was driven mostly by outsourcing.</para>
<para>No doubt as part of that obsessive concern with the size of government in the US, Defense lost enormous numbers of people specialising in contract tendering and project management. Lack of salary, flexibility and wage restrictions within government were also limiting factors, I was told. Companies, though, maintained their levels of expertise, with the disparity then perhaps creating unevenness between the two negotiating parties. So complaints familiar to us in Australia began to emerge.</para>
<para>The United States government had no idea of how industry worked, communication was poor and tender specifications were inadequate. The symptoms were the same as they were in Australia: namely, tenders were regularly priced low and then increased as time passed under the cost-plus principle; budgetary evils such as spending limited to a financial year; limitation encouraged hollow logging and unmerited advances of payment; tender processes were cut short for reasons of expediency; product was poor and delivery times blew out significantly; there was lack of coordination across the three services; tender specifications were not met; and needless to say, costs just continued to go through the roof.</para>
<para>There was too much emphasis on partnership with industry, rather than on an objective, arm’s length relationship. There was constant pressure at the outset to underestimate costs to facilitate decisions, with costs not included and risks not evaluated or priced. There was poor articulation of the policy and the military strategies that supported purchasing. Supplementary funding was easy to acquire, especially where there was high constituency value in a particular contract. Prescribed processes were ignored. Payments were made on progress of process, not outcomes, and there was a chronic lack of knowledge or understanding of systems integration.</para>
<para>However, it must be said that the worm seems to have turned—or to at least be in the process of turning. Now, with some reduction in demand following the withdrawal from Iraq and faced with budget reductions, the US industry faces a double whammy, firstly, because demand is reduced post Iraq, and secondly, because efficiencies and productivity, which should have been achieved earlier, are now being demanded by government. In fact, action akin to that taken in Australia over the last decades following the reports of Kinnaird and Mortimer is now becoming the norm. The political climate is now demanding tax concessions and smaller government.</para>
<para>In the face of the need for added revenue and government investment, something has to give and US Defense is being directed to take a disproportionate share of that pain. Secretary Gates has been blunt about what the administration expects. Not only have programs for the production of aircraft and the naval fleet been cut but processes are being reformed. For example, plans are afoot to restore the level of procurement skill in Defense previously lost, and I was told this could mean the hiring of an additional 20,000 people. New competitive tendering processes are being put in place. It is important to note that the restrictive clauses of the US National Defense Act, which strictly limited the sale of equipment to allied nations such as Australia, are being removed and the United States is well advanced in that process.</para>
<para>While it may have added complexity, the US congress has weighed in as well. It is insisting on new levels of accountability from Defense and industry that were previously unknown. Industry did express some frustration at these reforms to me but it is also interesting to note how they have reacted otherwise. Many of the large prime manufacturers, for example, have moved to divest themselves of some of their own existing vertical integration. They say that this will provide added flexibility in a reduced market as well as reduced costs over time. At the middle level, however, there has also been a process of consolidation, which will no doubt lead to added efficiencies within the supply chain. The risk is that competition may be reduced somewhat, though compared with our own limited market that is hard to comprehend.</para>
<para>So we must therefore ask this question: what does this all mean for Australia and our own defence industries? One thing is inevitable—that is, the defence expenditure in the United States will continue to be reduced for the foreseeable future. The pressure from the administration to improve competition and productivity will be unrelenting—notwith-standing the traditional demands from constituencies in the United States. Above all, the capacity of the United States to become involved around the world will most likely change considerably. I note that the recent visit of the Secretary of State and the Secretary of Defense is somewhat symptomatic of that change.</para>
<para>There are some negative views on this. Those views focus narrowly on the fear that unit costs must increase for Australian purchases. I would put a contrary view. First, there has been a significant decline in the value of the US dollar, which is quite intentional—that is, the Australian dollar can now buy more and so can other currencies where the GFC has only had a limited effect. Next, US companies are clearly shaping up under the restructuring, and new procedural disciplines are being exercised in order to be much more efficient. With the surety of their own domestic markets reduced, they are becoming much more active in new markets. As they told me, Australia is a shining light not only as a valued ally but also because of the long-term financial commitment inherent in the government’s white paper. This long-term plan has committed hundreds of billions of dollars to defence procurement and sustainment over the next 20 years. No doubt other financially secure nations in the world will be similarly targeted—for example, Canada, Norway and Germany.</para>
<para>I can only conclude that the US industry will present significant new opportunities for Australian companies in the procurement market. The linkages already built by some should be of great advantage. Most importantly, cost savings ought to be in the offing, not to mention improved access to previously restricted technology. None of this should be news to Defence or the DMO, whose relationships with US Defense and industry are deep and extensive.</para>
<para>I am aware that the exchange of information at government level and at the bureaucratic level is improving even though, in reform, we clearly commenced much earlier, although we still have a long way to go. Added to this is the seriousness with which our relationship with US has developed more recently under the Gillard government. Rather than being threatened by the rationalisation of procurement in the US, I can only say to Australian companies that they should be eager to avail themselves of opportun-ities as they arise. Australia’s defence industry has the ball at its feet as the result of the government’s defence capital investment program. Never has there been such an opportunity as in the current relationship with the US government, a relationship which proffers such levels of cooperation. I must say that, during my briefing by US officials and company executives at the most senior levels, I was impressed by their understanding and appreciation of both sides of the relationship with Australia.</para>
<para>We might ask: what does all of this mean? Will there be any real change or will we just continue to plod on incrementally? The cynics might say, of course, that the more things change, the more they remain the same. My concern is that, within Defence in general, this could well be fair comment. Despite all of the reforming zeal which has been directed at procurement and military justice, for example, we are still seeing significant evidence of repeats of old behaviour. I refer in particular to the very disturbing evidence emerging from the HMAS <inline font-style="italic">Success</inline> inquiry, referred to publicly by Minister Smith. Although we were given all the assurances that the initial allegations were not true, it seems they are likely to be proven otherwise—or indeed even worse. Given the work done by the Senate in this area, this is quite disappoint-ing, especially the cultural attitude of denial which seems to continue and the regular failure of internal inquiries to reveal the absolute truth.</para>
<para>It is likewise, of course, with procurement. Last week’s revelation of difficulties with the MRH helicopter purchase so soon after the Seasprite disaster is very concerning and so is the revelation that the procurement of landing craft has been cancelled, having commenced back in 1997—more waste and incompetence, especially if it is correct that the original design was wrong, not to mention the faulty manufacture. Even more concerning is how this project slipped under the radar. Why did we not know about it as a project of concern? How many other failed projects are there which fall below the financial reporting threshold? The report of faulty keel laying for the first of the AWD’s in Melbourne suggests that, despite all the government’s pressure for reform, procurement pro-cesses remain, at best, problematic. This is depressing considering the strong intent of government. There has been a regular failure, or an apparent continuing failure, of Defence to make the necessary changes demanded and requested by successive ministers. The extent to which governments and ministers can manage Defence is therefore a matter of ongoing interest, especially when it comes to accountability for such a massive bureaucracy. This matter of accountability through the bureaucracy is a matter I will return to at another time.</para>

<para>—Thank you, Mr Acting Deputy President, for acknowledging the state which I am so proud to represent. Whilst responding in general to the Governor-General’s address to this house, I will firstly just touch on a couple of issues that have been raised by senators already. I thank Senator Hurley for her suggestion that nuclear energy is an issue that must be addressed and properly assessed and properly debated by this house. This is not a view that is shared, I know, by a lot of her colleagues but, if we are to go to a low emissions, energy efficient future, nuclear energy must be on the list. More and more of the research that is becoming available suggests that this can now be done, given rising power prices, at comparable cost to the ongoing use of coal. Of course the coal industry will continue to be a core part of Australia and Australia’s prosperity, not just internally but externally, for many years to come. But it is only sensible to now put nuclear energy on the agenda and I was pleased to hear Senator Hurley mention this as something that should happen.</para>
</talk.start>
<para>I will also comment, Mr Acting Deputy President, on some of the remarks that you made during your contribution to this debate. I can understand perfectly that you would want to comment on New South Wales—that you would not want to mention Queensland. Yet I would suggest that, if you had perhaps listened more carefully to the contribution of Senator Macdonald, you would have noticed, in his forensic analysis of what was wrong with Queensland Labor, that the attempts, over and over, to parachute people into seats where they were not known by the locals were one of the reasons for the complete slaughter of the federal Labor Party in the election in Queensland. As Senator Macdonald pointed out, there had been no Northern Queensland LNP members of the House of Representatives before the last election. There are now no Labor representatives in that area. It has been a clean sweep.</para>
<para>Moving further south to the seat of Longman, for which I was the patron senator, we were delighted to have a young man—in fact the youngest person ever elected to this parliament—Mr Wyatt Roy, win the election very convincingly. He is a local young man whose family has lived for generations in the electorate and who knows the voters of the electorate and the issues of the electorate. It is that sort of care taken when selecting candidates that is responsible—in part, along with very strong campaigning skills—for the success in Queensland.</para>
<para>So I certainly understand that Senator Hutchins would not want to reflect on the national result for Labor and would want to stick very carefully to his own state, which is one of the very few states in which Labor almost survived. Certainly there is nothing for Labor to be proud of in the election result that they achieved at the last election.</para>
<para>As many people have pointed out, it does seem a long time ago—and like a different world—that the Governor-General made her address to this place. As Senator Macdonald pointed out earlier, the Governor-General delivered a speech that had been written for her by the government, and I think if we look through that speech we will see that one of the biggest problems with it was its lack of a ‘vision thing’. There were very few real, practical suggestions for a way forward other than to continue some of the proposals that had been put up by Mr Rudd. As we know, most of those proposals have since been trashed completely. They have disappeared from the face of the earth.</para>
<para>It is interesting right now to reflect on the brave new world that Mr Rudd and Ms Gillard were supposed to be creating, where the blame game with the states would end and COAG would become a hotbed of collegial, fraternal and sisterly love. I do not know that we have seen any of this actually happen yet. I had the pleasure yesterday of attending the national conference of the Australian Health Care Reform Alliance. The alliance brings together 40 national and state organisations of health professionals, health consumers and health services. In the sense that it represents those three constituencies, it is unique. It has advocated actively for many years for a more equitable, efficient, robust, sustainable and accountable healthcare system and has put forward a lot of policies and principles that it believes will lead to a healthcare system that seamlessly and efficiently focuses on the needs of the individual and meets those needs. Can I say that the mood in the room at the conference yesterday was sombre at the very least. There was, in my view, a quiet sense of desperation. There was a sense of: ‘Why are we bothering to be here to talk about health care reform when sitting on our shoulder is the likelihood that the big, shiny hospitals and healthcare reform agenda of Mr Rudd and, allegedly, Ms Gillard is likely now to go down the drain, leading to even more inefficiencies in the system than we currently have?’</para>
<para>As an example, there was a session yesterday that talked about mental health. I have spoken in this place a number of times on mental health and the future of mental health. Labor has continued some of the Howard-Costello reforms, such as the introduction of PHaMS, the personal helpers and mentors scheme—after initially getting a bit confused around alternative therapy programs and better access to medical health, Ms Roxon yet again backed down on what she had initially thought was reform, put the program back pretty much as it was when the Howard government established it and put some more funding in—and the Labor government got ticks for that, but that is all they got ticks for.</para>
<para>Yesterday Senator Colbeck, from Tasmania, moved a motion in the Senate regarding the end of funding to a Tasmanian mental healthcare service. He characterised this as an organisation that is designed to stop people slipping through the cracks itself slipping through the cracks. I would also mention the Cairns Mental Health Carers Support Hub. This organisation was set up by professionals, consumers and carers in North Queensland, where there is a dearth of services. Wherever you go in Australia there is a dearth of services, but the further you get from the capital cities, the fewer are the services. This service in Cairns had been set up and was functioning well; it meant that for the first time in a very long time the parents and carers of adults with schizophrenia were somewhat more comfortable about the safety and care that was being offered to their adult children. Their funding is about to lapse, although it appears no-one can quite be bothered telling them whether or not it has lapsed. So, once again, we have a group designed to stop people slipping through the cracks that is itself slipping through the cracks. This is apparently the brave new world of the Labor government in the area of mental health.</para>
<para>I should mention that I know there were some people in the room at the Australian Health Care Reform Alliance conference yesterday and there are many others in the health area who are bitterly disappointed in this government. They listened to the talk that was talked by Mr Rudd, Ms Gillard and others and they thought there was going to be change; they thought there was going to be improvement. They are bitterly disappointed not only that this government has done almost nothing in this field but also that this government has betrayed them by talking about doing wonderful things and then doing less than nothing.</para>
<para>I would like to also mention the vision that could have been developed in the speech provided to the Governor-General by the government as to the development of Australia long term. If you look at many of the reports that are now being made, you see we finally seem to be getting people talking about a two-speed economy. Anybody in Queensland last year could have told you that there was a two-speed economy. If you were involved in the mining industry or supplied the mining industry, you were probably going okay. If you were not involved in the mining industry, you were in trouble as your business was in trouble. There were people talking about their turnovers being down 30 per cent or more. This was all happening last year whilst the government congratulated itself on full employment and whatever else. In some sectors, yes, there is a lack of skilled people to take jobs but this is masking the lack of turnover, the lack of production and the lack of jobs in other sectors of the community. This is particularly felt in a state that is not as reliant as, for example, Western Australia on the mining industry.</para>
<para>This was happening before the floods and cyclones. It has just been exacerbated, magnified dozens of times, by the floods and cyclones. Yet it appears the government continues to be interested in flood damaged businesses, homes and individuals—and it is the same with cyclones—without any concept that you do not have to be flood or cyclone damaged to be flood or cyclone affected. I do not know one individual who has not been so affected and I do not know one business in any part of Queensland, whether it is an agribusiness or whether it is a small business or a large business, that has not been affected in some way by the floods or cyclones. This might be a company where a major customer has gone broke because of the floods and cyclones. It might be a company where a major supplier cannot supply because of the cyclones and floods. It might be a company such as those in Kingaroy that could not actually get products sent to them because there was not an economically efficient route by which to send the products in. Trucking companies have had problems too with lost trucks, roads that they cannot use and customers that have not got anything for them to put on the trucks to send somewhere. It goes on and on and it affects every corner of Queensland but, in my view, this has not been acknowledged.</para>
<para>Nor is there any sort of basic plan underneath, other than to help now, to further build Queensland or Northern Australia or the Australian economy. I would like to look briefly at an organisation that I think deserves support in this place. It is called Australians for Northern Development &amp; Economic Vision. You might recall, Mr Acting Deputy President, a report from what was initially an inquiry, one that was started under Senator Heffernan and finished under the Rudd Labor government, into development in Northern Australia. Perhaps not surprisingly, the focus of that inquiry seemed to change radically. What we ended up with was a report that emphasised—and I do not think any of us needed to be told this—the environmental fragility of Northern Australia. It emphasised the need to develop small-scale Indigenous businesses in Northern Australia. No-one has any problems with those aims, but that is not where Australia’s economic future lies, nor are these things incompatible with real economic development in Australia. Australia’s economic future, as ANDEV point out, is as ‘a regional provider of seaborne minerals and coals and various other commodities’. They believe that without a vision and without input from the government Australia’s resource industry itself is at risk.</para>
<para>So where were the comments in the Governor-General’s address on things like the high rates of taxation in Australia compared to those of our competitors? In fact, if you look at personal tax and company tax, you see we are now looking at a carbon tax; we are now looking at an income tax allegedly to save the government and save the flood-prone and cyclone-prone areas. We have high wages compared with those of other countries. Great, and I think that’s fabulous, but we do need to acknowledge it and we do need to work out how we are going to develop a competitive system if we are to maintain that standard of living. There is absolutely no point in having high wage rates for people who are not employed. I do not think we should be changing the wage rates but we certainly need to acknowledge that we have an issue and a competition problem there.</para>
<para>Slow approval procedures are a very, very serious issue here. So much for the government that was going to reduce all the red tape. We get little reports on how many changes have been made or not made to legislation and yet the government fails to tell us that for every one that has been taken away there are currently about 15 that have been put in place. So the lack of red tape is just not happening.</para>
<para>The other concern is the current development of very large ore carriers by countries that compete with us to sell ore. The Asian ports are being modified to allow for these very large ore carriers. One of the ways we have been able to get over the fact that we have high taxation and high labour rates is that we are close to the markets that want the ore. When other countries in South America, South Africa and Canada can transport huge amounts of ore at competitive freight rates, we have nothing left to make us competitive with the others. So could I please beg this government to think just a little about the future of the country, not just how on earth it is going to stay in power and how it is going to meet the next interest rate bill in the very sad economic situation it has brought us to.</para>

<para>—I seek to make some remarks in the address-in reply and pick up a point that Senator Boyce made. There is a very good reason there was nothing in the Governor-General’s address-in-reply about the flood situation in Queensland. That is because it had not happened then. If Senator Boyce were really serious about helping not only the flood victims in Queensland but also the people whose livelihoods have been affected not directly by the flood but by the consequences of the flood, she would be lobbying in her own party to support the proposed flood levy of the federal government. That is really the only serious way that the people of Queensland who have been affected by these dreadful natural disasters are going to be assisted. That is what this federal government is seeking to do.</para>

<para>—Thank you for that protection, Mr Acting Deputy President. I certainly need it. What I have done in those four months is travel widely across Australia, meeting with communities who are all interested in the future of our water supplies and the best ways in which we can manage them. I have been particularly struck by the adaptability of these communities on the back of prolonged drought and many are now facing extraordinary flooding. That is the ancient cycle in Australia—drought, flood, drought, flood—but I continue to be amazed by the extremes we encounter in Australia and the likelihood that those extremes might increase over the years ahead.</para>
</talk.start>
</continue>
<para>Our thoughts and prayers are with those people in Queensland who have suffered the worst flooding in living memory and also those in Victoria, New South Wales and other areas who have been hit by floods. We extend our sympathies also to those who have felt the catastrophic impact of tropical Cyclone Yasi. Now the residents of Perth, who have experienced record dry weather, were dealt another blow over the weekend with devastating bushfires.</para>
<para>This dramatic variability emphasises the importance of the commitment of the Gillard government to a sustainable Australia. It reinforces our commitment to invest significant funds in a range of alternative water supplies such as desalination, water recycling, stormwater harvesting and reuse, and other water efficiency projects. Diversifying our water sources enables communities to manage water supplies across the wide range of weather and climatic events that Australia experiences. While much of the eastern part of the country has been suffering from floods, history has taught us that droughts will return.</para>
<para> The recent investment of the Gillard government in alternative water sources will save or supply significant volumes of water and will help us be better prepared to get through the next drought. We are working closely with local and state government partners who are responding to the demands of urban development and growing population. We are supporting projects that will use treated stormwater in major cities across Australia and regions such as Dubbo. Since I took on the role of parliamentary secretary, I have launched stormwater-harvesting projects worth $7.6 million—$4.5 million being for the Dubbo City Council stormwater-harvesting and reuse project under the $904 million National Urban Water and Desalination Plan. The Dubbo project will capture, treat and distribute about 42 million litres of stormwater each year to be used on the Apex Oval in the town and in the East Dubbo Sporting Complex. I went up there with a person whom I think you might know, Mr Acting Deputy President, Mayor Allan Smith, a very good mayor of Dubbo and a very fine fellow.</para>
<para>In October, I announced $3.1 million in funding for five stormwater-harvesting schemes to be constructed in the city of Hobsons Bay in Victoria. Looking forward, the Australian government’s stormwater-harvesting grants program will soon open for its $100 million third round, as committed by the government in the 2010 election. Underpinning the investments is the establishment of the national centres of excellence in desalination and water recycling and the National Centre for Groundwater Research and Training. These centres are bringing together national and international researchers to address the complexity of securing urban water supplies in a practical way.</para>
<para>In December I announced the National Centre of Excellence in Desalination’s second round of funding. Through the second round the centre is providing nearly $3 million in funding for research projects investing in ways to advance desalination technology. One of those projects—and I am sure Senator Bernardi will be interested in this—is being conducted by researchers at Flinders University in his home state of South Australia, which is also my home state. And a great state it is, isn’t it, Senator Bernardi?</para>

<para>—We can agree on something. The project, which I visited in December, is developing coatings that will reduce biofouling of the reverse osmosis membranes—that is not easy to say—used to take the salt out of the water. Biofouling can reduce the performance of the membranes which, in turn, can increase the cost. So, by reducing the extent of the problem, the costs of desalination can be brought down.</para>

<para>In November last year I was proud to announce the opening of a pioneering groundwater replenishment trial in Perth—even drinking some recycled water on that occasion—that received more than $19 million in Australian government funding. This important project has the potential to substantially offset the impact of the decline in inflows to Perth’s dams that has occurred over the last 30 years. It is interesting to note that, if you drew a line from, say, Geraldton to Adelaide, there was rainfall everywhere east of that line, but in the remaining portion, particularly around Perth, they continued to have very severe drought conditions. This project that I am speaking about will trial the world’s best, state-of-the-art managed aquifer recharge technology and will test the impact of the groundwater replenishment on aquifer water quality.</para>
<para>The Gillard government is also delivering more than $11 million in funding to a landmark water recycling project in West Werribee in Victoria. As you would probably know, West Werribee is a dramatically expanding part of Melbourne. I can see Senator Ryan nodding in agreement with that because he has probably been there as well. This project will take recycled water from Melbourne Water’s Western Treatment Plant and further process it to reduce salt and then inject it into the underground aquifer for storage. The water will then be available for use in home gardens, for toilet flushing and in public open spaces through the West Werribee Dual Supply project. Research efforts and projects like these will help future water managers to manage our water supplies through the peaks and troughs of increasing climate variation. The Gillard government is delivering on its commitment to sustainable urban water management across the nation through projects that help consumers better manage their water use.</para>
<para>In December I travelled to Senator Carol Brown’s home state and visited Hobart to launch the Water Metering Tasmania project. The Gillard government is providing $10 million to Tasmania’s three water corporations to install water meters to unmetered properties and to upgrade meters that do not meet required standards in regional Tasmania. The project is expected to save more than eight billion litres of water a year through improved detection and repair of leaks. The smart meters will make it very clear if you have a leak on your property, which you will be able to act on rather than wait until an expensive bill comes through. The meters will also enable consumers to make informed choices to better manage their water usage.</para>
<para>A few days later I was in Maryborough in Queensland where, unfortunately, the impacts of that state’s flood crisis have since been felt. While in Maryborough I was very impressed by the town’s Proud Mary: Modernising Maryborough’s Water Systems project. The Gillard government has committed $5.7 million to the project, which involves an integrated suite of activities that will improve the efficiency of the town’s water supply system. One of those activities will be the rollout of more than 9,000 smart water meters which can be read remotely using a receiver. This system was demonstrated to me in nearby Hervey Bay where hundreds of meters are read in minutes using the technology, and where consumers have access to detailed information about their water use.</para>
<para>Water resource management is supported by our authorities: the Bureau of Meteorology and the National Water Commission. In October last year I was very pleased to officially launch the first national water storage information website hosted by the Bureau of Meteorology. I know that, if Senator Bernardi has an iPad, he can download a map that will now give him that updated information. This new product is an important step in providing the Australian community with a consistent and comprehensive national picture of Australia’s water resources, pretty much in real time.</para>
<para>I was also very happy, in December, to visit the picturesque town of Esperance, not that far from Yorke Peninsula, on the southern coast of Western Australia, to open a purpose-built new Bureau of Meteorology observation office. The office features a new 14-metre-high radar tower, which is double the height of the one it replaced, which will provide higher resolution weather surveillance at a greater range.</para>
<para>In terms of sustainability, in November, it was my great pleasure to attend the switch-on event for Sydney Theatre Company’s Greening the Wharf project. The project, which is supported by the government with $1.2 million in funding through our Green Precincts Fund, features the second largest rooftop photovoltaic array in the country. Senator Bernardi would be interested to know that the largest one, of course, is at the Adelaide Showground. It is expected to produce up to 70 per cent of Sydney Theatre Company’s energy requirements, while an innovative rainwater harvesting, storage and reticulation system will supply 100 per cent of the company’s non-potable water.</para>
<para>But Green Precincts projects are not just about energy and water savings. The Greening the Wharf project will create a showcase green precinct at a well-recognised harbour-side wharf. Its value includes the demonstration of sustainable practices to the very large number of people, more than 300,000 each year, who attend the Sydney Theatre Company. It also demonstrates that significant sustainability practices can be undertaken at important heritage sites.</para>
<para>Sustainability and water security continue to be vitally important issues for Australia now and in the future. The extreme and tragic weather events we have seen across Australia in the past few weeks—floods, cyclones and fire—illustrate the unpredictable nature of our nation. While much of the country in the east is now experiencing flood, it is not so long ago that much of Australia was besieged by drought. As we, the Gillard government, work together with state and local governments to rebuild those areas hardest hit in recent times we will not be distracted from the importance of urban water reform and securing Australia’s water supplies for the future, whatever the weather may bring.</para>

<para>—It is a pleasure to join the debate on the address-in-reply and support the amendment moved by Senator Abetz. The address-in-reply is a rare opportunity to address the entirety of the government rather than any single measure or, in this case, any single failure of a government. Indeed, this is my first opportunity to do so, given that I arrived in this place many months after the 2007 election.</para>
</talk.start>
<para>This government provides a wide array of material to work with, but today I would like to skip over many of the specific examples that have been covered in such depth by my colleagues because I want to outline and debate what I consider to be a flaw at the core of this government. All of its failings—its waste, its massive deficit and debt, its raiding of various capital funds put in place by the previous government for future generations of Australia and even its political failures—reflect a weakness at its core. This government suffers from several fatal conceits. It suffers from the conceit that its core functions can be taken for granted as it relentlessly expands the scope of its own activities to suit the desires of its members. It suffers from the fatal conceit that it can tax relentlessly not only to feed its own voracious spending and debt but also to covertly limit the choices of individuals in our society and guide them to what its own members deem to be appropriate behaviour.</para>
<para>This government has no sense of its own limitations, it has no sense of the limitations of the state and it especially lacks a sense of the limitations of the personnel that comprise it. When it is warned about the flaws in its programs it reacts by simply playing the man, to use the football vernacular. History tells us, however, that it was warned about the blow-outs in the school halls and the waste with the pink batts. But this government ignored the warnings and, despite the efforts of the Prime Minister, these failures will follow her in office, whether she is the real Julia or not. This government’s profligate spending has driven our budget into record deficit and, despite all its claims and all its spin, there is one simple economic truth about this matter: debt is simply deferred taxation; it is taxation upon future generations of Australia. As the government seeks to raise taxes now in a desperate attempt to manufacture a tiny surplus for an election several years hence, the Australian people do not trust its motives nor do they trust its management.</para>
<para>One of the major issues of last year, and one of the issues listed by the current Prime Minister as a reason for the removal of the former Prime Minister, was the mining tax. What was a resource super profits tax became a mineral resource rent tax. None of the constitutional or administrative issues have been addressed in either. It was right that this became the subject of debate, despite the verballing of some of the proponents of that debate by members of the government. Thousands of Australians work in this industry and its associated industries. Some work in information technology. Some work in construction equipment. The money flows right through the economy, even to my home city of Melbourne, which is a long way from many of the mining centres. The government justified the tax simply by attacking the profits of those who mine. At a particular low point in the debate, some people also went as far as to attack the nationality of the shareholders or the companies of those who mine, in an appalling, retrograde reminder of economic Hansonism in this country. But only in the world of academic economists, or the Canberra bureaucracy, would a government try to determine what an appropriate profit would be and use that definition to levy nothing short of a punitive tax.</para>
<para>Underlying the whole tax problem in this is a flawed economic assumption about economic rent with respect to iron ore and coal. The truth about these products is that, unlike oil or a precious metal, coal and iron ore are not rare. The capital to get them to market is rare, even though that in itself is being applied dramatically all around the world as we speak. What is rare temporarily is the access to markets of mass quantities of those commodities, and Australia is in a position to benefit from that at the moment. Yet all around the world, in Africa, in South America and in Russia, what we are seeing is a dramatic expansion in the facilities that will bring those products to market. This is only a temporary spike, even though it will probably lead to a long-term increase in our terms of trade.</para>
<para>Ironically, the Labor government of the 1980s introduced the Petroleum Resource Rent Tax. One of the ministers involved was a former senator, Peter Walsh, and it was Peter Walsh who said in his memoirs: ‘There is rarely any economic rent in iron ore.’ That did not come from this side; it came from the person who helped set up the PRRT. Unlike this government, Peter Walsh, who I respect, had a basic understanding of economic principles. Peter Walsh was one of the ministers who took difficult decisions, and later I will go to more of what Peter Walsh did which this government has ignored. That is an important point. When the PRRT, which this government tried to compare the MRRT and the RSPT to, was set up, one of the people involved wrote: ‘There is rarely any economic rent in iron ore.’ But this government would not take notice of such a Labor luminary, and not just because he was one of the first to warn the nation about the rise of green fanaticism and green rent seeking, which this government has been such a part of; he also warned the ALP about the risk the green movement would pose to their political future. But that is not my concern here today.</para>
<para>This government, through taxes like this, seeks to plan our economy by defining what an appropriate profit is. If anyone thinks that the mining industry will be the only industry subject to such a definition then they are foolish. We heard the promise before the election that there would not be a price on carbon, the euphemism used to try and avoid saying what it actually is: a tax. Only days after the election, the Prime Minister not only back-flipped but tried to justify this as some far-reaching economic reform. In 1998 when this side of politics took tax reform to the Australian people we outlined exactly what was involved in that tax reform. It is a cowardly government and Prime Minister that says one thing two days before an election and then tries to hide in the cloak of reform only days after in a desperate attempt to stay sitting on the right of the Speaker in the other place.</para>
<para>But that is only the start. We have the carbon tax. Very soon, despite promises to the contrary, we will probably have a junk food tax of some variety as the government seeks to tell people what they can and cannot eat. In all the papers from all the so-called health experts who seek to tell people in Australia what they can eat and how to live their lives, I am fascinated that the taxes always seem to land on Big Macs rather than on foie gras. But that might be a reflection of the tastes of the people writing the reports.</para>
<para>We have in the Henry review the flagging of a congestion tax. For the first time we are going to try and tax the movement of people in this country. Through the creation of a false market by the effective granting of licences to use roads paved by our grandparents, our parents and people today the governments will seek to institute what 30 years ago was a parody in movies from Hollywood. The government will determine where you are allowed to travel. They may deny it now but they have said that the Henry review on tax was merely an attempt to stake out territory for future government efforts. This side of the chamber will not allow such a regressive expansion of the role of government. This government seeks to make respectable what was once inconceivable. I put to you that, if we went back in time 20 years, the idea that there could be a tax on the movement of people in our cities would have been laughed at.</para>
<para>Like with many others things—such as poker machines—this government seeks to use technology as it was used in <inline font-style="italic">1984</inline>. The only thing that George Orwell got wrong was the timing of technological development. The motive of those people opposite is still present. And this government seeks to clothe its intentions in the language of reform. Because of its desperate need to find a purpose, it harks back to the 1980s. But let us measure and compare the differences between the people that sit opposite me today and the people in this parliament in the 1980s and the 1990s who dramatically changed this country for the better.</para>

<para>—I had forgotten about that, Senator Bernardi. The 1980s and 1990s were about governments saying no. The government and political leaders in this country on both sides of politics—at least until 1996—said then that they could not stand between the people of Australia and the rest of the world. They said that they could no longer protect a dying car industry that was making cars that no-one wanted to buy. Let me use a simple example: who in Australia today wishes that they could go down to their local Retravision store and pick up an $800 19-inch colour television set? No-one does. We are dramatically better off for having opened trade barriers. We are dramatically better off due to having freed our economy up and having given people the choice to spend their money in the way that they choose, not in the way that the government chooses.</para>
</talk.start>
</continue>
<para>The difference between this government and the governments from the 1980s and the 1990s is clear. For 70 or 80 years in this country, the government tried to tell you what you could buy through punitive tariffs and quotas, which made alternatives expensive. It penalised primary producers and miners for decade after decade to protect people in the cities. This government might not want to reinstitute those same trade barriers but it still wants to tell you what to buy. It wants to say, ‘Don’t use your air conditioner on a hot day.’ I recall, Acting Deputy President Fisher, the Premier of your home state, and sadly he is still the Premier, on a particularly hot day—it was 45 degrees—in February 2009 in the weeks leading up to the tragedy of Black Saturday in my home state and that heatwave saying something along the lines of, ‘People should seriously reconsider whether they need to use their air conditioners today.’ Can we consider the absurdity of that statement? No-one buys an air conditioner for a 25-degree day. The idea that we should tell people, many of them mothers with children, senior Australians and retirees, that that day is the kind of day that they should reconsider using their air conditioner when it was going to hit 45 degrees is laughable. It is like us going back 50 years and telling people not to turn the fridge on.</para>
<para>The people opposite, along with their Green allies, are seeking to determine personal, private and individual choices. They constrained the development of technology and measures like generation capacity for decades to somehow justify the contrived market that they seek to create. They talk about electricity prices, but they will not allow supply to be added to. They talk about prices on carbon, and yet do not understand that their ability to measure and police it is virtually nil.</para>
<para>The 1980s was an era of deregulation. It was an era of privatisation. It was a lot easier before 1996, when we were sitting on this side of the chamber. That era involved the government telling people that it cannot solve their problems and asking people to take more responsibility. As I said in my maiden speech in this place, this government is throwing away the legacy of the 1980s and the thousands of people who lost their jobs and careers, particularly in manufacturing, and made legitimate sacrifices for future generations. This government is seeking to institute other forms of control over the economy, all of which have a dramatic cost, not the least of which is their idea that somehow a profit is super and the government should be able to take extra from it.</para>
<para>I have noticed that this government has lately compared the carbon tax to the floating of the dollar. I do not understand how they cannot see the irony. They cannot see that not having the scientific or testing means to measure or set a carbon limit that is enforceable is the opposite of the government nearly 30 years ago saying that they were unable to set the level of the dollar. This government thinks that it is omnipotent and that it can set all things in the economy. Paul Keating used to say that he could pull the levers. These people think that the economy is a keyboard that they can jump on. All of this government’s alleged reforms involve it doing more, taxing more and telling Australians how to live and what to choose a lot more. That is something to which this opposition is committed to keeping at the forefront of Australians’ minds. This government wants to tell you what to eat. It wants to tell you where and when you can drive. They want to tell you where you can use an air conditioner. They have overweening hubris and no sense of their own limitations.</para>
<para>This government has capitalised on what one could call ‘expressive politics’. It does not matter what you actually do. It does not matter that, tragically, people died in the home insulation bungle. It does not matter that billions were wasted on the school halls fiasco. It only matters what you ‘care’ about. Platitudes and ‘caring’ are the easiest things for politicians to do. Actually sitting down and doing things and making sure they work, that they respect the needs of the community and that they represent value for money for taxpayers is the hard bit, and that is what this government has been an abject failure in. In the address we heard last year there was no indication that the government had learnt that lesson whatsoever. This is a government that seeks to define itself purely by its aspirations, where what it aspires to is more important than the actual outcomes. It seeks to defer, delay and obfuscate any sense of measurement of what it has actually achieved.</para>
<para>But, as well as eventually bringing about the end of this Labor government—about which I am confident—there is something more concerning about this: this is actually reducing public faith in the political process. This government said that, if you argued against the BER school halls waste, somehow you were against education. Who in the Australian community did not think there was a better way to invest $13 billion in our education system than putting school halls over schoolyards, in some places that were ill-fitting and overpriced? I could think of some. My mother is a teacher; my uncle is a teacher. I am particularly passionate about this. To think what we could have got for that money, which can never be regained: it is a tragedy for every Australian child that will go through those schools.</para>
<para>When it comes to the environment, despite its vilification of those sitting on this side of the chamber, I do recall that it was not those sitting over there to your right, Madam Acting Deputy President, who had a policy on climate change going into the election—other than a citizens assembly, which we tend to force people to go and vote for. That was rightly ridiculed. It still even shocks me that someone who was Prime Minister, or someone who works in a Prime Minister’s office—or whoever came up with the idea—would even conceive that, during a campaign for an election to the national parliament, we should randomly pick a focus group and play with the agenda to contrive a particular outcome. That is the real danger: as slogans become more important than outcomes, it reduces faith in the political process. This side of politics is committed to outcomes, and we will stand against the contrived slogans of this government as well as its long-term threat to the wellbeing of the Australian economy and the liberty of the Australian people.</para>

<para>—As I rise to speak to this address-in-reply I am reminded of the first Governor-General’s speech that I listened to almost 18 years ago. It seems that, no matter how much things change, the more they stay the same. We had a Labor government back then. The Keating government had just been re-elected, full of promises. There was one difference, of course: the Keating government was elected by a reasonable majority. After the 2010 election we had a government that was not wanted by just about 50 per cent of the Australian people—as near to 50 per cent as you can get. The thing that was the same, of course, was the fact that the Keating government was elected with a blaze of promises—and, as soon as it was re-elected, just like the Gillard government, it started to break those promises. I can still remember L-A-W tax cuts! Who can’t? The Labor government went to the election promising ‘It’s in law: L-A-W’, and the minute that government was re-elected that promise was broken. And here we have, after the 2010 election, the same trail of broken promises already, when this government has only been in place for barely six months. We have the same trail of broken promises, which are highlighted in the amendment that has been moved by Senator Abetz, as Leader of the Opposition in the Senate. That amendment details the promises that were broken immediately, once they were able to cobble together a government—and I call it ‘cobbling together’.</para>
</talk.start>
<para>I cannot think of a worse combination than a national government that is held to ransom by the Greens. I cannot think of a worse combination. For those who will be here after 1 July, I say: I do not envy your task, as we see the Greens put pressure on this government, which relies on their support to stay in power. I am fearful of the outcomes that might pass this Senate following 1 July, when the Greens hold the balance of power in this place.</para>
<para>I came in here for a short time during this debate and listened to Senator Hurley extolling the virtues of this government. Not only that but she managed to mention the virtues of the South Australian government as well, another government which got less than 50 per cent of the popular vote yet still managed to hang onto government. I heard Senator Hurley talking about the wonderful assistance to the car industry. I can only assume she was referring to the cash for clunkers! I cannot think what else she would have been talking about when she talked about assistance to the car industry in South Australia. She then went on to extol the virtues of the former Treasurer of South Australia, Mr Kevin Foley, a man the Labor Party factions decided to kick out from his job only last week, so that he lost the deputy premiership and lost the Treasury. And here she is extolling the virtues of Mr Foley and what he had done for South Australia! I am quite amazed when I hear someone, I guess for party purposes, coming in here and talking about someone working in a state government and what a wonderful job they have done.</para>
<para>Senator Ryan, in speaking just before me, highlighted the issue of waste. I think that, if there is anything that typifies this government—the Labor government since 2007, both the Rudd government and the Gillard government—it is the waste of taxpayers’ money.</para>
<para>The one thing that has not changed in the nearly 18 years that I have been in this place is that people still think that, if the government is providing them with something, it is not costing them anything, it is somebody else’s money. They forget that it is their money, it is the taxpayers’ money—and we in this place should be ever-vigilant to ensure that the taxpayers’ money is not being wasted. The government is spending the money on their behalf. And if it cannot get value for money then in fact the government of the day is not performing its function properly, it is not doing its job, it is leaving the taxpayers short changed. This government, over the past three years, both the Rudd government and the Gillard government, has short-changed the Australian people by spending their taxes in a reckless manner: the second phase of the stimulus package, the school halls, the pink batts—you could go on and on. I see Senator Conroy is here. We might even add the NBN. Is that a proper function of the spending of taxpayers’ money? Could it be done in a cheaper way? The United States are not putting out a National Broadband Network in the same way. They certainly would not do that, as Senator Conroy well knows. We do not have any cost-benefit analysis or anything like that, which any government worth its salt—</para>

<para>I want to talk about another matter which is particular to my state just at present and it deals with minerals exploration and mining. I am a great supporter of mining exploration and the minerals industry in Australia and the tremendous work that they do. The resources that we have in Australia contribute largely to allowing us to have the lifestyle that we currently lead. But I am not a supporter of exploration for mining at all costs. We have a situation in South Australia right now in which the state Labor government has just reactivated a minerals exploration licence for Marathon Resources in the Arkaroola sanctuary in the northern Flinders Ranges of South Australia. I have been to Arkaroola and seen this unique sanctuary. It is only a small area. We almost have more uranium resources in Australia than we know what to do with—some of it unexplored yet.</para>

<para>—We are not allowed to use it, that is right. We can sell it to other people but they do not like us using it. Arkaroola, where Doug and Marg Sprigg have continued the work of their parents in the Arkaroola Wilderness Sanctuary, is quite a unique part of South Australia. Only two years ago Marathon Resources were found to have breached the requirements of their exploration licence and had allowed waste products to be left there in a manner in which they were not entitled to. They have now had their exploration licence reactivated. I am totally opposed to the exploration of minerals, particularly uranium and maybe rare earths, in the Arkaroola Wilderness Sanctuary because it is such a unique part of Australia.</para>
</talk.start>
</continue>
<para>I hope that the state government in South Australia will come to its senses. It says that exploration does not mean that it would allow a mining licence. If you are not going to allow people to mine minerals, why on earth would you allow them to explore for minerals within that area? My support goes to those people particularly in the Liberal Party and many of my state colleagues who are opposed to exploration in the Arkaroola Wilderness Sanctuary. I hope that at some stage in the future there will be some sensible decisions taken which will allow Arkaroola to remain that wonderful wilderness sanctuary that it is and that the tremendous tourist operation and environmental protection that has been put in place by the Sprigg family will remain.</para>
<para>I could go on about many of the broken promises and the waste of this government, but I am not going to because it is all highlighted in the amendment that has been moved by Senator Abetz. However, I particularly refer to the carbon tax. Specifically at election time, the Prime Minister said that there would be ‘no carbon tax in Australia’. She gave an assurance during the campaign that there would be no carbon tax. So what happens when you cobble together an agreement with some Independents and the Greens as soon as the election is over and the government has been cobbled together? That promise is immediately broken and we now have the intention to introduce a carbon tax. My views on this issue are well known and I am not going to expand on them now. But that just highlights what we can expect from this current government—a party of higher taxation, a party that would wish to control our daily lives.</para>
<para>We have only to look at the current issue of restrictions on gambling that Independents, who wield considerable power in the lower House, are trying to put in place. I do not want to be living in an Australia where the government controls every action of our daily lives. We are all individual citizens. Anything that is done in regard to gambling or all the other things that this government would wish to control is a matter for the individual to decide and it should be left to individuals to make their own way in society.</para>
<para>This is the last time that I will speak in an address-in-reply debate. I look forward to the day when some of the issues that were raised by the Governor-General in her speech on behalf of the government are not issues of conflict between both sides of parliament and that we get to the stage where we will have a government of a different political persuasion that will govern in the interests of all Australians, that will allow for the individual freedoms that we stand for, and have always stood for, and that does not want to control the day-to-day activities of Australians in the way that this government does. I commend the amendment that has been moved by Senator Abetz to the address-in-reply and I urge senators to give it their support.</para>

<para>—I rise to make some remarks on the <inline ref="R4424">Family Assistance Legislation Amendment (Child Care Budget Measures) Bill 2010</inline>. I am very pleased to speak on this today because it is important that we place very clearly on the record that the coalition are opposed to this legislation. This bill sets the cap for the childcare rebate at $7,500 per annum and completely suspends the indexation of that rebate until 2014. Currently, the cap is set at $7,778. Not only will there be a reduction in the cap; there will also be the associated suspension of the indexation.</para>
</talk.start>
<para>As a mother of two children, who are now 18 and 16, of course I remember when they were much younger and when I needed to avail myself of childcare services. What is extraordinary about this legislation is that the government are making it harder, not easier, for families to access child care and to get assistance for childcare fees. To me, that is the antithesis of what this government should be doing for families, particularly families in regional areas. It is quite extraordinary that the government should do this for a savings measure—I think it is predicted to save $86 million over four years. Since when did the working families of this country become the cash cow for this government? We should be assisting families with their childcare expenses not making it harder, as Julia Gillard and this government are proposing. Aren’t we supposed to make sure that the future of this country is in the best possible hands and that families have the best possible assistance to bring up their children from day one, from when they are babies? Extraordinarily, this government seem to be turning their backs on the working families whom they purport to assist.</para>
<para>This childcare rebate is so important to so many families. Many of the people I speak to, particularly in the regional areas, say to me how important it is that they have this financial assistance to assist them with their childcare expenses. But around 20,700 families will be affected by this legislation. Over 20,000 families will face this cap on their childcare rebate, with no chance of any increase whatsoever over the next four years. That is simply wrong. I do not know if the Prime Minister has had a brain snap but that will not assist working families with the costs of child care no matter which way you look at it. It will do exactly the opposite.</para>
<para>It is yet another example of this government saying one thing and doing another thing. It is all about the words. It all about spin. It is all about the political spin for the next day’s media cycle and getting the words out. It is not about the reality of delivering for the Australian people, particularly working families who need the assistance. The government seem to be completely at a loss to come up with any sort of substantive policy or any vision for the future for this country. If part of their vision for the future is to make things tougher for working families and to make it harder with childcare expenses, are they on the right track! Sorry for the sarcasm. They are completely inept. They have absolutely no understanding of what families need out there in our communities, particularly our regional communities. That is very obvious given this legislation before us today. It is quite extraordinary.</para>
<para>They have no ability to think about anything other than getting re-elected. What good is that to the Australian people? Every single day, every waking thought for the Prime Minister and her band of merry men and women is, ‘Gee, what are we going to do today to make sure we get re-elected?’ As my very good colleague Senator Ferguson said earlier, we see an extraordinary arrangement in government at the moment. But that is a conversation for another day. It is all about getting re-elected; it is not about doing the right thing by this country. Colleagues, when did you last hear the word ‘vision’ used by the government? When did you last hear the government talk about their plan for the future of this country? When did you ever hear anything at all from the government about how it wants the country to look in 10 years time, 20 years time or 30 years time? You will not hear any of that, colleagues, because they are a vacuum. This Labor government have absolutely no idea how to govern. They have no idea how to set a path for the Australian people. It is all about spin. It is all about getting the words out. It is all about making sure they get re-elected next time—which might be a little tougher given the current arrangements.</para>
<para>The Australian people are rightly disappointed with this Prime Minister. A lot of them are telling me that she has not been up to scratch. They had much higher expectations of what this Prime Minister would deliver for this country. They are quite rightly very disappointed that the Prime Minister of the country appears to have no vision or ideas for where this country is going to go. It is all just reactionary. It is all just spin. It is all just words. Interestingly enough, I have an intern in my office, Nawaaz Khalfan, who is a very bright young boy about to start his university career, and he said to me: ‘Where is the country going? Where are we headed under this government?’</para>

<para>—I see that Senator Conroy has woken up. That is very exciting. Perhaps you could wake up enough to have a discussion with your Prime Minister about how making things harder for families when it comes to child care is probably not the best way forward. Perhaps if you took a little bit of time to have that discussion with your leader, Senator Conroy, maybe you can enlighten her about how this is a shocking bit of legislation.</para>
</talk.start>
</continue>
<para>All of those parents out there who are struggling and working hard to make ends meet and need to use childcare facilities are now going to do it that much harder because of Julia Gillard and this Labor government. It is as simple as that. Because of this Labor government families are going to do it tougher than they otherwise would have. I do not think that that is something that the people of Australia want to hear. Yet that is what they are stuck with.</para>
<para>How important is it to this government that we are able to support our children and access childcare facilities and have that financial assistance, recognising how important it is for families? No, not this government, ‘We will just make it a bit tougher.’ There is a really good idea. Like the independent youth allowance, ‘Let’s make that a bit tougher for students as well.’ There is another really good idea! It is anything but a good idea. Again, that is a conversation for a later time.</para>
<para>One has to wonder how much this government really does care about families and the future of Australia. You would have to say, for all intents and purposes, ‘Not very much.’ What have we seen it do? Firstly, and the real biggie, we have seen it completely mismanage the finances of this country. We only have to look at the billions of dollars of waste in the pink batts program and the billions of dollars of waste right across the board. There was the mismanagement of the school halls program.</para>
<para>Let us not forget the $900 cheques—that was a really good idea. I heard a story from north-west New South Wales about the $900 cheques. A farmer up there had a backpacker on his place for a while. I remember when all that happened and the backpacker called him up and said, ‘Can you thank your Prime Minister for me for my $900 cheque?’ while he was sitting in a pub in London. The Australian people deserve better. They deserve a government that has their best interests at heart.</para>
<para>I will move to slightly more recent times. Let us have a look at the flood tax. This government has proposed a tax on the Australian people that will make it even tougher for them to manage. We have rising costs of living and rising electricity prices. Thank you very much, Kristina Keneally, for the great management of the electricity situation in New South Wales.</para>

<para>—And John Brumby. It is just extraordinary that the government is now looking to place another tax—the flood tax—on the Australian people. It is interesting that, if the government had not wasted billions and billions of dollars, there would be absolutely no need for the tax. This is a point that the Australian people need to recognise very clearly: this Labor government under Julia Gillard is putting forward a flood tax only because it mismanaged the economy so badly that it simply has no choice but to try to gain some money in any way, shape or form. So it came up with a tax.</para>
</talk.start>
</continue>
<para>If the government had not wasted those billions of dollars on those programs—because it simply cannot manage money—we would not even need to be talking about a tax. As my good colleague in the other place the member for Riverina said recently, ‘The best management for natural disasters is for a government to have a surplus.’ He is absolutely spot-on and that is what we left this government—a $20 billion surplus. The government got rid of that pretty darn quickly, didn’t it? It is true to form. Successive Labor governments have had no understanding of how to manage money or an economy. They just keep spending.</para>

<para>—Senator Polley, I would like to hear your plan for the economic management of the country. I would be happy to hear from you on that. We have a situation now where we are borrowing around $100 million a day. This government is completely inept. The government borrowed $4 billion just last week.</para>

<para>Imagine if we said this to our kids, ‘Okay, we have completely mismanaged the household budget. The debt has racked up to a huge limit. We are completely out of control. By the way, we are going to hop into your little piggy bank for a flood tax, kids. Give us that as well because we have been so bad at managing the money.’ That is the analogy: you are going into the piggy banks of the Australian people because you are so inept and you have not got a single clue about how to manage an economy. That is not fair to the Australian people. When we have a budget of more than $350 billion, it is simply not on for this government to not be able to find savings of $1.8 billion but instead choose to tax the Australian people. They cannot possibly think outside of the box: ‘We are in a bit of a financial situation, what do we do?’ ‘I know, a tax will be the go because that is what we always do and that is what we’re comfortable with. Taxing the Australian people is a really good idea.’</para>

<para>On the flood tax, I could not help but be rather intrigued by the Prime Minister, in the commentary box at one of the cricket games, talking about matching the Australian people’s donations dollar for dollar. Well, guess what: that dollar for dollar matching is still the Australian people’s money. The Prime Minister does not have a bucket of money neatly tied up underneath Parliament House. She was only committing more of the Australian people’s money and what really concerns me is that Australian people are so generous. They are so generous, and they have donated so much through these very difficult times. Now that the government is talking about a flood tax these people are coming to me and saying: ‘Hang on, but I have donated. I was very happy to donate. I really want to help the people around the country who are dealing with such difficult times following these natural disasters. I really want to help them, but now the government is going to whack a tax on me. Why on earth did I bother donating in the first place?’ By all accounts the charities are saying that those generous donations have dried up since the announcement of the flood tax—a tax that we only need because of this government’s bad management and bad decision making.</para>

<para>—Thank you, I will take that interjection, Senator Williams—the mining tax, the car tax. We did notice that they managed to get rid of the cash for clunkers though, didn’t they, in amongst all of this tax business? Cash for clunkers—there was another brilliant policy idea from the government! All this ties into the bad management and bad policy decisions that are being made by this government. The bill that we are talking about today, the  <inline ref="R4424">Family Assistance Legislation Amendment (Child Care Budget Measures) Bill 2010</inline>, is yet another bad policy decision being made by this government. In simple terms, to anybody listening around the country, to anybody that is paying attention right now, this childcare bill is going to make things tougher for working families in Australia, not easier. It is this Labor government that is going to make things tougher for Australian families through this bill. That is just unacceptable. The very people the government should be helping by assisting them with their childcare costs, by helping them with a rebate, have had this government turn its back on them. This government is making it harder.</para>
</talk.start>
</continue>
<para>I would pretty much bet, and I think I am pretty safe in betting this one, that every single family that has children, or a child, in child care is going to look at this legislation and say: ‘What on earth is the government doing? Why are they making it tougher for me?’ It is hard enough with the rising costs of living—electricity prices, fuel costs and the cost of education—particularly in regional areas, where things are much tougher for people in terms of accessing services and where costs are much higher than in the cities. They are going to look at this government and say: ‘What are they doing? Why are they making it harder for us? I need to have my children,’ or my child, ‘in child care. Why are they coming up with this piece of legislation to make it even harder for me?’ Now that is just not on. This government has no idea about the needs of families in this country and this piece of legislation proves it. How can they possibly say with any credibility that they are for working families when a piece of legislation like this is going to hurt those very working families that they say they support? It is just ridiculous. It is yet another case of this government having absolutely no idea of the needs of Australian families. It is about time they started listening to the Australian people, started paying attention. Maybe one-day, colleagues, they could come up with a substantive bit of policy that is not going to hurt Australian families like this piece of legislation is going to do. We do not agree with it. We oppose it. This Labor government should be making things easier for working families and not harder.</para>

<para>—I rise to make some remarks in relation to the <inline ref="R4424">Family Assistance Legislation Amendment (Child Care Budget Measures) Bill 2010</inline>. At the beginning of a new year it is a shame that Senator Nash is still as confused as she was last year and is still using the same old lines that she used last year. With her attack on the Prime Minister about her lack of vision for the future, which was totally unfounded, I think the Australian people have actually seen the vision of the Leader of the Opposition. They certainly have not been silent in coming to my office and bringing to my attention their view about the Leader of the Opposition, his vision and his lack of commitment to the people that have been suffering in Queensland. So I think the priorities are very different and they certainly are different on this side.</para>
</talk.start>
<para>But I do not want to be distracted from talking about a very important bill. Let us be very clear. This is a very important topic and I do acknowledge that the Labor government appreciates the importance of quality child care and education in this country and of supporting Australian families. We intend to provide Australian families with access to affordable, accessible and quality early education and child care. The Labor government has committed $18.2 billion over the next four years to achieve this. That is about $11 billion more than the Howard government spent in these critical areas over the last four years of its government. Senator Nash did not reflect on that, I note. Eight hundred thousand Australian families have benefited from the government’s funding, from its 2007 commitments to assist with covering 50 per cent of out-of-pocket expenses for child care. That compares with the Howard government’s covering of only 30 per cent of those out-of-pocket expenses. As an example, in 2004 the out-of-pocket expenses after subsidies for a family with one child in long day care, and earning $55,000 a year, were 13 per cent of disposable income. In 2010, this proportion had declined to seven per cent. That is a significant change, approaching a 50 per cent reduction in the out-of-pocket expenses.</para>
<para>When I speak about child care, I speak about it from a long time ago when my children were in child care and family day care, but now, in more recent times, my beautiful grandchildren are in occasional care and one has spent a significant amount of time in child care. As well as that, I have a daughter who worked in the industry. So I speak with some knowledge on this important area.</para>
<para>In addition to the childcare rebates, $8.4 billion is provided to low- and middle-income earners in childcare benefits. Unlike the Howard government, who forced parents to wait until the end of each financial year to recover their rebates—after it had no doubt pocketed the interest from that—we have already moved to pay benefits quarterly, and from 1 July 2011 parents will be able to choose to receive their childcare rebates fortnightly. That is when the costs are incurred. Parents will not have to bear that cost for 12 months, with the associated stress that comes with that. This is a benefit for all Australian families. The childcare rebate has risen to a maximum of $7,500 per year or more than $145 per week. The maximum under the previous coalition government was $4,354, which is a difference of $3,146 per year or more than $60 a week—in other words, 72 per cent less than is now available.</para>
<para>The message should be starting to become very clear: child care and early childcare education is something that this government is taking very seriously. Adequate funding is only part of the picture. Parents need to have peace of mind that their children are safe, happy and in a simulating environment. There are numerous international studies that confirm the link: if you invest early in high-quality education and child care, children have better outcomes at school and in the rest of their lives. International studies include the Perry Preschool Project, a longitudinal study which commenced in 1962. For many years we have seen evidence that confirms these links. Another example is the Chicago child-parent centres study, which shows significant benefits:</para>
<quote>
<para class="block">… the effects of the Child-Parent Center and Expansion (CPC) Program on scholastic development up to age 14 were reported for a large sample of economically disadvantaged children … participation in extended childhood intervention to second and third grade yielded significantly better school performance than participation ending in kindergarten, and … longer-term effects of the program were largely explained by cognitive-advantage and family-support factors …</para>
</quote>
<para class="block">In England the Effective Provision of Pre-School Education, EPPE, project investigated the effects of preschool education and care on children’s development for children aged three to seven years. Three thousand children were tracked between 1997 and 2004. A sample of home based children, who had no or minimal preschool experience, was recruited to the study at entry to school for comparison with the preschool group. Again, the study confirmed the enormous benefit of early childhood intervention. These benefits have also been identified with disabled children—the earlier the intervention, the better the outcome is likely to be. It is not just international studies that show us this. Australians such as Fiona Stanley and Alison Elliott have been telling us that the early years shape the future happiness, future health and future wellbeing of children.</para>
<para>Many childcare centres across Australia are doing well. However, the National Childcare Accreditation Council’s latest report shows that, sadly, too many childcare centres are failing to meet basic safety, hygiene, educational and wellbeing standards. The report shows us that, of the 1,129 centres that received an accreditation decision between 1 January and 30 June, 30 per cent failed to ensure that toileting and nappy-changing procedures were consistent with advice from recognised health authorities; 26 per cent failed to ensure each child’s learning was documented and used in a planning program; 34 per cent failed to ensure that staff members supported each child’s needs for rest, sleep, comfort and sun protection; and 32 per cent failed to ensure that potentially dangerous products, plants and objects were inaccessible to children. This must be improved, and the Labor government, the Gillard government, is determined to do this. We are going to lift the standard of child care across Australia.</para>
<para>In conjunction with the state and territory governments through the National Quality Standard, we will improve staff-child ratios so that every child gets more individual care and attention; raise staff qualifications to ensure staff are better able to lead activities that help children learn and develop; introduce a quality ratings system for all childcare services so that parents know the quality of care on offer and can make more informed choices; and reduce red tape related to services so that providers only have to deal with one regulator and can spend less time on paperwork and more time with the kids in their care. This essential work will be achieved by pausing the indexation of the childcare rebate. The cap of $7,500 will remain in place until 30 June 2014. Remember the Howard government’s cap of $4,353. Today, a family earning $80,000 per year with a child in full-time care will receive $2,239 more in childcare rebates than under the previous government. This will provide $86.3 million that will be directly re-invested in lifting the quality of care for our children.</para>
<para>In the 2010-2011 budget we announced $273.7 million to support the introduction of the National Quality Framework for Early Childhood Education and Care. In particular, $59.4 million will be invested in 142 budget based, funded early childhood services predominately located in rural and remote Australia, which will provide care for some of our most vulnerable children. I am sure Senator Nash will make note of that. This budget provision means that less than three per cent of families will be affected by the deferral of indexation and less than one per cent, in fact 0.67 per cent, of families whose income is less than $100,000 will be affected. For this level of childcare rebate to be reached, families would need to have their child accessing care for at least 10 hours per day at the average cost levels. The average childcare rebate is estimated to be $2,300 per year, well below the $7,500.</para>
<para>The Australian Early Development Index suggests that 23.5 per cent of all Australian children are vulnerable in at least one of the domains assessed by this index. The index looks at issues such as physical health and wellbeing, social competence, emotional maturity, language and cognitive skills—</para>

<para>—I rise on a matter of public interest at a time when Palestinians are still being denied their fundamental human rights, including the right of self-determination. The need for justice and self-determination in Palestine is important not only for Palestinians but for global security and all peace-loving Australians. Recent events in Tunisia and Egypt serve to remind us that people’s desire for democracy, justice and self-determination is universal. There can never be a case for the oppression of a people on the basis that it is simply their destiny to be oppressed and thus they should accept it as their fate. Yet this is essentially the position of those—and there are many—who attempt to justify the status quo in relations between Israel and the Palestinians.</para>
</talk.start>
<para>The Palestinian people are well within their rights to advocate their cause far and wide, whether that is at the United Nations, in the offices of members and senators of this parliament or in public halls and meeting rooms around the world. The injustices inflicted on Palestinians in the occupied territories are constant, persistent and degrading beyond the tolerance of any decent person.</para>
<para>This is not a right versus left political issue. For too long the protagonists in the Middle East conflict have corralled everyone else into opposing camps according to an imagined world where the political right reflexively supports Israel and the political left reflexively supports the Palestinians. While this approach has served the shallow ends of those who have an interest in perpetuating the conflict, the need for a lasting Middle East peace demands that we defy those who have an interest in perpetuating conflict and instead focus on the humanitarian and security benefits of peace.</para>
<para>Among recent documentation of the plight of Palestinians in Gaza is the report by the British-Palestine All Party Parliamentary Group entitled <inline font-style="italic">The world’s largest prison camp: a report on access to Gaza</inline>. A delegation comprising Conservative, Labour and Liberal Democrat MPs from the group visited Gaza in October 2010 and was hosted by the United Nations Relief and Works Agency. The delegation notes that the 2008 invasion by Israeli forces under the codenamed Operation Cast Lead resulted in widespread attacks upon the civilian infrastructure of Gaza. Hospitals, schools, mosques, civilian homes and the UN compound were severely damaged or destroyed. Thirteen hundred Palestinians were killed, the majority of them civilians, including 352 children—an appalling loss of innocent lives. Another 5,000 were wounded.</para>
<para>The United Nations Relief and Works Agency reports that 3,540 houses were destroyed during Operation Cast Lead, with a further 2,866 sustaining major damage, while 52,900 homes sustained minor damage. The UN report into the operation concluded that both Israeli and Palestinian combatants had committed war crimes in the course of the fighting. The report found that Israel used disproportionate force and that the object of the operation was to inflict collective punishment against the civilian population of Gaza.</para>
<para>Two years on, reconstruction of the Gaza strip is prevented by Israel’s blockade of the territory. In May 2010, Israel announced it was easing the blockade of Gaza. While previously banned food supplies are now permitted to enter Gaza, the quantity of food available is still insufficient and remains well below pre-blockade levels. Construction materials and fuel remain barred for private use and only since September 2010 has the United Nations Relief and Works Agency received approval to import materials for reconstruction projects. These projects include four schools, 16 classrooms, two health centres, 21 housing units and a kindergarten. The construction sector is critical to restarting the economy of Gaza. Prior to the blockade, there were over 35,000 people employed in the construction sector in Gaza. Late last year the figure was estimated at 6,000. Reconstruction is central to alleviating the cripplingly high levels of unemployment in Gaza. Around 20 per cent of the budget of the Palestinian Ministry of Health goes towards paying the bills of Palestinians being treated abroad because of the unavailability of many treatments in the Palestinian territory.</para>
<para>It is perhaps not well understood but residents of Gaza are required to apply to the Israeli authorities for a permit to leave Gaza, even when the applicant does not wish to travel to Israel. It is no wonder that Gaza is referred to as the world’s largest prison camp. Israel’s justification for this policy is that it will weaken Hamas. That it has failed to do so and has merely served to inflict illegal collective punishment on Palestinian civilians has escaped their attention. Between January 2008 and June 2009, the Israeli authorities either refused or delayed 40 per cent of the applications for permits to leave Gaza for medical treatment. Palestinian doctors told the British parliamentary delegation of a systematic ‘de-development’ of the healthcare system in Gaza resulting from restrictions Israel had imposed on drugs, medical equipment and training of medical personnel overseas.</para>
<para>Construction materials necessary for reconstruction in Gaza must be allowed into the territory. Claims by Israel that Hamas would use the materials entering Gaza for military purposes are false. Hamas is able to obtain all the materials it wants through the network of smuggling tunnels under the Egyptian border. What is more, Hamas is able to bolster its own standing with Palestinians by launching building projects with smuggled materials while projects funded by the UN stand idle.</para>
<para>The British parliamentary delegation reported that, in their discussions with Fatah and Hamas, the factions indicated that agreement had been reached on the voting system for new elections to the Palestinian Legislative Council. While agreement on a range of other crucial matters has not been reached there appears to be an acceptance on both sides, including among elements of Hamas, that factional division is undermining the Palestinian cause. Israel has a clear responsibility to contribute to restoring stability and dignity to Gaza and dignity for the aspirations of the Palestinian people. The borders of Gaza must be reopened and the remaining elements of the Israeli blockade lifted. Exports and the free movement of Palestinian people must be allowed to resume. Engagement between all Palestinian factions must continue and Fatah and Hamas must reach a unity agreement, because to fail to do so will have consequences for the Palestinian people too dire to contemplate.</para>
<para>In view of the capacity of Iran to take any opportunity to advance its own rank interests in the Middle East, coupled with similar aspirations of extremist groups scattered throughout the region, it is more urgent than ever to bring the Middle East peace negotiations to a successful conclusion. I endorse the sentiments the Minister for Foreign Affairs expressed in a recent speech in Athens, in which he reiterated the importance of a two-state solution: ‘an independent and secure Israeli state and an independent and secure Palestinian state’.</para>
<para>The elements of peace should include the 1967 borders, resolution of the question of the right of return of Palestinian refugees, settlement of the conflict over Jerusalem and all necessary security guarantees. I think it is essential that Australian politicians who are interested in peace in the Middle East should be calling for these things to be done. The need to achieve a just peace in Palestine and to neutralise the rallying points for extremists who bolster their standing on the back of the suffering of the Palestinian people far outweighs the false political divisions that have arisen over this conflict. Even the former Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Barak has said: ‘I imagine that if I were a Palestinian of the right age, I would, at some stage, have joined one of the terror organisations.’</para>
<para>In December last year at a forum in Israel, US Secretary of State Hillary Clinton said:</para>
<quote>
<para class="block">The conflict between Israel and the Palestinians and between Israel and Arab neighbors is a source of tension and an obstacle to prosperity and opportunity for all the people of the region. It denies the legitimate aspirations of the Palestinian people and it poses a threat to Israel’s future security. It is at odds also with the interests of the United States.</para>
</quote>
<para class="block">Secretary Clinton also said at the forum:</para>
<quote>
<para class="block">The lack of peace and the occupation that began in 1967 continue to deprive the Palestinian people of dignity and self-determination. This is unacceptable, and, ultimately, it too is unsustainable.</para>
</quote>
<para class="block">And in June 2009, in his Cairo address, President Obama said:</para>
<quote>
<para class="block">
<inline font-size="9pt">…</inline> Israelis must acknowledge that just as Israel’s right to exist cannot be denied, neither can Palestine’s.</para>
<para class="block">                …            …            …</para>
<para class="block">The only resolution is for the aspirations of both sides to be met through two states, where Israelis and Palestinians each live in peace and security.</para>
<para class="block">That is in Israel’s interest, Palestine’s interest, America’s interest, and the world’s interest.</para>
<para class="block">                …            …            …</para>
<para class="block">So let there be no doubt: The situation for the Palestinian people is intolerable. And America will not turn our backs on the legitimate Palestinian aspiration for dignity, opportunity, and a state of their own.</para>
</quote>
<para class="block">These are not the words of left-wing radicals. These are the words of leaders whose daily job involves grappling with the complexities of conflict in the Middle East. Faced with the realities of the conflict and its implications for the perpetuation of international terrorism and for global stability, they have concluded that the conflict must end. And it must end in justice for the Palestinian people and security for Israel. It is the only conclusion open to us; it is the only conclusion open to Australians. We must continue to play a role in bringing peace and justice to the Middle East because peace and justice in the Middle East means peace and justice worldwide. It means a diminution of terrorism, it means hope and dignity for Palestinians, who have been denied that hope and dignity, and it means security for Israelis, who have been denied security in the past. It is absolutely essential that the Australian parliament, Australian politicians and the Australian public play their part in bringing peace to the Middle East.</para>

<para>—I rise today to speak on local government, part of my shadow portfolio. It was very interesting during the last election: Australia saw a rise in the prominence of the role of local government, with people such as Campbell Newman, who did an incredible job in Brisbane; Donna Stewart, in my area; and Mayor Taylor, in Toowoomba. Local government has become one of the most prominent mechanisms for delivery of services, with local knowledge back to local people. It is the representation of people on the ground. It is the form of government closest to the people. It is the greatest reflection of where our nation has moved to and how it has developed that now we have certain geographic interests that are entirely different to the interests that were present in 1901. The people of North Queensland feel a great affinity for North Queensland. If you want to get on the wrong side of the people of the Gold Coast, talk about Brisbane. It is likewise with the people of western Queensland. New England wanted their own state in 1967, and Newcastle was included in the referendum to try and knock it out. In the Riverina the situation is similar. There are greater numbers of people living in the northern part of Western Australia, the Kimberley, than there were before. There are real distinct geographical relationships between areas that, in some instances, are more closely tied to their association with local government than they are tied to a state capital many, many miles away.</para>
</talk.start>
<para>As shadow minister for regional development, local government and water, I would like to take this opportunity to talk about a few issues pertaining to local government and to recognise the importance of this particular level of government. Local government in Australia is a dynamic and exceptionally diverse sector. There are over 500 councils throughout Australia, which range in size from Brisbane City Council, which is one of the largest in the world, with a population of around a million people, to the Jerilderie Shire Council in New South Wales, which has much smaller population of around 2,000. Local government is an exceptionally important level of government within Australia. It is local government that provides and maintains many of the essential services to our communities, through waste management, infrastructure maintenance and regional development, to name a few. The coalition is committed to building a new partnership between federal and local government across Australia. This partnership will recognise local government’s role as the jurisdiction closest to and most engaged with our local communities. The coalition is also dedicated to enhancing the Commonwealth’s direct financial relationship with local government. The coalition believes in continuing Commonwealth support to keep local government on a more sustainable financial footing and ensuring the states abide by their promise to avoid cost-shifting.</para>
<para>Financing for local government has been and will remain one of the principal challenges. If you do not have the resources, you will not be able to fix the transport, infrastructure and housing issues. It is always local government that can find you the cheapest way to do it, because of their knowledge on the ground of what they want, how to deliver it and how to get a good price for it. One of the other benefits of local government is, even if you have got a bad one, it does not operate the whole state; it just operates the section you are with—and you have a better chance of meeting local government members on the street and expressing your views clearly to them. A major challenge for local government is that the costs of maintaining what they are responsible for are increasing exponentially. For example, construction costs have been increasing at 10 per cent over the past three years. The rateable base for local government is clearly not going to match this pace. We need to make sure that we find alternative ways of maintaining the resources of local government.</para>
<para>The coalition remains a strong supporter of Commonwealth direct funding of local governments, and we will examine ways of strengthening the support that the Commonwealth can deliver to local governments. Since 2007 the federal Labor government has been strong on promises and weak on delivery to local government. Labor has no interest in genuine reform of federal-local relations. After the June 2010 meeting of the Australian Council of Local Government, which was really a talkfest between the Labor government and councils from across Australia, the Labor government failed to take action on key issues of concern that were raised by local government. The Labor Party has also failed to stop the erosion of local government planning powers by its state Labor colleagues. As a result, community involvement in development decisions continues to decline. This has resulted in increasing the development costs, with more oversight and more bureaucracy as people in state governments try to find themselves a job by putting more regulations on people they have never met before nor are likely to meet again in their lives.</para>
<para>The Labor Party has also failed to display long-term planning in its hasty school hall/flat screen/ceiling insulation stimulus package to local government. The Labor government has funded community assets with little thought as to how they will be maintained after stimulus payments are concluded. The Labor Party has also failed to stop its state Labor colleagues from cost-shifting at the expense of local government. The coalition successfully developed the intergovernmental agreement on cost-shifting that was signed in April 2006. Unfortunately, state governments continue to withdraw services, expecting local government to fill the gap, or to transfer state assets such as regional roads to local government and expect them to pick up the tab to manage them.</para>
<para>The coalition is committed to building a new partnership between federal and local government across Australia that recognises local government’s role as the jurisdiction closest to and most engaged with our local communities; enhances the Commonwealth’s direct financial relationships with local government; continues Commonwealth support to keep local government on a more sustainable financial footing and ensure the states abide by their promise to avoid cost-shifting; encourages improved professionalism in local government in such areas as governance, project delivery, financial and asset management and workforce planning as part of greater certainty in funding arrangements; supports the role of local government in the Council of Australian Governments, ministerial councils and cooperative planning with state and federal jurisdictions; recognises the capacity of local councils to be an alternative way to deliver Commonwealth funded initiatives; and supports efforts by local government to secure constitutional recognition and provide certainty regarding the powers of the Commonwealth to enter into direct financial relationships with local governments.</para>
<para>The coalition has a strong and impressive record of support for the delivery of services through local government. This includes direct federal funding to local government, now running at $2 billion per annum; establishment of infrastructure programs directly assisting the delivery of responsibilities partly or fully held by councils, such as Roads to Recovery and restoring the Black Spot Program; supporting local government communities with specific infrastructure initiatives such as the Sustainable Regions Program and the Regional Partnerships program, the latter funding more than 800 community projects across Australia; taking a stand against cost-shifting by the states and territories onto local government, commissioning the Hawker review and developing a new intergovernmental agreement; presenting a resolution in both houses of parliament to recognise local government’s integral role in the governance of Australia; and initiating a Productivity Commission study into local government’s revenue-raising capacity, providing a clearer understanding of the means by which local governments can raise their own revenue. If in power, the coalition will protect local government from cost-shifting by state governments, help councils deliver more efficient services and provide greater transparency in the use of taxpayer funds.</para>
<para>I would also like to take this opportunity to speak specifically, in more detail, about the goal of local government to gain constitutional recognition. As you may be aware, the Australian Local Government Association is currently working to achieve the inclusion of local government in the Australian Constitution. I praise the Australian Local Government Association for its hard work and persistence with regard to constitutional reform. Local government is currently not mentioned in the Australian Constitution. In general terms, state governments have sole responsibility for and authority over local government. Australia is yet to follow the lead of many other nations and recognise the roles and functions of local governments in our national Constitution.</para>
<para>The recent High Court decision in Pape v the Commissioner of Taxation 2009—and I have to admit that Pape, a member of my party, the National Party, certainly made things slightly more difficult with this one—has also put the need for constitutional change into sharper focus. The High Court decision in that case underlined the limitations of and uncertainties about the Commonwealth’s relationship with local government. The Commonwealth cannot spend money on whatever activities and objectives it likes. The judges’ commentary on the decision places some uncertainty over the basis for direct funding by the Commonwealth to local governments, such as Roads to Recovery, which is widely supported throughout so many areas of Australia. We know that people would want that program to be maintained. Another example is Labor’s Regional and Local Community Infrastructure Program. Constitutional reform will remove this uncertainty and protect these vital local government funding sources.</para>
<para>The coalition supports the direct Commonwealth funding of local government and proposed to expand Commonwealth funding through a $300 million investment in bridges at the last election. The coalition therefore supports the appropriate constitutional recognition of local government to remove uncertainty about the constitutionality of direct Commonwealth funding to local government. At times we hear that 45 per cent of funding that goes from the Commonwealth to local government is taken by the states as administrative charges. This cannot go on. We cannot have a leach between us and where the funding needs to be spent.</para>
<para>The Constitution can be changed only in the following manner. A bill must pass through the House of Representatives and the Senate by an absolute majority—that is, 50 per cent of all members of the House of Representatives and the Senate must approve the proposed constitutional amendment. Practically, this means that there can be no constitutional change without the support of the government of the day. The question must then go to a referendum. The Australian Labor Party went into the election with a platform commitment to constitutional recognition of local government. It promised:</para>
<quote>
<para class="block">An important aspect of reform of the federation is to recognise and make more efficient the work of the third tier: local government. Labor has committed to a Council of Australian Local Governments to assist local government representatives to have a more effective voice at COAG. One of the first tasks of the new Council will be to develop a plan for a national referendum on the constitutional recognition of local government.</para>
</quote>
<para class="block">That was Bob McMullan in a federation reform program media statement of 6 September 2007.</para>
<para>It appears that there is bipartisan support for this reform. We need to develop a proposal for constitutional change that has broad support from government and the community, but it could involve as little a change as adding the words ‘and local government’ to section 96 of the Constitution so that it will read: ‘During a period of 10 years after the establishment of the Commonwealth and thereafter until the parliament otherwise provides, the parliament may grant financial assistance to any state and local government on such terms and conditions as the parliament thinks fit.’</para>
<para>As the closest form of government to the people, local government is a crucial element of Australia’s government structure. Many government programs could be delivered better if politicians listened more to the local knowledge and expertise that resides in local government. Recognition is essential to ensure that local governments can continue to deliver their vital services to each and every community across Australia. Therefore, the coalition is supportive of constitutional recognition of local government. Nonetheless, I note that a referendum on local government has failed twice already. It is important that the local government sector develop a detailed proposal which has widespread support. Ultimately, it does not matter what I say or what the coalition says. We need the people to support it for the referendum to succeed.</para>
<para>In the past 15 years we have seen more and more government responsibilities centralised in Canberra. This has been an understandable response to the failures of state governments, but Canberra cannot make all the decisions. If we do not make this change to recognise local government, we will just see the continuation of powers going from the states to Canberra, never to be seen again. We must start working on the diminution of this power and the movement of power back to the people, back to local government. For that to be able to happen, there must be a capacity for a conduit of funds from the federal government to local government.</para>
<para>Where local governments are such an important conduit is the on-the-ground concerns of everyday Australians. We need to respond to these concerns. We also need to understand that this is something they always talk about. Even this morning, they talked about issues in which they can look for bipartisan support. It was interesting to hear Mr Hawke and Mr Howard in a seminar that they gave after they had both left parliament. They were asked, ‘Is there one thing you could agree on?’ and this was something they could both agree on. Something they both said was, ‘If we had our time again, we would not be putting the lines on the map where we put them.’</para>
<para>This is a reality of where Australia is. The people of North Queensland want a greater association with Townsville, and we should be allowing them to do that. The people of the far north want a greater association with Cairns, and we should be allowing them to do that. The people of the Gold Coast want a greater association with the Gold Coast that does not necessarily come via Brisbane, and we should be allowing them to do that. The people of Tamworth want an association with Tamworth that does not come via Sydney, and the people of Wagga want an association with the Riverina that does not come via Sydney. I imagine it is the same in so many other areas. It is not a matter of removing the states; it is a matter of recognising that certain areas in the north of Queensland—such as Townsville, where there are 180,000 people, and Cairns, where there are 130,000-plus people—are completely different places than they were in 1901. For us to give those people this liberty and a capacity to express their desires in the form of government closest to them, we have to allow that form of government access to the funds to do it.</para>

<para>—I rise to speak about the fallout from the oil spill in the Timor Sea—the PTTEP and Montara spill—the need for ongoing improvement in our oil and gas regulations and concerns I have around the granting of further leases before the improvements that have been promised by the government to our regulations have been made. In November last year the government released the commission of inquiry report into the Montara oil spill of the year before. They also released the government response to the commission of inquiry. Many of the recommendations the government have picked up and they have made a number of commitments. One of those was that they would ensure that there was an independent review of PTTEP Australasia’s action plan about how they would improve their operations and the management of their operations in Australian waters. The government said that they would commission an independent review of that action plan. This was in response to the recommendation of the commission of inquiry report that in fact PTTEP should be forced by the government to show cause as to why their leases should not be resumed. The government undertook to release that independent review within seven days of receiving it and they anticipated that would be before the end of the year or early in the new year. In fact the government released the review, as I understand it, within seven days of them having received it just at the end of last week, last Friday.</para>
</talk.start>
<para>The report of the independent review is quite a comprehensive document. It makes some very strong statements on the significant and sweeping changes in governance and oilfield practice that PTTEP needs to make to reach the kind of safety and risk management standards that the community expects if it is to operate in Australian waters. In doing so it has reinforced the findings of the Montara commission of inquiry, which found conclusively that the widespread and systemic shortcomings in PTTEP’s governance and procedures were a direct cause of the Montara disaster. The report suggests that if PTTEP complies precisely with the Montara action plan then it can meet industry best practice standards in all of its Australian and Australasian operations. But that is a big if, and the report was really clear on that. The report concludes that the success of this program of cultural and practice change will depend entirely on the quality of its execution, and it bolded that statement in its report.</para>
<para>The government in response to this said that they would put in place an 18-month monitoring plan to ensure that the plan was being implemented. As I understand it, they are saying that that monitoring plan will be comprehensive. It is critical that this monitoring plan is done properly and it is critical that it is intensive and comprehensive. The reporting from the monitoring plan we believe needs to be made publicly available and if PTTEP is not sticking to its action plan the government should not wait 18 months to take any action necessary to resume those leases.</para>
<para>I continue to have reservations about PTTEP being allowed to operate in Australian waters given the findings of the Montara inquiry. We will continue to pursue this issue. We will continue to pursue the monitoring plan and in fact I will be putting to government that the monitoring needs to be done at least once a month and that those monitoring plans must be released through parliament and tabled in parliament so that the public can be absolutely assured that this company is meeting every requirement of its action plan. We note that the independent review concludes that until the action plan is completed and fully implemented questions remain about whether PTTEP will be effective in meeting industry standards for good governance and good oilfield practice. This means it has to complete the action plan before it is operating at the kind of standard the Australian community rightfully expects for it to be able to tap our shared oil and gas resources. This is why the report stresses that ongoing government oversight will be critical to ensure PTTEP’s compliance with the action plan.</para>
<para>We believe that until PTTEP has fully complied with and completed the action plan and very clearly demonstrated it has achieved industry best practice in governance and oilfield practice it should not be granted any additional licences to establish any new operations in Australian waters. What this independent review says is that PTTEP is not there yet; it has to implement its action plan. In other words, it has not yet met industry best practice. It has not demonstrated it can meet that. It has now demonstrated it can write an action plan but not that it has been implemented yet. So we question why the government thinks it would be acceptable to grant this company more licences in Australian waters when it is yet to demonstrate it can meet industry best practice.</para>
<para>We note in the independent review report that was released last Friday that it took PTTEP two goes to develop an appropriate action plan. Its first action plan focused entirely on technical issues without addressing the many systemic and governance issues that led directly to the Montara disaster, which is clearly pointed out in the review. We are concerned that that again highlights the fact that PTTEP needs to demonstrate it can improve both its technical performance and its governance performance in a sustained manner. We note that PTTEP will be required to sign a binding agreement to implement the action plan if it is not asked to show cause as to why it should not have its leases taken off it, enabling it to continue in Australian waters. We believe that the minister should be able to issue a show cause notice at any time if this company fails to meet the milestones in its action plan.</para>
<para>The independent review also makes a number of important recommendations concerning the offshore petroleum industry as a whole. One message that came through to me during this entire Montara disaster and the subsequent inquiry was that PTTEP was unlikely to be the only offshore operator which was cutting corners on good governance, environmental risk and worker safety, that there have been a number of near misses in the past and that stronger regulation to achieve better governance and oilfield practices is required right across the industry. I note this has been acknowledged by government. To this end, we will continue to pursue this better regulatory practice to put in place a world-class regulatory regime to ensure that all companies operating off our shores comply with the highest standards of safety and risk management. We believe that there is a significant cultural change required across the offshore oil and gas industry to ensure the safety of our workers and the protection of our precious environment.</para>
<para>That brings me to the issue of the granting of new licences during January—licences that were granted to BP, the company that was responsible for the disastrous oil spill in the Gulf of Mexico from the Deepwater Horizon well. That incident was eerily the same as the Montara disaster. This company has been granted four leases in the frontier area in the Ceduna Sub-basin, which is within the Great Australian Bight, off the South Australian coast. It has been granted leases over 24,000 kilometres of the Great Australian Bight in water that is three times deeper than the Deepwater Horizon well—4,500 metres. No matter what safety measures are put in place, deep-sea drilling is incredibly risky. I will go into that in a bit more detail later and provide some findings of the inquiry into that particular disaster.</para>
<para>This area is a key feeding, breeding and migratory site for a number of threatened species. It also happens to cover a large area of the Great Australian Bight Marine Park. These are important areas for the southern right whale, the humpback whale, the great white shark and the southern bluefin tuna, to mention but a few. And the minister says, ‘It’s okay—we’ve put some extra conditions on BP.’ But BP have not clearly demonstrated that they have addressed the very significant issues that were raised by that gigantic disaster in the Gulf of Mexico.</para>
<para>When you look at the findings of the National Commission on the BP Deepwater Horizon Oil Spill and Offshore Drilling report it makes very scary reading. I will say again that many of the findings and recommendations of the US inquiry mirror many of the findings of the Montara inquiry. The following is a conclusion in chapter 4 of the very extensive commission of inquiry findings on the Deepwater Horizon spill; it relates to deepwater drilling:</para>
<quote>
<para class="block">… it is an inherently risky business given the enormous pressures and geologic uncertainties present in the formations where oil and gas are found—thousands of feet below the ocean floor. Notwithstanding those inherent risks, the accident of April 20 was avoidable. It resulted from clear mistakes made in the first instance by BP, Halliburton—</para>
</quote>
<para class="block">as an aside, I understand that Halliburton does around 50 per cent of the cementing-in of wells in Australia, so they are a significant player in our industry here in Australia—</para>
<quote>
<para class="block">and Transocean, and by government officials who, relying too much on industry’s assertions of the safety of their operations, failed to create and apply a program of regulatory oversight that would have properly minimized the risks of deepwater drilling. It is now clear that both industry and government need to reassess and change business practices to minimize the risks of such drilling.</para>
</quote>
<para class="block">William Reilly, who was the chair of that inquiry, also made a number of very significant comments, one of which was:</para>
<quote>
<para class="block">To my shock it quickly became clear that while the industry has devoted billions to the technologies required for deepwater drilling it has devoted essentially nothing to creating a plan B to deal with the utterly foreseeable consequences of a major spill. Neither has the government.</para>
</quote>
<para class="block">Mr Reilly has also been quoted on a number of occasions outlining his concerns about what happened in the lead-up to that spill. He is quoted as saying:</para>
<quote>
<para class="block">They have uncovered a culture of complacency, cost-cutting and systematic failures and companies were unprepared to deal with accidents and their consequences.</para>
</quote>
<para class="block">The report outlines the systemic failures that occurred not only in industry but in government. Those failings need to be addressed. The failings by BP need to be addressed. Where has it been demonstrated to the Australian community—in fact to the world community, because this company is an international one—that this company has addressed the major failings that have been identified in its operations in the Gulf of Mexico? We have to bear in mind that these new wells in Australian waters will be three times the depth of that well in the Gulf of Mexico.</para>
<para>The minister has put some additional conditions on the company, but we are yet to see how they are overcoming these systemic failures. At least PTTEP has been required to develop a comprehensive action plan, which the government is going to be monitoring for an 18-month period of time to ensure that the company can manage its existing operations. Here we have a company whose actions and systemic failures have led to the biggest oil spill, with disastrous consequences. It has taken lives and its social, economic and environmental impacts are untold. That company has been granted leases in our waters before it has been required to demonstrate it can meet industry standards in the same way that PTTEP has been required to demonstrate that it can now meet those standards, and it will be monitored for the next 18 months. BP has not done that.</para>
<para>Nor do we have the government’s promised amendments to oil and gas regulation. We do not yet have in place the single national regulator. At the same time, we have the Western Australian government saying it will not sign up to it; it does not support it. So how can we be granting a company that has not yet demonstrated that it can manage its operations in deep water four leases in Australian waters? That is not adequate management of our oil and gas industry. It is not industry best practice. We expect better from this government in protecting our marine environment. <inline font-style="italic">(Time expired)</inline>

<para>—On 19 February 1942, Darwin was bombed, culminating in the death of 251 people. Although it remains one of the largest losses of life arising from a single event in Australia’s history, we still fail each year to acknowledge this catastrophic loss on a national scale. This event deserves its own national day of recognition and acknowledgement and today I am calling on the federal government and respective governments around this nation to finally acknowledge and commemorate what happened to Darwin and to this country on that day. Unlike Anzac Day and Remembrance Day, which form important parts of our yearly military commemorations, the Darwin bombings remain an equally important yet forgotten date on our nation’s calendar.</para>
</talk.start>
<para>As the largest Japanese attack after Pearl Harbor, the bombing of Darwin marks an important part of Australia’s character. It signifies many of the values we find in the Anzac spirit, such as mateship and camaraderie. But, unlike Anzac Day, the Darwin bombings mark a time when the very remote possibility of war on Australian soil became a horrifying reality. Rather than hearing reports of Australians fighting abroad, Australians at the time of the Darwin bombings witnessed the devastating realities of war on our home soil. With the arrival of aircraft in battle, Australia’s defences were no longer concerned with maritime protection. The age of aircraft had arrived and the final and stark reality that we could be bombed from the air became a poignant point at that time in this nation’s history.</para>
<para>Suddenly, Australia was fighting for her life. Too often commentators point out problems with the defence but, contrary to what they say, our people, together with their American counterparts, fought bravely and well as anti-aircraft sites, machine guns and ships managed to withstand the wave upon wave of Japanese aircraft. The people who lost their lives that day helped fight off a totalitarian regime keen to expand its imperial march from Papua New Guinea. Since early European settlement, this was the first time Australia had been attacked by a foreign enemy, emphasising just how significant these attacks were within the context of the war in the Pacific. It helped strengthen Australia’s national character and underpinned our important relationship with the United States and between the servicemen from both nations—those who worked together to defend the city on that day.</para>
<para>As is the case with so many of these tragedies, the resulting personal stories are often the most powerful aspect. So it was with much interest that I read about the doctor who, in the midst of his efforts to help injured military personnel at the Darwin Hospital, noticed the Japanese bombers on the horizon. Darwin Hospital was one of the sites bombed by the Japanese that day. The doctor immediately alerted all he could in the hospital and tried to defend it as best he could against the incoming raid. Because some Royal Australian Air Force planes had recently left Darwin, it was assumed that those planes on the horizon were the same planes returning to base. Since the doctor had had extensive work at sea with the Royal Australian Navy, he immediately recognised that the planes were not friendly at all but rather Japanese imperial bombers. All too recently, there was an eloquent and accurate reconstruction of the early scenes of the bombing of Darwin, as seen by the Catholic priests and the Indigenous communities of the Tiwi islands, in the film <inline font-style="italic">Australia</inline> in which Nicole Kidman and Hugh Jackman starred.</para>
<para>In an attack that bore all the hallmarks of the attack on Pearl Harbor only two months earlier, no adequate warning was received throughout Darwin. The city was not in any position to defend itself significantly and its citizens were not in any meaningful position to respond at such short notice. Despite this incredibly short notice, however, the nursing staff scrambled to help the sick and the dying as best they could. Medical staff continued to render assistance while the Japanese continued to bomb not only naval and merchant ships in the harbour but also vital civic institutions such as the hospital. This included the now famous bombing of the Darwin Post Office, parts of which—a wall—have been reconstructed in the Northern Territory Parliament House. When civilian institutions such as these were bombed in the devastating raids on Darwin, we were reminded of the proximity of World War II and how it had not only come to the Pacific but had finally reached Australian soil. It served as a stark reminder to us all that warfare, as early as the 1940s, was no longer a vague concept that somehow implicated us remotely through our Commonwealth membership and the Anzac alliance. Suddenly, Australia was actually experiencing firsthand the cost, the shock and the tragedy of war.</para>
<para>Once the dust had settled and the city could take stock of the bombings, it provided some opportunity for the city to renew and transform itself into what the administrator of the time, Mr Charles Aubrey Abbott, called a ‘modern tropical city’. Unlike the Leader of the Opposition, this Mr Abbott had a vision for his city and country. He commenced reconstruction work without delay and provided some real, meaningful leadership towards the reconstruction efforts of Darwin. To this very day, Darwin remains a multicultural, dynamic and modern tropical city. Every year, the Darwin City Council and the Northern Territory government, together with the Australian Defence Force, make a significant effort to commemorate the bombings with flyovers, ceremonies and speeches. Every effort is made to welcome back the veterans from those bombings and to ensure that their stories are treasured and retold and become part of the curriculum, at least in the Northern Territory.</para>
<para>I am pleased also to note that, thanks to the lobbying efforts of the Northern Territory government and in particular Paul Henderson, the Chief Minister, the bombing of Darwin will now become part of the new national curriculum. But I think there is a need to take it one step further. Within Darwin there is significant media coverage of the event, but I continue to be disappointed by the lack of coverage undertaken in the rest of the country. The Darwin bombings mark a significant moment in our nation’s history, particularly our military history. They were the first time in our nation’s history that Australian soil was under attack. The bombings serve as a reminder to us all that not only does warfare know no bounds but Australia is subject to attack just like any other island nation. The bombings remind us of our relationship with the United States, which is as longstanding as it is strong. They mark a moment in time when Australia came of age as a country and defended itself independently of the United Kingdom.</para>
<para>It is also true that during that time members of the maritime workers union, who were on the wharf that day, were the subject of these bombing attacks, and every year on the anniversary of the bombing of Darwin the Maritime Union of Australia take the opportunity to commemorate their members and workers who lost their lives on that day.</para>
<para>Today I am advocating that, commencing this year, on Saturday week, we have a national day of recognition of the bombings of Darwin—a national day when we all stop for one minute, just like on Anzac Day and Remembrance Day, and remember the efforts of people in Darwin, the lives that were lost and the significance for our country if that attack had not been stopped. I believe a moment of silence across the nation will increase public awareness of the attacks and heighten Australians’ awareness of their connection to, rather than isolation from, the rest of the world. Further, a moment to reflect on the bombings would provide us all with the opportunity to reflect on how far our Australian character has come. Most importantly, a moment of silence will allow us to remember those who fell on that day, who died on Australian soil defending this country from an enemy attack. It will allow us to remember those American servicemen who died helping to defend our city and the civilians who died—the deaths that are a consequence when such an attack occurs during war. The remembrance of those who fell will help Australians appreciate not only what our defence forces did during that time but also our close and longstanding relationship with America and the values we mutually share and defend. It may also help Australians appreciate the connection we now have with the Japanese—the bridges that have been built and the relationships that have developed and strengthened since that time.</para>
<para>As the story of the doctor shows—and as does the diary I have read of a little boy who recounted his memories of the Darwin attacks—it was not just one day; it was sustained over weeks and months. It was not just one bombing attack; it was tens of dozens of attacks. The significance and the enormity of the attacks—the number of times and their length—I think is something that very few Australians know about. I think very few Australians appreciate what actually occurred in the Top End of Australia on 19 February 1942. Very few Australians will stop for one minute on Saturday week and remember the devastation that was wreaked upon our country during those bombings.</para>
<para>Australians historically have been of sympathetic and courageous character. A moment of silence for the Darwin bombings is not intended to rival Anzac Day, is not intended to rival Remembrance Day but is intended to complement and augment these services, because they each tell a particular and special story about Australia’s military history—about our survival and the efforts of our defence forces and civilians to maintain and protect the democracy that we so value. But this time it was on our own soil, our very own turf. It is time that this nation recognised that in a national day of commemoration.</para>
<para>Each of these stories tells a particular chapter of Australia’s history—its colonial underpinnings, its independence—and it charts the story of our friends and foes, past and present. Commemorating the bombing of Darwin each year, nationally and for one minute on that day—like we do on the other two days of significance during the year, Anzac Day and Remembrance Day—will help to educate our future generations about our past and honour those who have contributed to our history. It will also ensure that the events of that day are not lost; that they become part of our culture and part of us. It will ensure we finally recognise the significant devastation but also the skill employed that day to ensure the attacks on Darwin during World War II were simply that, and that at the end of the day, as a nation, we defeated that enemy. We should be proud to recognise that each and every year, as a nation.</para>

<para>—I rise to speak about a forthcoming date: 26 March, the date of the state election in New South Wales. It will be of real interest to see how that election pans out on the day.</para>
</talk.start>
<para>In 1995 the Carr Labor government was elected in New South Wales. Bob Carr made the promise that it would be the greenest government the state would ever see. Of course it would be—that was the influence of the Greens back in those days. Bob Carr needed the support of the Greens in the Legislative Council, the upper house. What did8 he do? He followed the ‘build national parks all over the state’ theory, which I think is so, so wrong.</para>
<para>As I have said before in this place: you lock up country and you leave it, the grass grows, the fuel develops, lightning strikes and it burns and is destroyed. But people think this is conservation. I think it is a disgrace. We have now got all these national parks right across New South Wales, even at Pilliga, up in the northern areas near Moree, Narrabri and Coonabarabran, which I have travelled through many times. Now we have even got them saying the red gum forest down at Deniliquin in the Murray area has been locked up in a national park. Madam Acting Deputy President, I can assure you red gum cannot stand fire. If you burn the forests in the Pilliga of box and ironbark timbers, they will suck it back, but once red gum is burned it is destroyed. You can even go down to the forest at Deniliquin and have a look at the 900 hectares that has been burnt and is now destroyed. The locals wanted to cut the timber down after the fire. They had roughly 12 months to do so before the timber would split. No, the greenies would not let them cut it down. They said, ‘Okay, can we cut it down now for firewood’—this fire was several years ago—‘and let another forest grow?’ ‘No, you can’t cut it down for firewood.’ Believe me, now that it is locked up—thanks to Frank Sartor and the New South Wales government—and because they will not allow grazing in that national park now to keep the fuel levels down, the day will come when that forest will burn. It will be destroyed. The fire will destroy the trees, the red gums, and the environment for the animals and we will be able to thank Frank Sartor and the influence of the greens for destroying that forest.</para>
<para>Bob Carr, when elected in 1995, said he would halve the waiting queues for elective surgery and if he did not do that within 12 months he would resign. Well, you can fudge the figures and do what you like, but I think he did get there somehow and kept his job. But what did he do to the health system? For years, in fact for decades, we had local volunteers on our hospital boards and then they formed the district hospital boards and our local people managed our hospitals. Volunteers, doctors, nurses, accountants and solicitors managed it well. But, no, Bob Carr brought in these huge areas, to the detriment of our local hospitals. We even saw the case with the Greater Western Area Health Service a couple of years ago whereby they could not pay their bills. They could not pay the local butchers who supplied meat to the hospital. I had many small businesses complain to me about how the area health services would not pay their bills on time and small businesses had to carry their credit. It was a disgrace.</para>
<para>Let us look at what the Carr government of New South Wales did effectively. One thing they were very effective at was driving people out of New South Wales with high taxes and high stamp duty upping the cost of living and upping the cost of doing business. We had people moving out of New South Wales, mainly to Queensland, so much so that just prior to the 2007 election—when New South Wales had 50 federal seats and Queensland had 28—we had the seat of Gwydir taken off New South Wales. We went down to 49 and Queensland went up to 29 when the seat of Flynn was formed. Come the 2010 election and it was the same thing again: people were leaving New South Wales in droves and we had another seat taken out of New South Wales, which took us down to 48, while Queensland went up to 30 when the seat of Wright was formed. That was the effect of the Labor government in New South Wales. With their policies, their costs and their red tape they drove people out of our state. The first state and the once-great state has now been brought down because of the Labor governments over that time.</para>
<para>Let us have a look at some of their record, which I call New South Wales Labor’s rollcall of shame. Let us take the Premiers. Morris Iemma was forced out in Labor’s ambush on 8 September. He went into the room to clean a few out but they cleaned him out. Nathan Rees didn’t need to keep looking over his shoulder as faceless men like Joe Tripodi and Eddie Obeid shafted him for their puppet, Kristina Keneally. Let us have a look at the ministers. Treasurer Michael Costa was dumped by Nathan Rees and then resigned after telling the truth. Michael Costa said that New South Wales was heading for financial pain and needed a minibudget—off he went. Aboriginal affairs minister Milton Orkopoulos was arrested on child-sex and drug charges and sentenced to 13 years and 11 months in jail—and this was one of the community leaders, being a minister in a government. Ian Macdonald, known universally as Sir Lunchalot, resigned as state development minister over travel expense claims. Reba Meagher, the health minister who presided over a failing health system, was shown the door and then pulled the pin altogether. The next health minister, John Della Bosca, resigned over a sex scandal. Mr Della Bosca snubbed the small town of Tingha near Inverell, where I live, in July 2009 when he was supposed to fly up and open their new MPS hospital—and they are still waiting for him. There are plenty of suggestions as to what he was actually doing at the time, but we will not go too far there. He also snubbed the Armidale doctors who wanted to talk about the government’s response to the Garling report.</para>
<para>Transport minister David Campbell was caught by the media leaving a gay club in his official car, so out he went. Paul McLeay, the Minister for Minerals and Forest Resources, admitted to using a parliamentary computer to visit gambling and adult websites, so he was soon on his bike. Juvenile justice minister Graham West went against the grain: there was no scandal about the end of his career. He had just had enough of not getting enough funding for his portfolio and left. Environment minister Frank Sartor called it quits in December last year. As I said, this is the man who will be responsible for the destruction of the red gum forests in the south of our state.</para>
<para>Let us have a look at the rorting. The member for Penrith, Karen Paluzzano, lied to ICAC and Premier Keneally about corrupt activities in her electoral office. That handed the seat to the Liberals. Who is on the nose? Well, former ports minister Joe Tripodi announced late last year he is going. It is not just the people of New South Wales who are saying good riddance; most of the state Labor people are saying the same. Now we have the drugs issue. The husband of education minister Verity Firth is caught buying an ecstasy tablet. Then we have the infamous party involving Matt Brown, who was the police minister, and the member for Wollongong, Noreen Hay. It must have been some sort of show better suited for somewhere like Kings Cross.</para>
<para>Let me quote what the <inline font-style="italic">Illawarra Mercury</inline> editorial said on 2 September 2010 under the headline ‘Another nail in the coffin for NSW Government’:</para>
<quote>
<para class="block">What is it about politicians who cannot keep their pants on?</para>

</quote>
<para class="block">Now 22 members of the Labor Party in the New South Wales parliament have announced their resignations.</para>
<para>I want to take you, Madam Acting Deputy President, to some of the waste of this government. The Auditor-General says the Keneally government was wasting $778 million a year. I repeat: $778 million a year. That is $2 million a day. Premier Keneally poured $356 million down the drain on the abandoned CBD metro. There was a $188 million overspend on Building the Education Revolution—surprise, surprise; $150 million lost on the sale of the New South Wales lotteries; $10 million flushed down the toilet by Minister Macdonald when he paid too much for the V8 supercars event at Homebush; World Youth Day was $66 million over forecast in 2008; and $778 million could have built hospitals in Tamworth and Wagga.</para>
<para>I remember just prior to the last state election when the then Premier, Morris Iemma, went up to Tamworth to put his arm round the Independent member and colleague Peter Draper, saying, ‘We will build you a new hospital in Tamworth.’ Where is the new hospital? It was a political stunt. Tamworth is the hub of the north-west and New England area. Tamworth is a vital hospital. Many people from outer regions are taken to Tamworth for essential medical care, but still there is no hospital. It was another broken promise.</para>
<para>I could go on to the power sale where former Premier Morris Iemma got the boot for wanting to privatise the electricity industry for around $31 billion. Along comes supersalesman Kristina Keneally and Eric Roozendaal and they sell it for $5.3 billion. You would not want them out flogging your products door to door as you would go broke.</para>
<para>I want to take you back to a couple of things, Madam Acting Deputy President, as time is running out. One of the things that the New South Wales Labor government did that I thought was so shameful during their almost 16 years in government was to introduce the blue card for truck drivers. ‘What is the blue card?’ you might ask. They brought in a law that any truckie who drives more than 500 kilometres must have a blue card saying they have been trained in OH&amp;S standards, even though we have strict OH&amp;S standards right throughout the industry. The blue card had to be purchased off a little company in Western Australia. Why in New South Wales would you buy the blue card off a company in Western Australia? It is simple. That company in Western Australia has direct links to the Transport Workers Union and it has been made public that every blue card bought for round $60, paid to Bluecard Australia in Western Australia, would then give a kickback to the Transport Workers Union who would then give a kickback to the Labor Party come election time. This was compulsory funding for the Labor Party that the Labor Party brought in for the New South Wales government and, to the shame of those opposite here, they tried to sneak in an amendment to the Fair Work Bill when that legislation came to this parliament to have it across all jurisdictions. This is the way they act: ‘We’ll have a compulsory little law. You have to buy something and we will get a kickback to help us in our next campaign at the election so we can spread our propaganda.’</para>
<para>It is amazing that, with 93 lower house seats in the New South Wales parliament, six seats still do not have Labor candidates, including Tweed Heads, Goulburn and Port Macquarie. I am sorry, I should not say Port Macquarie, as they have an Independent member—they are as good as a Labor candidate. We have seen that through the activities of Mr Windsor and Mr Oakeshott. So there is no need for Labor to run there. I was amazed last Saturday as I was driving past the office of the member for Monaro, Steve Whan, to see that there was no sign of any Labor pamphlets or anything. There was just ‘Steve Whan MP.’ They are hiding from their brand. They are ashamed to say they are members of the Labor Party, fearing that people will turn against them on 26 March. They are so disgusted with the Labor Party brand in New South Wales they are now hiding from it.</para>
<para>During the 2007 federal election I was campaigning in Ballina with Larry Anthony. We were having a chat and I said to Larry, ‘How do you see it?’ He turned to me and said, ‘Wacka, when the tide is coming in you can do nothing about it,’ and Larry was correct. People saw through the spin of Kevin Rudd, Kevin 07. There are no Labor brands out there now in the state election. They have to hide from that. But they went out with the Kevin 07 Labor brand and they won the election. He did not last long, though, because those sitting behind over there saw the spin and the people woke up to him. What happened to Kevin 07? He was speared. We all know the history of that.</para>
<para>On 26 March it is not the tide coming in on the New South Wales Labor government but a tsunami, and so it should be for the way they have wasted money, destroyed business confidence, flooded the whole state in red tape and shifted people out of the state to Queensland. As a result, we have lost two federal seats from New South Wales to Queensland. I can understand some of those Labor people like Steve Whan hiding from the Labor brand and having out the front of their office ‘Vote 1 Steve Whan’ but no mention of the Australian Labor Party. They are ashamed of what they have done and the way they have run the state of New South Wales, even to the stage where just recently Premier Kristina Keneally apologised to the people of New South Wales because they put themselves and their factional blues first and forgot about the people of New South Wales. Bring on 26 March. Bring on the tsunami and throw them out.</para>

<para>—I thank Senator Abetz for his question. The tragedy that has taken place across Australia in Queensland, Western Australia, Victoria, Tasmania and in a range of local regions makes all Australians very grateful that our emergency services coped as well as they did. The issue that Senator Abetz goes to is very specific. I would like to have some discussion about the financing of all the assistance packages because Senator Abetz is asking about funding for businesses. We are in the process of providing funding for small businesses in a whole raft of measures.</para>

<para>—Mr President, on the point of order, the acting leader was answering the question. One of the difficulties that always arises on this point of order is the way the question is framed. It was not a specific question, it was a general question about loan schemes. It was not in the area of what it is designed to do, that is, the natural disaster relief and recovery arrangements. Under those arrangements there are assistances to small businesses of up to $250,000 and that is the question that, perhaps, could have been asked but was not asked. To demand a specific answer to the question that was asked is out of order.</para>

<inline font-size="8pt">Conroy, Sen Stephen</inline>Senator CONROY—Thank you, Mr President. As I was saying, joint state and Commonwealth assistance is being provided to small businesses under the Natural disaster relief and recovery arrangements in disaster declared local government areas. Under these arrangements eligible small businesses and primary producers can access recovery costs and concessional loans. For example, in Queensland, eligible businesses and primary producers can receive concessional interest rate loans of up to $250,000 and freight subsidies of up to $5,000. These arrangements have been extended to 29 local government areas. Eligible small businesses and primary producers can receive recovery grants of up to $25,000 for primary producers, and small business grants are available in 22 local government areas and six partial local government areas. The Gillard government is also providing additional finance assistance. <inline font-style="italic">(Time expired)</inline>

<para>—We wish Senator Evans a speedy recovery as we might get some answers. Mr President, I ask a supplementary question. How much money has the government already given to people described by the Treasurer as ‘low-lifes’ who claimed $1,000 from Centrelink when all they suffered was a power outage? Are businesses that are economically impacted by the floods more or less deserving?</para>

<para>—You have asked for a very specific number and I am happy to seek further information from the Treasurer to get that very specific number that you have been asking for. Let us be clear, the government is providing an enormous amount of assistance despite the opposition from those opposite who continue to run a cheap political campaign. Maybe the funds that they have raised for their Liberal Party might be donated to those businesses and flood victims across the country who have a genuine need for them. Maybe, just maybe, if those opposite were not engaged in humbug and hypocrisy when it comes to assisting flood victims, cyclone victims and bushfire victims, we might actually have some genuine debate rather than hypocrisy from those opposite. <inline font-style="italic">(Time expired)</inline>

<para>—Mr President, I assume that was a directly relevant answer. I ask a further supplementary question. Is the appointment of Mr John Fahey, a former Liberal finance minister, to oversee the reconstruction spending an admission by the government of its own inability to properly administer taxpayer funds? Why could the government not trust its own finance minister to do the job?</para>

<para>—This government will get the recovery and reconstruction right, with checks and balances every step of the way. That is why the Prime Minister has asked John Fahey to chair a reconstruction watchdog reporting directly to the Prime Minister through the national disaster recovery subcommittee. He will be assisted by Martin Albrecht, a former director of Thiess, and Matt Sheerin, who leads the Queensland audit practice of the global accounting firm Deloitte. This watchdog will ensure proper scrutiny, accountability and, most of all, value for money. Through John Fahey we will work to see that every dollar to be spent is effective in the regions that need it. Mr Fahey can inspect and advise on contracts before they are signed. <inline font-style="italic">(Time expired)</inline>

<para>—I thank Senator Furner for his question. The impact of the floods across Australia is unprecedented. This is one of the biggest natural disasters ever to hit our nation. In Queensland we have seen a once-in-a-generation natural disaster followed by another devastating weather event in Cyclone Yasi. Much of Queensland has been impacted by these disasters. For some the loss has been, quite frankly, devastating. Everyone around Australia is thinking of those families who are grieving and who have suffered loss.</para>
</talk.start>
<para>Queensland of course is still assessing the full impact of these natural disasters. The state and the Commonwealth will continue to made a significant contribution in the initial emergency response and to the rebuilding effort. It is a national responsibility to respond to these challenges. We should respond, and have responded, as a nation. The Gillard government has responded and quickly rolled out emergency financial assistance. This includes the Natural disaster relief and recovery arrangements, the Australian Government disaster recovery payment and the Disaster income recovery subsidy. As of 8 February, across Australia over 350,000 payments from the Australian Government disaster recovery payment have been made to a total of around $413 million, over 44,000 Disaster income recovery subsidy payments have been made totalling over $18 million and Commonwealth agencies such as Centrelink continue to work with communities that have been affected in areas right across South-East Queensland up to Emerald and into the Cyclone Yasi area of Far North Queensland. The Australian Defence Force and federal law enforcement officer staff from our human services agencies are doing a tremendous job on the ground getting Queensland back up and running again.

<para>—I thank Senator Furner for his first supplementary question. The Gillard government has made the tough decisions to find the funds required to rebuild after these natural disasters and keep our economy strong. The Prime Minister has announced that the government will fund the reconstruction effort through $2.8 billion to be delivered through spending cuts and $1 billion to be delivered by delaying some infrastructure projects. Also, $1.8 billion will be provided by a modest one-year progressive levy, which will not be paid by people directly affected by these disasters or by those on incomes of less than $50,000.</para>

<para>For every $1 dollar raised through the levy $2 will be saved in the federal budget. The government will ensure that the funds are spent effectively and efficiently and that they are targeted to the areas where they are needed the most. That is the responsible thing to do to ensure that we join together to rebuild Queensland, which has suffered significantly under these natural disasters. <inline font-style="italic">(Time expired)</inline>

<para>—It is good to see that you enjoyed good Christmas cheer, Senator Brandis. You have come back with a good sense of humour. As I said earlier, through Mr John Fahey, the government will work to see every single dollar spent effectively in the regions that need them. Mr Fahey has the power to inspect and advise on contracts before they are signed, examine high-value or complex projects prior to execution, examine projects undertaken by local government and check spending and project milestones. The government is also keen to ensure that we can bring private sector experience to bear on project management, tendering and contractual frameworks. The government wants to get the rebuilding right.</para>

<para>We have seconded Major General Mick Slater to chair the Queensland government’s reconstruction authority and Mr Brad Orgill will be sitting on the authority’s board to make sure that value for money is front of mind.

<para>Without the stimulus, we would have seen thousands of skilled workers exit the construction sector and be lumped into the unemployment line. In the US, for example, over one in four construction jobs were lost. We acted to make sure that that did not happen here.

Our priority remains the wellbeing of Australians. We remain deeply concerned by intimidation of journalists and opposition activists. We deplore the loss of life. We welcome efforts of the army to protect peaceful protestors from violent attacks and intimidation. Mr Rudd has spoken to the Egyptian foreign minister about the need for political reform and for the process to begin, and he has informed him that the attacks on protestors and journalists were unacceptable. Egypt has been the focus of Mr Rudd’s discussions with world leaders, including Mr Netanyahu and Mr Blair. We are concerned about the stability of Egypt, as it is vital to the Middle East region.</para>

<para>In terms of your question on some of the allegations about some activities of the services in Egypt, we are aware of some allegations. It is not appropriate for us to speculate on the operations of another country’s intelligence service in this setting.

We know what your view on the Murray-Darling is. We know that it is not the same as the rest of your colleagues. We know that you have just deferred, have not taken a hard decision, your claimed spending cuts—a deferral of water buybacks.

<para>—Mr President, I ask a supplementary question. Minister, we look forward to you being part of taking the high road in supporting our inquiry this afternoon. That might be a decision for you. In the meantime, can you please explain how the government can maintain that the Murray-Darling Basin Authority remains an independent authority when an ex-Labor minister mate, whom a Labor government has appointed, is appointing his own board, circumventing the members appointed under the act? Is this not just another example of the government losing control over water? You might want to confer with Minister Wong and corroborate your stories.</para>

<para>—I thank Senator Moore, a Queensland senator, for her question. As we know, the Queensland floods are likely to be the largest natural disaster in our history in economic terms. We have all seen the human cost, as well, graphically and tragically displayed in recent weeks. As a government we are faced with two tasks—rebuilding Queensland and returning the federal budget to surplus. We are focused on both. This government has delivered a $5.6 billion package to rebuild Queensland and other flood-affected areas in Australia; a package that is both fiscally responsible and economically sound. Two-thirds of our package will be funded through spending cuts—two out of every three dollars. Another third will be delivered through a modest one-year progressive levy which will not be paid by people directly affected by floods or by low-income earners. Some 60 per cent of taxpayers will pay less than a dollar a week to help rebuild Queensland.</para>
</talk.start>
<para>Obviously the government has had to make hard decisions in putting this package together. We have had to reduce funding for or cut programs which were priorities before the floods but which clearly, now that the focus is on rebuilding and reconstruction, cannot have the same priority. This government is delivering quickly on rebuilding—it is focused on rebuilding, unlike some—but at the same time it is also ensuring we protect our fiscal position. Yesterday we saw the opposition’s much heralded package. We heard so much about how tough it was going to be; so much about how easy it was going to be to find savings. But of course we know now how little work was actually done. <inline font-style="italic">(Time expired)</inline>

<para>—I will gladly answer Senator Moore’s question because the fact is that no credible alternative package has been put forward, despite all the chest beating from Mr Abbott and Mr Hockey and Mr Robb about how easy it was to find savings. This package fails on every level. It is driven by politics, not by what is right for Australia. There is no support for this alternative package. What Mr Abbott has announced is truly a friendless package. The Liberal frontbench does not support it. The coalition party room does not support it, particularly the National Party, whose leader has been humiliated. Many parts of industry hate it. The international aid community and supporters of the Murray-Darling Basin certainly do not support it, and South Australians certainly will not be able to support it. <inline font-style="italic">(Time expired)</inline>

<para>—The primary risk to achieving this goal is the opposition. It is an opposition that had a $10.6 billion black hole in their election costings, and they are already a further $5.2 billion behind because of their refusal to pass our savings measures. Yesterday they put forward a package which double-counted $700 million. They refuse to pass savings measures and they have put forward a package which will increase the deficit next year. This opposition talks about being fiscally responsible. They had an opportunity yesterday to demonstrate that, and they have sorely failed. They have continued the tough talk that we heard in the election campaign, but they have a $10.6 billion black hole that was expanded again yesterday. <inline font-style="italic">(Time expired)</inline>

<para>—Thank you for the generous introduction to your question, Senator. As has been stated on many occasions, under the agreement that the government reached with Telstra last year we will match the footprint, both underground and overhead, of the Telstra existing network.

In terms of the National Broadband Network build in Townsville, we have seen minimal disruption to the network.</para>

<para>The relative merits of fibre versus copper are fairly well known. Fibre is clearly superior in resisting water and floods, so in terms of the argument as to what is going to last longer—fibre in the ground, fibre hanging or copper—clearly fibre is superior. For those who continue to not keep up with the technology debate, fibre connects every single mobile phone tower. A wireless system does not work on the basis that a phone call goes from my phone and it flies all the way through the air to your phone, wherever you are standing in the country. It actually goes to the nearest tower, and then it is sucked down into the ground and, guess what, it is transmitted along a piece of fibre all the way to the phone tower nearest to you, and it comes up there and then gets transmitted. <inline font-style="italic">(Time expired)</inline>

The hospital will now be forced to close in April of this year unless further funding is found. In a letter to Mr James DeBarro, chair of the hospital’s board of management, Minister Roxon stated that the government will ensure funding reflects the higher costs associated with delivering services in regional and rural areas of Australia, including providing block funding where appropriate.

<para>—I thank Senator Xenophon for his question and his continued interest in South Australia’s hospitals. Minister Roxon and this government understand the importance of local private hospitals to regional communities and the role they play in keeping sick and aged patients in their local areas. However, on behalf of the minister, the level of subsidy the South Australian government pays to community private hospitals such as the Keith and District Hospital is clearly a matter for the state government of South Australia.</para>

<para>I note that the letter received by Mr DeBarro was from Ms Alison McCausland, business manager of the Acute Care Division of the Department of Health and Ageing, who was writing on the minister’s behalf. The departmental response and the section Senator Xenophon refers to explain the government’s National Health and Hospital Network reforms and how they will relate to funding for public hospitals. The Commonwealth continues to support private hospitals through its funding contribution of private health insurance, Medicare, PBS, DVA, aged care and some capital works projects. The Keith hospital received aged-care funding in 2009-10. The Keith hospital received over $770,000 in 2009. We also provided the Keith hospital with $500,000 to build the new Hill Wing. I understand that the South Australian government are conducting meetings with the Keith hospital to help them restructure and reprioritise their services. I would also encourage them to work with the department of health to maximise the existing Commonwealth funding streams.

The Keith and District Hospital currently receives significant funding from the provision of aged-care services. In 2009-10 the Keith hospital received over $770,000, including an ongoing viability supplement in recognition of the difficulties of scale that smaller regional aged-care providers face. I understand that the hospital has received suggestions from South Australian Country Health about how they may be able to prioritise certain services, such as aged care, and maximise their funding from these streams. I would also encourage the hospital to work through these options further with the South Australian government and the South Australian office of the Department of Health and Ageing.

I trust the hospital will be able to restructure its services and staffing, as well as maximise access to its existing funding streams, to continue to provide these important services to the area. The Department of Health and Ageing will be able to discuss further possibilities with the hospital executive.</para>

<para>Going back to the earlier response I made, I am informed that the South Australian departmental office has contacted the hospital executive to suggest a meeting to be able to progress some of these matters. I trust this will occur in the near future.</para>

<para>—I welcome the question from Senator Payne about SIHIP. There has been a great deal of discussion about SIHIP in this chamber and I have talked about the positive results that SIHIP has achieved throughout the Northern Territory. SIHIP is on track to deliver its target on time and on budget. It has already delivered 179 new houses, and 1,036 rebuilds and refurbishments. It has exceeded its end of year 2010 targets of 150 new houses and 1,000 rebuilds and refurbishments.</para>
</talk.start>
<para>I have also previously announced in this chamber that the Australian government has recently brought forward $316 million over the forward estimates for the national partnership. Of these funds, $190 million will be used for housing-related infrastructure, including sewerage and power. This will result in around 180 new houses and 180 rebuilds being ahead of schedule by the end of 2013. This is over and above the original SIHIP targets of 750 new houses and 2,730 rebuilds and refurbishments.</para>
<para>In relation to employment we know that SIHIP has already exceeded the employment targets that the government have set. We set a target of 20 per cent; we have already exceeded it with 30 per cent. They are jobs for Indigenous people—</para>

<para>—The government are determined to reduce overcrowding. We recognise that this is essential for protecting children. We are investing unprecedented levels of funding in remote housing to address this. With the Northern Territory government, we are building an appropriate mix of housing to cater for different-sized families. This has been discussed with the community to ensure that new houses suit the needs of families in those communities and cater to singles, young families and the elderly—many of whom prefer to live apart from their extended families. Fifty per cent will have three bedrooms. In Maningrida, for example, the program will deliver over 100 new homes, increasing the number of houses in that community by over 50 per cent. Again, we have consulted with local communities to ensure that the needs of those communities are being met. <inline font-style="italic">(Time expired)</inline>

<para>—Senator Payne is wrong. This is a program that is delivering results for Indigenous people. Look at the new houses that are being put in place—again, 179 new houses and 1,036 rebuilds. The program is already ahead of the targets we set. Money is being brought forward so that we can do more. Senator Payne is right that, in the first period of SIHIP, there were issues and the government has said that. But at the same time Minister Macklin stepped in and put in place her own FaHCSIA officials to work with the Northern Territory to get the program back on track—and it is back on track. We are meeting our targets. This is a good result for the government, a good result for Indigenous people and a good result for the Territory. Senator Payne has her facts wrong.</para>

<para>—I thank Senator Hutchins for raising a very serious issue. Firstly, I offer our sympathies and support to the many thousands who have been affected by the massive and widespread destruction that has occurred throughout Australia and particularly Queensland. Small business people and farmers deserve our support, both as fellow Australians and as part of our national economy.</para>
</talk.start>
<para>There are well-established procedures and there is well-established assistance available. Indeed my colleague Senator Ludwig touched on the joint state and Commonwealth assistance arrangements under the Natural disaster relief and recovery arrangements in disaster declared local government areas. Under these arrangements, eligible small businesses and primary producers can access recovery grants and concessional loans. For flood-affected small businesses in Queensland, Tasmania and Western Australia, the grants can be up to $25,000. In New South Wales, they are up to $15,000. In Queensland, concessional loans of up to $250,000 are available. In Victoria, the loans are up to $200,000 and they are up to $130,000 in New South Wales. In Western Australia, interest rate subsidies for primary producers and small businesses are also available. There are some variations from state to state concerning the levels of assistance and the types of assistance that are made available.</para>
<para>I also inform the Senate that the Australian Taxation Office has itself introduced some support measures to ease the load on small businesses and the farming community while they recover—for example, by deferring the December monthly activity statements by one month, until 21 February, for all Queensland and affected Northern New South Wales and Victorian areas and, as another example, in helping with the management of existing debt by allowing additional time—<inline font-style="italic">(Time expired)</inline>

<para>—I can well understand why senators on the Labor side of the parliament want to stop me from talking about this. They are very embarrassed about their very bad track record over the last three years when it comes to superannuation. This Labor administration have had a terrible record over the last three years when it comes to superannuation. They have failed to take on board many of the Cooper review’s very sensible recommendations to improve corporate governance arrangements for superannuation. They have created and then continued to protect a closed shop, anticompetitive arrangement when it comes to the selection of default superannuation funds under modern awards. And then there is this issue here, with superannuants across Australia inadvertently breaching the concessional and non-concessional contribution caps, which on the face of it is an increasing problem on the back of decisions made by this government.</para>
</talk.start>
</continue>
<para>Let me explain the problem we have. As part of a very sensible policy to encourage and increase voluntary contributions to superannuation, the Howard and Costello government put in place the opportunity for people to make concessional contributions of about $50,000 per annum if they were below 50 years of age or $100,000 per annum if they were older than 50 years of age. In the lead-up to the 2007 election the then Rudd government promised that they would leave those contribution caps in place unchanged. They said they would not change them one bit—not one jot, not one tittle. But of course they did. They reduced them. And what is the effect? More and more people across Australia are inadvertently breaching those contribution caps, which were halved by this government with effect from 1 July 2009. What does it mean? It means they get slugged by this government with an additional tax. A similar problem exists in relation to non-concessional contributions, and again the feedback is that this problem is increasing.</para>
<para>This is not a case of people trying to mislead, cheat or deceive the tax office and somehow trying to avoid an obligation to pay tax, because clearly it is all transparent; it is all out there. Invariably, these mistakes are inadvertent. What should happen with inadvertent mistakes, as happens in the broader tax system, is that people should be able to correct their records. Instead, the government is applying, as far as non-concessional contributions to superannuation are concerned, the marginal rate of tax on top of income that has already been taxed potentially at the top marginal rate—potentially taxing people 93c in every dollar earned that ends up in that particular circumstance.</para>
<para>This is not a new problem; this is a problem that, to be fair, has existed for some time. But it is a problem that, as far as concessional contributions are concerned, has worsened under this government. If you bring those contribution caps down, inevitably more people are going to be caught by it. I want to know from this government how many people are being caught by it, how much additional tax they are paying to the government and what the government are going to do about it. I happen to know that this information is not complicated and complex for the government to identify, because the ATO are well aware of the issue and it is data that they surely collect as a matter of course. Whenever this government do not want to provide an answer, whenever they go into hiding, you know that they are up to something; you know that there is a problem. They clearly have something to hide.</para>
<para>As I mentioned earlier, Labor, as much as they try to sell themselves as the advocates of superannuation, actually have had a very bad track record over the past three years. There has not been much that is good happening in superannuation over the last three years. People are now locked into anticompetitive, closed shop default superannuation arrangements under modern awards. The government are not prepared to ensure that there are better corporate governance arrangements in place as recommended by Jeremy Cooper in his comprehensive review. I do not know why the government refuse to ensure that there are independent directors on all superannuation funds. I do not know why the government do not think it is sensible to ensure that, in order to avoid conflicts, people sit on only one board and not multiple boards. I do not know why they are opposing recommendations to ensure that there is proper transparency in the investment decisions made by various funds.</para>
<para>But I have a suspicion why. My suspicion is that we have a minister in Minister Shorten who is letting his union bias get in the way of acting in the public interest. If Minister Shorten was more focused on doing the job that he has got, instead of telling anyone who would listen that he will be Prime Minister in the lead-up to the next election, then we would be able to make a bit of progress. If he was focused on doing his job, he might be able to provide an answer within 30 days, as he is required to do under our standing orders, instead of giving us a big explanation as to how this data is somehow really complex. I happen to have in front of me information that has been provided in relation to these matters by the ATO previously and circulated across the industry and I am convinced that the ATO is well capable of providing the information that I have asked for in my question on notice. I think that as well Minister Sherry, who I am sure is across this issue, would actually be well aware that the ATO would be able to respond to these matters.</para>
<para>In fact, a lot of organisations have raised this issue with the government and a lot of organisations have raised this issue with the new Minister for Financial Services and Superannuation, including the Financial Planning Association of Australia. These organisations have made some very sensible recommendations and I would like to know what Minister Shorten is proposing to do about them. For example, the law should be amended to remove the 46.5 per cent penalty rate that applies when the non-concessional contribution cap has been breached inadvertently; instead the process should be to refund excess non-concessional contributions back to the taxpayer. It is their money. It has already been taxed at whatever the marginal tax rate is that applies to them. Why should the government tax it again? It is hardly in the superannuant’s interest to somehow conceive something so he can be whacked with a 93 per cent tax. Why isn’t the government doing what needs to be done to quantify the problem, to take action and to resolve it? There should not be a monetary penalty, according to the Financial Planning Association, if it is the taxpayer’s first-ever breach of the non-concessional contribution cap. I think that is a sensible suggestion. There should be a monetary penalty or perhaps an administration cost recovery fee charged to the taxpayer if there are subsequent breaches of the contributions cap. And there is a whole range of other recommendations that I am happy to forward to the minister so he might actually be able to focus on how to do his job and resolve issues for the Australian people.</para>
<para>But the important thing to remember is that clearly this is a problem which has got worse as a direct result of the actions taken by this government. Instead of encouraging people who are at a stage of their life when they can better afford to make additional contributions to their superannuation, this government reduces the caps. It halves the concessional contribution caps, which is exactly the wrong way to go if you want to boost retirement savings. So it is talking about wanting to increase the superannuation guarantee from nine to 12 per cent, instead of encouraging more voluntary contributions. As a direct result of what the government has done, people across Australia are being penalised and are paying more tax than they should have to. I think the government should provide a proper explanation in relation to all these matters.</para>
<para>Let us go through the questions which the minister says are too complicated to answer but for which I am absolutely convinced the minister has the information sitting on his desk right now. Remember that these are the sorts of questions that the minister says are too complex. So for the last three financial years:</para>
<quote>
<para class="block">...  how many individuals made contributions above the concessional and non-concessional contribution caps respectively;</para>
</quote>
<para class="block">I am convinced the minister knows the answer to that question. I bet he has got a briefing note in his office right now which is telling him exactly how many people have been caught by this. I am convinced that the number of people that are being caught by this is increasing. Then:</para>
<quote>
<para class="block">... what was the average amount paid above the concessional and non-concessional contribution caps respectively;</para>
</quote>
<para class="block">I am convinced the Australian Taxation Office has got that information in front of them and I would be surprised if they had not made that information available to the minister. Then:</para>
<quote>
<para class="block">... what was the total amount of taxation collected as a result of contributions above the concessional and non-concessional contribution caps respectively;</para>
</quote>
<para class="block">That is an entirely legitimate question. In essence, how many people are getting hit with this and how has this been trending over the last three years? How much in additional tax are they paying when they should not be paying any additional tax? Then:</para>
<quote>
<para class="block">... what was the average amount of excess concessional contributions that counted towards the relevant individual’s non-concessional contribution caps for the same period; ...</para>
</quote>
<para class="block">That is very sensible information for us to be able to assess the extent of the problem. What this really comes down to is that we have a minister who is continuing to regurgitate all of the statements about superannuation that have been made by his predecessors. He has not come up with one single new idea of his own. He has not attacked one single problem that exists in the superannuation industry today and made a decision on how to fix it. All we have had is this union-bias-driven protection of the current process of selecting the default superannuation funds under modern awards. We have had some vague response to the recommendations of the Cooper review that are, quite frankly, non-controversial and we have had a regurgitation of statements that had been made by his predecessors in relation to the proposal to increase the superannuation guarantee from nine to 12 per cent and the proposed introduction of MySuper.</para>
<para>The minister has backed away from commitments that were made by this government in the lead-up to the most recent election. I think those might have even been through Minister Sherry, if not Minister Bowen—I do not remember exactly. In the lead-up to the last election the government made an election commitment to fix up the process by which default superannuation funds are selected under modern awards—so they would make it more open, more transparent, more evidence based, more competitive—and said they would ask the Productivity Commission to do the job for them. But as soon as the government scraped back in and we got this new minister for superannuation all of that was forgotten. It came down to the Senate to refer this particular matter to the Productivity Commission for report back to the Senate by the end of May. So the point I am making is it is just not good enough that Minister Shorten is not able to answer a question about an issue that is potentially impacting on thousands and thousands of Australians who are paying more than they should in taxes as a result of inadvertent breaches of their contribution caps, inadvertent breaches that are made more likely as a direct result of some of the decisions that have been made by this government. Specifically, this government has broken a promise not to reduce concessional contribution caps.</para>
<para>In relation to the non-concessional contribution caps, this is a particularly big problem because this is money that has already been taxed potentially at the top marginal tax rate. People are able to put $150,000 into their superannuation under the non-concessional contri-bution or $450,000 over three years. I am sure you would appreciate, Mr Deputy President, that a worker who has been doing the right thing and making voluntary contributions and contributing over and above the nine per cent may, for example, later in the year receive an unexpected pay rise or an unexpected bonus or shift to a new job with a higher rate of pay. He might have accumulated annual leave which is paid out on transferring jobs. He or she might have multiple jobs. People might have been paid in lump sums towards the end of the year and there can be inadvertent non-intentional mistakes made. Yet, instead of allowing people to fix up those mistakes, the government hits them with a top marginal tax on top of potentially having already charged the top marginal tax rate on the income that was generated in the first place. That is double taxation.</para>
<para>As I have mentioned, many advisers across Australia have made the legitimate point that this exposes Australians potentially to a 93 per cent rate of tax. I know that this is a high-taxing government. I know that the Labor Party is all about higher spending and higher taxes, but I am sure that even Labor senators would agree that a 93 per cent tax takes things beyond what is reasonable and is a circumstance that should be fixed. I am sure that a 93 per cent rate of tax is something that even Minister Shorten does not think is reasonable and I am sure that it is a rate of tax that even Minister Shorten thinks something should be done about. This is my point. If he has not got this sort of information in front to him to quantify the problem, how can we expect him to take action? How can we expect him to fix a problem that he apparently is not able to identify with the basic facts and figures underlying it in the first place?</para>
<para>The ATO should be able to exercise its discretion and give special consideration to the taxpayers who have exceeded contributions in a series of circumstances. For example, I give the minister a bit of advice on how he can fix this. Where the contribution is a one-off large amount due to the sale of an investment asset, including the sale of the taxpayer’s business or farm, and the tax penalty that will be incurred will cause serious detriment to the taxpayer’s ability to support themselves in retirement, there ought to be some discretion applied by the ATO. Similarly, where the employer has contributed an amount in excess of the caps due to an unanticipated pay rise or bonus amount or other payments made by the employer, the ATO should be able to apply some discretion as to whether the level of penalty as it currently applies is actually appropriate. Where a fund or clearing house has made an error causing the caps to be breached and where there has been an amount transferred into super from an overseas account and currency fluctuations or unpredictable timing issues have caused the contribution to exceed the caps or fall into the wrong time period, the ATO should be able to exercise some sensible discretion to make sure that there is not an inappropriate and disproportionate penalty imposed in the circumstances that I have explained.</para>
<para>The reality is—and this is the point I make again—that breaches of superannuation contribution caps would almost never be deliberate. They are pretty transparent. It is pretty obvious what has happened. It is not because a taxpayer or superannuant is trying to deceive anybody. There can be honest mistakes, and when they are honest mistakes they should be able to fix them. But I want to know how many people are getting caught up in those honest mistakes without the government doing anything about it. I happen to know that people have raised this with the minister on a number of occasions and so far nobody has had any satisfaction from the minister in relation to any of it.</para>
<para>The ATO should be asked by the government to have a look at how they manage their systems. If the ATO truly cannot identify this sort of data—and I am sure they can; I do not believe they cannot—then they will to have a look at their systems. If they cannot monitor the extent of this problem on an ongoing basis, how can they be expected to take appropriate corrective action?</para>
<para>In summary, it really is time that Minister Shorten starts to focus on the job he has rather than keep chasing the job he wants. We all know that he is telling everyone he wants to be Prime Minister. But he has a job now and there are people across Australia who need him to do his job when it comes to the impact of excess superannuation contributions being taxed at inappropriate levels as a result of inadvertent mistakes. It is an issue that has been brought to the attention of the minister. I note that the minister is not able to provide an answer on the number of people and the amount of tax involved within the time frame prescribed by our standing orders. That is very disappointing. I know that Minister Shorten and the Minister for Small Business, Senator Sherry, did not give us any indication as to when we might be able to expect an answer. That is also disappointing. I hope that Minister Shorten will carefully review the <inline font-style="italic">Hansard</inline> of this debate and will take note that he has a job to do and that the Australian people expect him to do the job he has rather than to spend his time on chasing the job he wants.</para>

<para>—I will be brief and direct my comments to some of the remarks and contribution made by Senator Cormann which relate directly to his question. I was not able to provide the information he has sought from the Minister for Financial Services and Superannuation, Mr Shorten. First, I make the point that the information that Senator Cormann has sought is complex to gather and bring together. It is not easy. I do have some familiarity with the details of the information that Senator Cormann is seeking, but best efforts are being made and I would hope that at least some of that material—if not all—can be provided as soon as possible.</para>
</talk.start>
<para>The second point I make is that Senator Cormann refers to the current penalty regime. What I would point out to Senator Cormann and to anyone listening to this debate is that the current penalty regime was introduced by the former Liberal government.</para>

<para>—Yes, which we supported. But the caps, Senator Abetz, as I do recall, were introduced by the former Liberal government when it introduced an annual cap on superannuation contributions. So the penalty regime has always applied to people who breach those caps, regardless of the level of the cap. There were always people who were penalised. It was your regime. If you argue now that the tax regime and the level of penalty were unfair, why did you not deal with that issue when you were in government and when you introduced the simpler super provisions?</para>

<para>—Senator Cormann, I listened to you in silence. I do not want to speak for 20 minutes, I just want to put on the record the facts in respect to where these penalty provisions came from. In terms of the nine per cent super guarantee being included as part of contributions, if there are contributions over and above the nine per cent, that was very, very clearly stated at the time of the introduction of the simpler super package as put forward by the former Liberal government. I certainly am aware that there have been representations, concerns and complaints raised about this issue. I am, frankly, a little bit surprised that some in the financial planning community and other areas of superannuation who are now raising this issue, did not raise it at the time. Some of them may have, I have to say, but I did not hear from them when I was considering this legislation and penalty regime from opposition. I did not hear from them about it then.</para>

<para>—There are incessant interjections from Senator Cormann and Senator Abetz who, with respect, should have been paying more attention to this when they were in government. Perhaps some of those who are making representations on this issue now were at the time, probably understandably, distracted by other elements of the simpler super package such as the $1 million contributions. Perhaps they were focused on that rather than on the penalty regime, on which most of them, to my recollection, were silent.</para>

<para>In terms of the critique of Senator Shorten I can assure the Senate that Senator Shorten is well and truly focused on his responsibilities as Minister for Financial Services and Superannuation. Indeed, he announced just prior to Christmas the most significant and widespread reforms of the operation to our superannuation system in this country since the introduction of compulsion. Senator Shorten, I can assure the chamber and those in the public listening, is well and truly focused on implementation of major reform, which he announced, that will see, amongst other things, the introduction of MySuper and SuperStream, which are essential reforms that will bring down the cost of operation of our system. It is estimated they will bring down the costs of aggregate fees in the system by approximately 40 per cent. For example, there is the proposed use of the TFN number as an identifier to minimise the multiple accounts we have in this country. There are 33 million accounts for about 12 million people in the workforce. There are over four million lost accounts. Minister Shorten is well and truly focused on implementing what is a comprehensive set of reforms that will make the operation of the superannuation system much more efficient and reduce those fees and charges. He is also focused on the future of financial advice and the very contentious issue of commission based selling of product in our financial system.</para>

Minister Shorten is well and truly focused on a major set of reforms in the tax system, particularly the administration of the tax system, and well and truly focused on other issues in financial services as well as on improving the capacity and capability of Australia as a financial centre. I represent him in this chamber and I am very pleased to do so. I totally refute the nonsense that Senator Cormann has gone on about this afternoon. It would have been better if he had done his research and looked back to find out who introduced these penalties. It was a Liberal government. I do not know whether you, Senator Cormann, were actually in the Senate or in the parliament at the time of simpler super. My best recollection is that you were not, therefore I cannot criticise you, Senator Cormann, for failing to point out these penalties at the time of simpler super. There are certainly a lot of other senators—some now in this chamber—who were there at the time and did not point it out. I just want to put on the record that what Senator Cormann complains about was introduced by a former Liberal government.</para>

My office and I personally have raised the matter with the office of the Minister for Immigration and Citizenship. I have been advised of the following: there was a total of 445 questions lodged, many of which had subparts and which, as was indicated, were taken on notice at the supplementary budget estimates hearing. Many of the questions sought detailed information on a number of complex and sensitive issues. I am sure that any fair-minded person would acknowledge that the period since the hearing has been one of exceptionally high tempo for the Department of Immigration and Citizenship. I am assured that the department is putting significant effort into providing all responses to the committee. I have also been assured that all questions will be answered promptly.</para>

<para class="block">I have been pursuing the answers to the 445 questions—of which 326 were asked by me, as I understand it—outstanding from this estimates committee. Whilst I accept the response given by Minister Carr was given in his role as Acting Minister for Immigration and Citizenship, I am sure that if these matters were within Minister Carr’s portfolio and he were in charge of the answers then I would not be standing here today. I am sure that Minister Carr would have ensured that his department provided me with the answers. The blame needs to be squarely put at the door of the relevant minister—and that is Minister Bowen—and the failure of the department to provide answers to questions on notice, at least nine weeks after the due date, represents yet another failing within what is an exceptionally important portfolio.</para>
<para>My attack today is not directed at Senator Carr, because I understand he is merely delivering a message to me in his acting capacity. I know that, if I were Minister Carr, I would be very embarrassed about having to stand here today and deliver that message to the Senate on behalf of the relevant minister. Minister Carr has been well and truly let down by Minister Bowen in this regard. Despite the alleged complexity of the questions that I have asked, they are questions that can be readily answered by referring to departmental records or to government policy documents, something which I would have thought Minister Bowen, as the relevant minister, would be able to do. That is clearly not the case. The evidence is that not one of the 445 questions that were placed on notice in October last year have been responded to by the minister or his department. This casts doubt over whether or not the minister actually understands his portfolio and it also casts doubt on his capacity to actually discharge his functions as Minister for Immigration and Citizenship.</para>
<para>If Minister Bowen is having trouble getting answers to the questions on notice from his department then perhaps it is time for him to look very closely at the senior management in his department. The question arises: is the department letting down the minister or, alternatively, is the minister letting down this parliament? No wonder we have problems in Immigration, with Minister Bowen obviously running for cover and not wanting to admit to the Australian people, by providing answers to questions that have been quite rightly asked during the estimates period, what is going on in his department.</para>
<para>The date set for the answering of the questions from the October supplementary hearing was 3 December 2010, some nine weeks ago. The minister and his department are well aware that this time period has well and truly expired. I do not think it comes as any surprise to anyone in this chamber that we have not received any answers at all—not one—to the 445 questions which the opposition have on notice. There is a reason for that. Despite the rhetoric that the Prime Minister of Australia has been espousing, in particular, when she took over as Prime Minister, saying that she prided herself on running a government that would maintain the highest standards of openness and transparency what we now have, reflected in the minister’s failure to ensure that answers were provided to these questions, is a government that is running at 100 miles an hour from that statement by the Prime Minister. When Prime Minister Julia Gillard was elected, one of the promises she made to the Australian people—we can now clearly see and we will remember that this is just yet another one of her broken promises—was that she would open the windows and ‘let the sunshine in’. That was reported in the <inline font-style="italic">Sydney Morning Herald</inline>, on 7 September—after the election—in an article with a huge banner headline, ‘Let the sunshine in’. The article stated:</para>
<quote>
<para class="block">The Prime Minister, Julia Gillard, says her minority government will be held to higher standards of accountability as a result of the deal struck with the independents.</para>
</quote>
<para>               …              …              …</para>
<quote>
<para class="block">We will be held to higher standards of transparency and reform and it’s in that spirit that I approach the task of forming government.</para>
</quote>
<para class="block">One can only say that the relevant minister was not paying attention when his exulted leader was speaking. The Australian people are then entitled to ask this question: if he was not paying attention, what else has this minister failed to pay attention to? What else has this minister missed that is of critical importance to his portfolio? I remind the minister that accountability and openness in government requires those who exercise power while performing the functions of government to demonstrate in an open and practical sense that they have discharged their duty in a proper manner for the common good and in the public interest. In that regard, this minister and his department get a big fail. Perhaps the worst aspect of dealing with the former Rudd government and the current Gillard government is their lack of transparency, despite their continual rhetoric about being held to higher standards of openness and transparency. It is all rhetoric. They never had any intention of maintaining these standards. This is reflected in the response from Minister Carr today. Minister Bowen needs to understand and remember that every senator, as an elected member of the Senate, has fundamental constitutional and other rights conferred upon them which they are entitled to exercise in this chamber. One of those fundamental rights is that we are entitled to ask questions of the government. We are also entitled in asking those questions to receive considered answers to them in a timely manner. Minister Bowen has well and truly failed the test of accountability on every possible count. When it comes to the promise of openness and transparency that they made on the record to the taxpayer, the government clearly never had any intention of keeping it.</para>
<para>I remind the minister that, to enable a senator—and I include those on the other side in this—to properly exercise their duty, the government should be giving them answers to the questions that they ask. It is not good enough and will never be good enough for a minister to seek to avoid answering questions as this minister has done. This is what we have seen with the answer that was provided today by Minister Carr to my question. Was I surprised by the answer that was provided? No. This government, this department and this minister have not provided any answers at all to the 445 questions that are currently on notice. I am not surprised by that. Neither would the Australian public be surprised. When it comes to the discharge of his duties under this portfolio, this minister has completely failed the Australian people. The fact is that Minister Bowen is failing to ensure that his department provides to the Senate information that it has quite rightly and quite properly requested.</para>
<para>I thank Senator Carr for his response. It was an honest response. He was merely delivering a message that he had received from Minister Bowen. I understand that, if Minister Carr does not have the answers to those questions, he is unable to provide them to me today. However, it is an absolute indictment on Minister Bowen that, nine weeks after the due date for answers to these questions, not even one has been answered. He has not had the courtesy to provide even one answer to the 445 questions that are outstanding.</para>
<para>The question that the Australian people need to be considering is this: is the department letting the minister down? If the department is letting the minister down, the minister needs to have a very good look at his department. If it is not, then the only answer is that the minister is letting this parliament down, and that is contemptuous.</para>

<motion>
<para>That the Senate take note of the answer given by the Minister for Broadband, Communications and the Digital Economy (Senator Conroy) to a question without notice asked by Senator Brandis today relating to the appointment of Mr Fahey as chair of the ‘reconstruction inspectorate’ to oversee rebuilding projects after the natural disasters of summer 2011.</para>
</motion>
<para class="block">Labor’s appointment of John Fahey to oversee its $5.6 billion rebuilding fund is the biggest vote of no confidence by a government in itself and its finance minister. Senator Conroy said in his answer that Mr Fahey was appointed to ‘get it right’. If it needs one former Liberal finance minister to administer $5.6 billion, I wonder how many it might take to administer Senator Conroy’s $43 billion NBN program? Why don’t we have a swathe of former Liberal ministers to help administer that fund? I had the great privilege of serving under Minister Fahey when he was finance minister while I was Special Minister of State. I congratulate the government on his appointment, because it has appointed a good person. But the reason that it needed to appoint a good person is that the government recognises that in its own ranks it does not have a person of the stature and capacity of Mr Fahey. That is what the government has said.</para>
<para>What else does the Minister for Finance and Deregulation get her ministerial loading on her salary, the big white car and all the staff for? She gets all those spoils of office because there are responsibilities that go with the office. But what she has done is said: ‘I’ll keep all the spoils of office but I’ll outsource the responsibility to former Liberal minister Fahey.’ That is a dereliction of duty that the Australian taxpayer should not have to fund. It is a dereliction of duty that the taxpayers of Australia should not have to put up with.</para>
<para>But then one reflects: this comes after the debacle of the border protection policy, which has blown Labor’s budget by $1.1 billion—an extra burden on the Australian taxpayer because of that bungle. Just as an aside, I wonder why we did not get a border protection levy to pay for that $1.1 billion bungle by Labor. Because it was too politically sensitive, no doubt.</para>
<para>Then we have the GP superclinics. Foolish me, I thought GP stood for ‘general practitioner’. We now know it stands for ‘grand pork-barelling’ superclinics. Those superclinics were designated, not courtesy of the health department, not by a health imperative, but by a political imperative. The decision was not made by the Secretary of the Department of Health and Ageing but by the federal secretary of the Labor Party, concerned about their marginal seats campaign.</para>
<para>We then have the cash for clunkers debacle, the green loans scandal—and so the list goes on. It is no wonder that the government has lost confidence in itself to administer anything, and that is why it has had to revert to Mr Fahey. Mr Fahey knows how to clean up a mess. He was the minister for finance who came to office after Labor had promised that the budget was in balance, if not in surplus, and of course there was a huge hole in it—billions of dollars missing. And there was debt of $93 billion owing. Mr Fahey started the task of cleaning up that mess. I have no criticism of Mr Fahey but an absolute criticism of this government’s inability to find, amongst all the men and women on its front bench—indeed, even on its back bench—somebody with the capacity to administer a $5.6 billion fund, a fund that we support, a fund that we believe is necessary, a fund that we want to have administered in a good and proper manner to ensure that the rebuilding of Queensland and other areas around Australia after the devastating floods, cyclone and bushfires can take place. But why can’t a minister, who takes the oath of office to administer these funds, actually undertake the task which she is sworn to undertake? What is so obvious here is that the minister for finance herself is not in the chamber to defend the decision. Methinks she was not even consulted.</para>

<para>—Today in this place there were a range of questions, including the two that mentioned the appointment of Mr Fahey. We have seen the debate that has been carried out in the media for the last week or so continuing now in the chamber, leading up to the debate on what is going to happen around the legislation looking at the government’s response to the disasters in Queensland.</para>
</talk.start>
<para>Although it is very difficult to be surprised here very often, I am surprised that there would be any consideration of a process that is being put in place to engage the whole community in response to the unprecedented—and I use that word absolutely accurately—horror in Queensland from the flood destruction. One of the processes that the government has put forward is to have a special group looking at how the disaster response will be handled. That group will engage with people in Queensland at all levels—with industry, with the kinds of groups that have been set up already—to ensure that this response is the best it can possibly be. That is the role of government: to ensure that any response, to any action, is well thought out, well structured and, most importantly, responsive to the needs of those who are, in this case, severely disadvantaged.</para>
<para>One aspect of that has been to appoint a former finance minister, a man who is acknowledged as having great expertise—not just in government, because this decision looked at the kind of work Mr Fahey has done outside government, in particular the liaison he has done internationally in areas of sport and the work he has done in working with community organisations in other activities that he has succeeded most publicly in doing. I know that the opposition is very strong in saying this is by no means an attack on Mr Fahey. I accept that. However, attacking the process, attacking the decision to use this expertise, is actually saying that the government has no right to look at strategies that can be developed effectively and cooperatively and, most importantly, ensure that people see the importance of this particular process.</para>
<para>I know that members of the opposition have talked about other things that have cost more money—and that is true. But this particular process, the process that the government is bringing before the parliament, the $5.6 billion process, is responding to the awful circumstances that we all agree have impacted on the community in such an amazing way. Yesterday in this place we heard so many senators from across the country talking about the way what had happened in Queensland had impacted on them, the way the community had responded spontaneously to give in any way they could to be part of the solution. One of the elements of that solution will be the recovery process that has been developed by the government, while ensuring that there is the kind of openness and transparency we have just heard being put forward for an extended period of time as the way these things should occur. One of the strategies that the government is wanting to work on with all levels of government, industry and community is to engage a new group that is headed by Mr Fahey.</para>
<para>As to the personal attack on our minister: I know it is part of the political debate, I know that is the kind of thing that goes on in this place, but I object to it. There is no way that the personal attack on the expertise, the professionalism of our minister is part of a process that is trying to respond to a need. Everybody will have a role to play. No-one will be exempt from having some part to play in this response. Coincidentally, it is important to point out that Mr Fahey’s position is not actually working with the finance minister; it is actually working with Minister McClelland and Minister Ludwig, who has special responsibility in this area. So the way the opposition have framed their questions today—and I know we will hear more of this in days to come—actually misses the point, misses the key aspect of the strategy and in fact is an inappropriate political attack in an area where what we are trying to do as a government, hopefully with the agreement and cooperation of everybody in the parliament, is look at a special need, an horrific need. In fact, as you know, Mr Deputy President, the full cost of what is happening in Queensland has yet to be finalised. Every day more work is being done to look at the destruction and to look at the cost of rebuilding Queensland. We need to have a cooperative result.</para>

<para>—I rise to take note of answers by Senator Conroy to Senator Brandis. This is all about Labor being not able to control its waste. It has taken the appointment of a Liberal to address Labor’s waste and mismanagement of precious taxpayers’ dollars. If it has to do that for the disaster recovery process, why not keep going? Why not appoint Liberals to control waste in other portfolios? By putting in place this body to oversee flood and storm spending, Labor has accepted that the public does not believe that they can be trusted with money. You do not need a second bureaucracy to ensure the first bureaucracy spends money wisely. The fact that the government has resorted to going down this path shows that it cannot be trusted.</para>
</talk.start>
<para>Senator Abetz referred to some of the debacles in government. You only have to look at the debacle with Fuelwatch, the debacle with childcare centres, the great big mining tax and the GP superclinics. In estimates, the officials told us that there was no criteria. When we pressed them and asked what criteria they used to determine where they would put the GP superclinics—blank, no answer. What the government did was pretty obvious. Now it has come out that the political process was to put the superclinics in its marginal seats. Of course, we knew that at the time but finally it has come out. It is little wonder that it has gone down that process.</para>
<para>Following on from Senator Abetz’s comments, the appointment of John Fahey is a good one. I had the privilege to work for John, when he was Premier, as his senior private secretary from 1993 to 1994 at a time when it was very difficult in minority government in New South Wales. They were difficult times and Mr Fahey certainly had to deal with a lot of problems on a daily basis. I know that he brings good experience and will be well placed, no doubt, to attack the many problems and the many issues that he is going to uncover about Labor’s messes.</para>
<para>But let us look at potential alternatives to Mr Fahey. I went back and looked at the former Labor finance ministers—I notice that we went to a Liberal finance minister as opposed to the Labor ranks. We had Mr John Dawkins, who was Treasurer in the Keating Labor government for a couple of years; we had Ralph Willis, a former finance minister; we had Lindsay Tanner, but I think the wounds are still too raw for Mr Tanner to have been considered. Of course there was Peter Walsh. I went back and got a copy of Peter Walsh’s book <inline font-style="italic">Confessions of a Failed Finance Minister</inline>—obviously that is a difficulty that finance ministers have. I found this very interesting quote, which probably explains why the government did not appoint one of its own. He talks about his endorsement for the Senate and he states:</para>
<quote>
<para class="block">The simple country boy I then was believed that ministers in the Labor government must be more competent and astute than I could ever hope to be. Eventually that belief changed.</para>
</quote>
<para class="block">Some of the reasons can be found in the following chapters. His book makes very interesting reading.</para>
<para>When you look at Minister Wong—and Senator Moore takes exception because we are attacking the minister—the last time I looked at her responsibilities they included government financial accountability, governance and financial management frameworks, including procurement policy and services. That is interesting because when you look at the role that Mr Fahey now has to exercise, it is funny that he seems to have had subcontracted to him the very work that Minister Wong herself should be doing. That is what this is really all about—the incompetence of this minister. The government is so incompetent that it cannot do it in-house. It has to subcontract it out. We have Minister Conroy lauding that there are going to be other people who will be involved in this process. He had the audacity to refer to Mr Orgill. How much did he learn after he told us that we got value for money in the BER wasteful and disgraceful program?</para>

<para>—At the outset I must say that this is one of the most remarkably illogical debates that I have ever had the duty to participate in. Somehow or other, because the government chooses to appoint a particular person who was in their former life a minister for finance and a former Premier and who has had a very senior involvement in both the community sector and the private sector since his life in parliament, the government is at fault and the Minister for Finance and Deregulation in the government, who does not have portfolio responsibility or any involvement in the administration of the reconstruction efforts in Queensland and other places because they are administered by Senator Ludwig—the special minister for the purpose—and Minister McClelland in the other place, is somehow or other to be treated with disrespect and the government is said to have no confidence in her and that she has no role apart from that of finance minister.</para>
</talk.start>
<para>In fact, this is not a vote of no confidence in the government; it is not a vote of no confidence in Minister Wong. The appointment of Mr Fahey and several other very senior men and women from across the board to the committee overseeing reconstruction spending and reporting to Minister Ludwig and Mr McClelland, who then report to cabinet and the Prime Minister, demonstrates the government’s desire to have full and proper scrutiny, serious levels of accountability and serious levels of responsibility in the disbursement of public funds and its deter-mination to see that that scrutiny, accountability and responsibility in respect of public spending is carried out properly, with full and open transparency in the administration of those funds.</para>
<para>In that context, what are we discussing? We are discussing, as was suggested several times during question time, the most serious national disaster at least for 30 years and arguably longer. The government, in administering its part of the recovery, is properly focused on its two most important roles. Firstly, in an overall sense it has to maintain sound administration of public finance in this country by insisting upon a return to budget surplus, not dropping the ball at the first opportunity when difficult issues arise or difficult questions have to be answered but sticking to its economic plan of returning to budget surplus so that we will have sound fiscal and financial administration in this country. Secondly, the government is making some small contribution to the reconstruction in Queensland, particularly Brisbane and Far North Queensland and other areas we have all seen on TV in recent days. They have been subject to varying degrees of ongoing natural disaster. So, we have to focus on a budget surplus and on reconstruction.</para>
<para>Senator Abetz in his opening remarks made much of Minister Wong’s alleged abdication and dereliction of her responsibility. Mr Fahey, as previous speakers on this side have said, is most experienced. But there is not just him; it is a group of five very senior people from the private sector, from large corporations and companies involved in logistics and in the movement of people and goods. They have been asked to volunteer their time, to give of their skills, to assist those who are in need through no fault of their own. Mr Fahey, acknowledged as a former senior member of previous governments, has a role in that. The government would be silly and also churlish if it did not respect the fact that in a whole range of areas, whether they be flood mitigation or reconstruction efforts, there are people who, irrespective of their politics or their background, have particular skills and capabilities and they can assist the government to help the people of Queensland get on with their lives.</para>
<para>In some respects this is no different to a range of committees being established. Today we have had briefings from five or six senior people who are part of a government inquiry— <inline font-style="italic">(Time expired)</inline>

<para>—There is one issue upon which the opposition and the government senators are in heated agreement and that is the eminent qualifications of John Fahey for the role to which he has been appointed. That is not currently in dispute. I feel like I am living in a parallel universe, listening to some of the things that have come from members of the government in this discussion, and our incredulity comes from the fact that we are apparently governed—and I use the word loosely —by a federal government that feels the need to appoint what is charmingly titled an Australian Government Reconstruction Inspectorate. I challenge anyone to find something that edifying in the pages of George Orwell, quite frankly.</para>
</talk.start>
<para>The role of the Reconstruction Inspectorate is, to quote from the Prime Minister’s statement of Monday of this week, to increase the scrutiny and accountability of rebuilding projects. The tasks that the inspectorate will undertake include scrutinising rebuilding contracts; directly inspecting projects to ensure they are meeting progress milestones—I do have a mental picture of Mr Fahey and Mr Orgill and Ms Beauchamp and Mr Albrecht and Mr Sheerin in gumboots, or whatever required footwear is avail-able, physically inspecting reconstruction projects; investigating complaints or issues raised by the public; working directly with state reconstruction agencies to develop contractual frameworks, tendering processes and project management systems; scrutinising requests for reimbursement by local government for projects completed for the purposes of reconstruction; and examining high-value or complex projects prior to execution.</para>
<para>They are the tasks of this so-called inspectorate. Quite frankly, this begs the question: what is the government itself doing? What is the role of the Commonwealth bureaucracy in this nation in 2011? We saw what its role was in 2010—we have lived through pink batts and we have lived through the fires in roofs, and we have lived through the BER; we have seen all of that. Is there nothing to be learned from those processes within the Commonwealth bureaucracy? Senator Bishop tells us that we have in fact been speaking about the wrong minister here today—he says it is not a reflection on the finance minister; apparently it is a reflection on Senator Ludwig and Mr McClelland because they are the responsible ministers and their departments are the responsible departments. Two of them. It is absolutely mind blowing that we need a Reconstruction Inspectorate to do the job of scrutiny that the Commonwealth is charged with itself.</para>
<para>Senator Bishop said this afternoon that this is about full and proper scrutiny. I believe he also used the word ‘transparency’. He said it is about serious levels of accountability and about serious levels of responsibility in the disbursement of government funds. Well what does a government do if it cannot do that job? I think the answer is in the silence. The answer is that if the government is not competent to do that, it is not competent to govern. The appointment of this committee is an important decision by government. It is an interesting admission that the government cannot manage its own business. Is the issue that with Ken Henry leaving everyone with an audit capacity is going too? What is actually going on within the structure of the system that means we need this sort of operation? I would have thought that the Australian people would have a reasonable expectation that their government is capable of managing this process.</para>
<para>I, along with every other speaker—in my case, a particular long-term awareness of and great admiration for the capacity of former Premier of New South Wales and former federal finance minister John Fahey—would commend the appointment of John Fahey. There is no question about that, or the appointment to any role to which he wished to turn his hand. But the admission by government that it is not capable of doing this job itself is breathtaking. It is the sort of admission that should stop the presses. It is the sort of admission that should make the Australian people stand still and say, ‘What is going on? What do we expect from the Commonwealth government, the Commonwealth bureaucracy, if they are not capable of dealing with this very, very important initiative themselves?’ The answer is: they got the wrong government.</para>

Of course, we do not know the final number of people who perished as part of that incident. The reports are that upwards of 60 people could have died.</para>

<para>I also note that, while importantly and deservedly yesterday we had a lot of time in this chamber put aside for condolences on the natural disasters and the death of an Australian soldier in Afghanistan, it would have been a good idea for the government to schedule some time for us to move an official condolence motion on this tragedy as well. I find it disappointing that the government did not. I hope that all sides of the chamber will support this motion but I would like it noted that I think a formal condolence motion included in yesterday’s list would have been appropriate.</para>

<para>—The government supports this motion. I rise today to acknowledge the terrible tragedy that occurred on 15 December last year when the vessel known as SIEV221 succumbed to very rough seas and sank just off the coast of Christmas Island. At least 30 people died that day, along with an unknown number who are missing and presumed dead. Remarkably, and owing to the bravery of the Border Protection Command and Christmas Island residents themselves, 42 people survived the wreck—41 who were rescued from the water and one man who managed to swim ashore. Today, with great sadness and respect, we acknowledge the men, women and children who lost their lives in this tragic accident, express our sincere sympathy and condolences to their families and friends and pay tribute to the courageous men and women who assisted with the rescue efforts. I thank the Senate.</para>

<para>—The opposition too supports this motion. What occurred off the coast of Christmas Island on 15 December 2010 was a human tragedy. However, as we reflect on the loss of life it is also incumbent upon us as legislators to ask why it occurred and what these people actually died for. Unfortunately, we do know what the answer to that question is. They died for a shipwrecked promise sold by people smugglers. On that point we need to be very clear. The people who sent these poor souls to their death were criminal people smugglers and we should be doing what is within our power to end this evil trade.</para>

<para>SIEV221 was the 200th boat to arrive in Australian waters after the Labor government, under the guise of compassion, began unravelling the tough border protection measures it inherited from the previous government in August 2008. When Labor came to government only four unauthorised boat people were in detention and there had been only 10 boats in six years. There are now more than 7,000 people from unlawful boat arrivals in Australia’s overstretched and unsustainable detention network and more than 1,000 children are included in that number. As well as those who died on SIEV221, there have been well-founded reports of a further 170 deaths of people trying to reach Australia over the open sea since August 2008.</para>
<para>People smugglers must be denied a product to sell, which will stop people from getting on the boats. Until the government admits to its failures, we will continue to count the costs. We mourn those who perished that fateful day and we are ever thankful that lives were saved. Our greatest hope is that we do not have to stand here in this place to mourn again.</para>

<para>—The government have a terrible track record when it comes to the management of our public finances. They are big spenders. As they are big spenders that is why they have to come up with one new tax hike after another. They have a track record of waste, mismanagement and incompetence, which is why they are unable to pursue genuine tax reform focused on simpler, fairer and lower taxes. Ad hoc tax grabs from an ad hoc incompetent government—that is what we have experienced under this Labor administration over the last three years.</para>
</talk.start>
<para>We have been given all these reasons as to why one tax hike after another is justified. Whenever Labor see a problem they think the only solution to address the problem or challenge is yet another tax. It is important for us to remember that this Labor government’s mismanagement of our public finances started from the word go. It did not start with the global financial crisis, as the Labor government so very often want us to believe.</para>
<para>I remind the chamber and people across Australia that in their first budget Labor increased taxes by a staggering $20 billion and increased net spending by $15 billion. This is a government which inherited from the Howard-Costello government a very strong fiscal position. They inherited no government net debt. They inherited a government with $45 billion in the bank. They inherited a government with a $20 billion surplus.</para>
<para>But since then what have we experienced? We have experienced three successive deficits and, in fact, we have not had a single surplus budget from this government in a year where they have been fully responsible for our nation’s finances. The last surplus budget was the 2007-08 budget, which was the last budget that was crafted by the Howard-Costello government. Since then we have had a $27 billion deficit in 2008-09, a $54.8 billion deficit in 2009-10 and we are looking at an estimated $41.5 billion deficit this year. We are looking at $94.4 billion worth of net debt. Presumably, if the government have a chance to continue in government that will be only the start.</para>
<para>Compare and contrast this with our record in government. When we were in government we had surplus after surplus. We paid off debt and we implemented income tax cut after income tax cut. Labor fail on all of these grounds.</para>
<para>Labor would say, ‘Our circumstances are more difficult. We have been faced with a global financial crisis and now we are being faced with what are very tragic events in Queensland.’ The events in Queensland are tragic and all Australians should and will pull together to rebuild and to take Queensland and Australia forward again. Of course, that will happen, but we should also put it all into context.</para>
<para>These are tragic events but Australia has faced tragic events in the past. In fact, Australia has faced tragic events under the previous coalition government. Under the Howard government we had the Asian financial crisis, we had all of the events related to the war on terror, the Bali bombings, record droughts, the tsunami in Indonesia, avian flu, the ACT bushfires—an extraordinary tragedy that happened back in 2003—Cyclone Larry and various bushfires in Victoria and South Australia in 2005.</para>
<para>Madam Acting Deputy President, do you think that the response at that time was to whack on another tax? No, it was not. When you have a good government and a strong fiscal position, when you have a government that lives within its means and when you have a government that knows that it has got to balance the books and have a surplus, then you are able to handle the challenges you face as they come along.</para>
<para>The best insurance and the best way to inoculate yourself against the fall-out from these sorts of tragic events is to have a strong surplus. This is the great failure of this government. This government has mismanaged our nation’s finances to such an extent over the last three years that we are now in a position where they think the only way that they can keep some sort of semblance of fiscal responsibility is to whack on one tax after another.</para>
<para>Let us look at some of their track record. We had the response to the global financial crisis. The then Prime Minister, Kevin Rudd, and Wayne Swan clearly panicked. They looked at what was happening in the US and the UK. They noted there was fiscal stimulus happening over there: ‘Let’s go and spend like drunken sailors because that’s what they are doing in the US and the UK. So we should go down the fiscal stimulus path.’ Never mind that the circumstances in Australia were very different from the circumstances in the US and the UK.</para>
<para>In the US and the UK interest rates were close to zero. They were printing money and the governments over there thought there was still further stimulus required so off they went with fiscal stimulus. In Australia our interest rates bottomed out at three per cent. The Reserve Bank did a great job. They reduced interest rates very rapidly from 7.25 per cent down to three per cent. If further stimulus was required there was still scope for monetary policy to achieve it.</para>
<para>But what have we got now? We have a circumstance where the Reserve Bank and the government are going in opposite directions. We have had seven successive interest rate rises from the Reserve Bank at the same time as this government continue to shuffle money out of the door, so the government continue to stimulate the economy with taxpayers’ money and they continue to push the accelerator while the Reserve Bank is applying the brakes. So the Reserve Bank is putting up interest rates to reduce the supply of money in the market and this incompetent, wasteful government continues to put the money out the door.</para>
<para>It is quite rare to have fiscal policy and monetary policy going in opposite directions to the extent that we have experienced it in Australia over the last 18 months. This government would not know what a tax hike was if it fell over one. We have had more than $40 billion worth of tax hikes over the last three years. And what did the Prime Minister say on <inline font-style="italic">Meet the Press</inline> on Sunday? She said that over the last three years since 2007 ‘we have implemented more than $80 billion worth of savings’. Madam Acting Deputy President, I am sure that you would have been as surprised as I was to look at the fine detail and see more than half of the $80 billion worth of savings claimed by this dishonest Prime Minister were actually tax hikes. More than $40 billion of the things that this Prime Minister claims as savings are increased or new taxes. They include such pearlers as the increased alcopops tax, the tax that Labor gave us because they said it would reduce binge drinking and the tax that Labor said was going to reduce the consumption of alcopops. All the while, when Treasury were in the background assessing the revenue from that alcopops tax hike they were actually working on the assumption that consumption was going to go up—as it has since. This is the sort of dishonest tax-grabbing type of rhetoric that we get from this government: ‘Tell them that we want to reduce binge drinking while all the time we expect that binge drinking is actually going to go up.’</para>
<para>We have the tax on the North West Shelf and the luxury car tax, which was supposed to be on Maserati drivers and Porsche drivers—never mind that they were a direct tax hit on families with station wagons. We have the mining tax, the carbon tax and now we have another increase in the income tax hit on people across Australia. Why? To raise $1.8 billion to address the fallout from the tragic events up in North Queensland.</para>
<para>A government that has its finances in order and under control is able to deal with these challenges without having to whack on yet another ad hoc tax. It is time that this government took a strategic view of our tax system. It is time that this government delivered on its promise to have a tax summit by June. We were promised a tax summit by the end of June—that is four months away—to discuss openly, transparently and inclusively our tax system moving forward, a fairer, simpler tax system and lower taxes. Wayne Swan, the Treasurer, is running away from it. He does not want to have a tax summit. He does not want to be forced into a strategic look at taxation reform because he wants to continue with ad hoc tax grab after ad hoc tax grab to feed his addiction to spending, to help him cover up the mismanagement of the public finances after three years of Labor. It is high time that a good and strong government took over the Treasury benches so that the finances can be brought back under control. It is not enough for you to put John Fahey in charge of one of your programs to fix up your whole government. It is time that you put Tony Abbott in charge of the whole shop.</para>

<para>—There are moments when you know the opposition just want to play politics, when they oppose for opposition’s sake, as they have constantly been doing, or because they think they can make some political gain out of an issue. When they argue against a sensible proposal for a modest temporary levy that will contribute to the plan of the government to rebuild after the devastation that has hit Queensland, we know that this is one of those moments. I can tell you now that the people of Australia are much smarter than that. They will see—and have seen—right through the opportunism of Tony Abbott because they can see the cracks that are already appearing in the coalition ranks over this issue. Australia has just gone through one of the biggest natural disasters in its history, if not the biggest. Prime Minister Julia Gillard has shown strength and leadership and responded decisively to the crisis and those on the other side are just playing politics once again, even though it involves the loss of the worldly goods of people, their homes, their businesses, all their infrastructure and government infrastructure. The coalition do not care. They are just off having a good time playing politics and opposing for the sake of opposing.</para>
</talk.start>
<para>The Australian government has already provided $400 million in disaster assistance. We estimate that the total cost of recovery and rebuilding will be in the order $5.6 billion. That consists of $5 billion for rebuilding essential infrastructure—the word there being essential—and $600 million in Australian government disaster recovery payments to be paid to nearly half a million Australians, including people in my home state of Tasmania who have been affected by floods on the east and north-west coasts. Also important to my home state, given the fact that a number of farmers have been affected by the floods, are payments under the disaster income recovery subsidy. This will provide $120 million in assistance to around 70,000 workers, small businesses and farmers who have lost income through the floods.</para>
<para>I just take this opportunity to thank the Tasmanian government for their hardship assistance through grants to help with temporary living expenses, the replacement of damaged and destroyed household items and the re-establishment of homes for people in Tasmania. The Australian government is also assisting employers in flood affected areas by fast-tracking employer sponsored temporary visas and doubling the number of places in the job seeker relocation pilot program. Two-thirds of the cost borne by the government will be met through budget savings and the remainder through a modest, temporary levy.</para>
<para>The coalition are linking this levy to cost-of-living pressures to try to make out that it is going to be some huge impost on Australian taxpayers. They know full well that 50 per cent of taxpayers will pay nothing, including people earning under $50,000 a year, and people who are paid or are eligible for an Australian government disaster relief payment will pay nothing. As for those who do pay the levy, a person on average full-time earnings—or $68,125 per year—will pay only an extra $1.74 per week. The same people have had their income tax bill cut by $20 per week by this government. Even those on $80,000 a year will pay about $2.80 per week, which is less than the cost of a cup of coffee. So this levy is modest, it is progressive, and surely it is a small price to pay to ensure that we rebuild our vital infrastructure destroyed by natural disasters.</para>
<para>If there is any better indication that those opposite are playing politics on this issue it is their record in government. Where does this sudden opposition to levies come from? After all, the Howard government introduced no more than six special levies during its time in power. As Senator Cormann said himself, if a government can manage its budgets it does not have to introduce these new levies. But it had no problem in introducing six special levies during its time in power. For those on the other side of the chamber with short memories, I will remind you what they were: the aircraft noise levy, introduced in the 1995-96 budget to fund amelioration of noise at airports; a 0.2 per cent increase in the Medicare levy to fund the firearms buyback scheme in 1996-97; the stevedoring levy in the 1998-99 budget applying to the loading and unloading of containers to ensure that employees made redundant under the Maritime Restructuring Facilitation Scheme received their full entitlements; the dairy industry adjustment levy to provide assistance to the industry to cope with deregulation; the Ansett levy imposed on air passenger tickets to fund a special entitlements scheme for former Ansett employees; and the sugar industry levy to fund industry assistance programs for the sugar industry.</para>
<para>In fact I think the memories of those opposite are especially short because it was only during the last federal election that the Leader of the Opposition proposed a levy to fund their maternity leave scheme. It was a scheme that they were happy to support, mind you, that would pay the wages of women on incomes of $150,000 a year in full. They were happy to support that but not happy to help out their fellow Australians in times of natural crises. I find it very funny how that was deemed worthy of a levy back in 2010, but now that we are in 2011 the coalition opposes a levy to help rebuild infrastructure following—from what we have heard today and as we all know—what is arguably Australia’s biggest natural disaster. The coalition obviously thought levies were okay in 1996 and 2001 and even as late as in 2010. But now that we are in 2011 the coalition has somehow decided that they are opposed to levies.</para>
<para>What is the coalition’s alternative? They are going to come up with a proposal for another $1.8 billion worth of savings, or so they say. But why would you trust them when it comes to budget management? They are the same group that, if they had formed government, would have left Australia with an $11 billion budget black hole. You would not put that lot in charge of the cash tin at the local bridge club let alone the federal Treasury. Let’s look at who is in charge of budget policy in the coalition: the opposition leader, Tony Abbott; the shadow Treasurer, Joe Hockey; and the shadow finance minister, Andrew Robb. They are the same three stooges who blew out their 2010 election costings by $11 billion. I think the coalition could have got better advice from their family accountant than from Messrs Abbott, Hockey or Robb.</para>
<para>As a further demonstration of Mr Abbott’s ignorance of fiscal policy he suggested that scrapping the National Broadband Network would help pay for the cost of recovery and rebuilding. He had to back down and concede that one pretty quickly as his argument was flawed because he did not take into account the financial returns from the NBN investment. Mr Abbott’s next gaffe was to claim, on 28 January, that there is $8 billion available in various funds including the Building Australia Fund which is currently uncommitted. This was exposed as a con, and rightly so. But the absolute height of Mr Abbott’s gall was when he emailed Liberal Party supporters and called for donations to fight the flood tax. At a time when many Australians are digging deep to help those suffering from natural disasters Mr Abbott was thinking about what to do to fill the Liberal Party coffers. Where are his priorities?</para>
<para>The coalition have now said they will identify $1.8 billion worth of savings. Since that announcement they have spent a fortnight squabbling over what to cut. In their press conference yesterday Mr Abbott and Mr Hockey could not even agree on the numbers. Their ridiculous savings policy is already unravelling. For example, the Leader of the Nationals, Warren Truss, rejected all of the deferred infrastructure programs in Queensland as pork-barrelling, yet Tony Abbott supported the deferral of three of these projects. It is becoming increasingly obvious to all Australians that the biggest risk to our policy of achieving a budget surplus by 2012-13 would be in accepting any suggestions put forward by those fiscal dunces opposite.</para>
<para>The rhetoric of Mr Abbott and his coalition colleagues is highly hypocritical. If they want to point to a high-taxing, high-spending government then they should take a good look at themselves. This financial year our tax take is only 20.9 per cent of gross domestic product. In not one single financial year of the 11 years of the Howard government did the tax take drop below 22.1 per cent of GDP. The opposition should stop making petty political points and they should get on and support this levy because it is in the interests of the nation. If they continue to cling to their dodgy accounting it will only serve to demonstrate one thing. <inline font-style="italic">(Time expired)</inline>

<para>—This is supposed to be a serious debate, but after hearing the last speaker one would very much doubt that. I tried to table, and at the end of my speech will again seek permission to table, a list of major cyclonic and other natural disasters that have occurred in our country since 1864. That list will show that every year there are one or two cyclones, one or two major flood events and continuing droughts. Never before in any of those cyclones, floods or droughts has any Australian government ever imposed a tax on infrastructure recovery. Why is that? It is because that is the normal function of government. The normal function of government is to deal with these natural calamities that everybody knows will confront our nation at some time in any one year or series of years.</para>
</talk.start>
<para>I can go through this list and tell you some of the major cyclone events that I have had the misfortune to be involved in. There was Cyclone Agnes in 1956, a cyclone that came across Ayr where I lived in 1957 and Cyclone Beatrice in 1959. In fact there was also Cyclone Connie and another cyclone further north all in the one year. Was there any levy by the then Australian government to pay for the rebuilding of those towns? Was there ever any levy for rebuilding Darwin when it was flattened by a cyclone? Was there ever any levy for Cyclone Larry rebuilding? There was not because these rebuilding efforts by governments are part of the natural services of government. Any prudent government—and even prudent Labor governments in the past—has been able to manage infrastructure repair without the imposition of a levy.</para>
<para>It is important to make those who may be listening to this debate aware that the money from Labor’s proposed new tax is not going to go to individuals to help assuage some of the personal hurt that many people have suffered as a result of these floods, cyclones and fires. It is not going to go towards rebuilding houses or replacing refrigerators or getting a new wardrobe for those people who have lost everything; it is to go to state governments, mainly state Labor governments I regret to say, for them to do the repair work that is part of their normal activity of government. This levy is not going to go to individuals—and this needs to be made very clear—it is simply going to go to state Labor governments and other governments to do the work that those governments would normally be expected to do.</para>
<para>The previous speaker, Senator Bilyk, accused the coalition of playing politics. This is certainly an issue where politics should not be played. But let me tell you about the Labor Party. There was a devastating flood in Queensland, with the loss of life. What did the Queensland Premier do? She established the Premier’s flood relief fund. The Premier started that fund off with the Premier donating, I think, $1 million. Sorry, Premier Bligh, you did not give a $1 million donation. I and every other Queensland taxpayer donated $1 million. The flood relief fund is not the Premier’s flood relief fund; it is the Queensland people’s flood relief fund. Yet the coalition is accused by the Labor Party of playing politics, when the basest form of politics has been played by the Labor Party in this whole episode.</para>
<para>Senator Bilyk, who spoke before me, said, ‘This levy is for only one year.’ Can you believe the Labor Party imposing any tax for just one year? Let me remind you that, before the last federal election, Ms Gillard got on the soapbox, hand on heart, and said, ‘There will be no carbon tax.’ And, as a result of that assurance, many people who were a bit hesitant about voting for the new taxes that the Labor Party is so addicted to, took her at her word. They said, ‘We’re a bit uncertain, but she’s promised no new taxes, so we’ll vote for her.’ Those people rightly feel that they have been conned. They voted for Julia Gillard because she promised not to impose a tax and, within a couple of weeks of becoming Prime Minister, after a dirty deal with the Greens and the Independents, she said, ‘We’re going to have a carbon tax.’</para>
<para>Can you believe the Labor Party then when it says, ‘This levy will be for only one year?’ Nobody believes that. Not even senators sitting opposite would believe that. They know that the Labor Party is addicted to spending other people’s money—never their own—and it is addicted to taxing people to pay for their profligacy in these areas. You simply cannot trust Labor with money.</para>
<para>The most common comment I had from people in my electorate—before, after and during the cyclone—was to the effect, ‘When the flood came along and the public appeal went out, we donated money. Because of the extent of the flood we were even more generous than (a) we could afford to be, or (b) we have ever been before.’ Here was a major flood. The altruism of the Australian public came to the fore, and they said, ‘We will give till it hurts, because this is a huge disaster and the appeal will help individuals overcome their problems.’ Many people have told me the amount of money they gave—amounts that I know those people cannot really afford, but they wanted to give them. But, after being so generous, they then find that the Labor government comes in and double dips. It taxes them again for the same sort of generosity that they themselves showed. This is what is really annoying people. That is why, when you take a real survey—not the survey that was in the newspapers, which asked: would you support a levy to help people get over the flood?—and ask people, ‘Are you prepared to pay a levy to help state governments do the things that they are supposed to do, when you the public have already given very generously to help people?’ you find that most people are totally opposed to this levy. And they do not trust Labor with money.</para>
<para>I would remind you again that, a couple of weeks before the election, hand on heart, Julia Gillard, on behalf of the Labor Party, said, ‘There will be no carbon tax. I promise; trust me. When I say things, I mean them.’ Two weeks after the election, she said, ‘Yes, we’re going to have a carbon tax.’ Why would you believe the Labor Party? Why would you believe Julia Gillard when she says, ‘This levy will be for only one year.’ You can be assured that this is another form of taxation.</para>
<para>The Howard government were renowned for cutting taxation on individuals year after year. By contrast, the Labor Party are back, consistent with their old form, increasing taxation year after year. This proposed flood levy is simply part of Labor’s DNA: they must tax more to pay for their profligacy.</para>

<para>—As a Queensland senator, I rise today in this debate to refute Senator Fifield’s motion about the Gillard government’s continued mismanagement of public finances and intention to compound cost-of-living pressures on families by introducing a new income tax levy. Firstly, this motion is misleading. The federal government is not compounding the cost-of-living pressures on families with an income tax levy. It surprises me that a senator from Victoria, Senator Fifield, who I am sure has seen and witnessed the terrible flood devastation in his state, has put this motion here today. I am sure he is well aware of the national disasters that have happened and are happening around our nation, which include bushfires over in your state, Acting Deputy President Pratt, and flooding and a huge cyclone up in the north of my state of Queensland. Thousands of people have been impacted by the Queensland floods and Cyclone Yasi. Many lost everything that they owned. Along with personal loss, there was also public loss. Roads, bridges and rail lines were destroyed. Vital infrastructure that is imperative for Queenslanders to make a living was destroyed. This is what the temporary flood levy will address.

<para>—We will get to that in a minute, Senator Macdonald. The temporary flood levy, which will be only collected in the 2011-12 financial year, will go towards rebuilding Queensland infrastructure that was destroyed by the worst natural disaster we have seen in this country. The one-off levy will be payable by those who earn more than $50,000 per year at the rate of 0.5 cents. This equates to less than 50 cents a week for someone who earns $55,000 and less than $1 a week for those on $60,000. Those who earn more than $100,000 will pay one per cent. That is why the opposition opposes this levy: they are worried about their business mates; they are worried about those people who earn over $100,000. That is the only reason that they are standing up here today opposing this levy.</para>
</talk.start>
</continue>
<para>No extra work will be required by Australians for the collection of this levy. It will be paid in the same way as the Medicare levy. Australian residents who have claimed the Australian government disaster recovery payment will be exempt from paying the flood levy. This will give them the opportunity to rebuild their lives after these devastating natural disasters.</para>
<para>The opposition’s scurrilously claims that this levy will push up the cost of living for our families. This levy is 10 times less than the tax cuts Australians have received over the last three years. The Labor government is committed to providing tax cuts for our working Australians. In fact, the former Liberal government was the highest taxing government in our history. Our very own opposition leader, Mr Abbott, along with his Treasury spokesman, Joe Hockey, supported the implementation of the highest tax rate of 24.1 per cent in 2004-05 and 2005-06. Under the Gillard government, the tax rate will only be at 20.9 per cent. Since taking office, we have delivered personal income tax cuts in each of our three budgets. Our tax reforms have cut company tax, cut small business tax, reduced tax on superannuation, reduced tax on other savings and reduced tax for taxpayers through a standard deduction. Conversely, the opposition has been sceptical of the flood levy since day one. This flood levy is needed to get my state of Queensland back on its feet. This is no surprise, as Tony Abbott has been programmed to automatically oppose anything that the Labor government suggests.</para>
<para>I am pleased that Senator Macdonald raised those issues up in North Queensland. Being a Queenslander and having travelled, worked and holidayed in those regions, I understand the impact on regional and northern Queensland. But he fails to understand the overall coverage of this particular disaster. It was a disaster the size of the United Kingdom. None of the cyclones that Senator Macdonald raised in his speech were even close to that size.</para>
<para>The government levy will be used to rebuild infrastructure vital to people earning a living. Without roads, bridges and railway lines, Australians are unable to continue their employment and businesses are unable to function. With no access to their places of employment, those supporting families will find it tough to sustain their day-to-day lives. Without an income, families will struggle to put food on the table. This is what the opposition is supporting by opposing this needed levy. Without this flood levy, our roads, bridges and railways cannot be rebuilt. If you went back and reflected on those media images on the TV just last week after Cyclone Yasi hit North Queensland, you would understand and appreciate the volume of the impact on railways and roads. The bitumen on roads was shifted off the strips that are relied upon for transport. And this opposition opposes rebuilding infrastructure in the north of Queensland and other parts of the state.</para>
<para>The opposition is determined to deny flood and cyclone affected Queenslanders this assistance, even though it has been found that the public support this levy. Senator Macdonald mentioned a survey that the <inline font-style="italic">Australian</inline> released just last week, the latest Newspoll. It showed that 55 per cent support this levy to help rebuild flood affected areas. If you rely on some of your surveys, naturally you would come up with a different figure, because that suits your purpose. But this is what Australians do. The community spirit that I experienced during the Brisbane flood was amazing. People who were not affected by the floods got out their gumboots, their brooms and their hats and set out to assist people who they had never met. Donations to the Premier’s diaster relief appeal were extraordinary, with everyday Australians digging deep to support fellow Australians left devastated after the floods. As of yesterday, $205 million has been raised by this appeal. And people are still committed to raising money for this appeal, because the money is going to people who need it. This levy is to support the rebuilding of infrastructure in the state of Queensland. The support of the public for this levy shows exactly what the community spirit is like in this country. I believe that the majority of Australians will be willing to give up a cup of coffee a week to help rebuild our flood affected areas.</para>

<para>—Or less. I take that interjection, Senator Bilyk. Tony Abbott had no problems in his election promises with implementing a levy on big business to fund paid parental leave last year, but he is not prepared to support a levy on Australians who earn more than $50,000 to help rebuild our flood affected areas. In fact, he commented in the <inline font-style="italic">Herald Sun</inline> on 13 March last year—note the contradiction:</para>
</talk.start>

<para>The difference between a levy and a tax is that a levy is for a specific purpose and this is for a specific purpose.</para>

<para class="block">This is exactly what our proposal for a levy is all about. His hypocrisy is so stark in this debate. This week Tony Abbott announced his alternative to the flood levy—in fact, you would describe it as his own personal view, with his own opposition cabinet members disagreeing on one of his proposals: to cut foreign aid to Africa.</para>
<para>Despite the flood and cyclone crisis Treasurer Wayne Swan has confirmed that the budget is still on track and is to be in surplus by 2012-13. It is through the federal government’s financial discipline and great economic management during the global financial crisis that we will put the budget back in the black. In the Treasurer’s economic note of 23 January Mr Swan revealed the labour force figures showing that the unemployment rate fell from 5.2 per cent to five per cent in December. In fact, 2010 was a record, with 364,000 jobs created—and 80 per cent of those were filled by full-time positions.</para>
<para>Third parties, including the Business Council of Australia, have also praised our economic management. The BCA stated in its budget submission in 2009-10:</para>

<para>The BCA considers that the government has so far responded well to the downturn in the economy and to the issues related to the global financial crisis. The BCA welcomes recent policy decisions by the government that have redirected spending towards building capacity and longterm growth.</para>
</quote>
<para class="block">So this government, the Labor government, will act swiftly and appropriately with this particular levy and this particular natural disaster.</para>
<para>In closing, the opposition had another blow recently. The opposition leader came out recently, at a time when Queenslanders are recovering from the greatest natural disaster this country has ever faced, trying to deal with their flood-inundated homes, protecting themselves from the greatest cyclone Queensland has ever faced, and commenced his mudslinging routine. He should hang his head in shame, do the honourable thing and resign. I am sure that those opposite will make sure that happens as soon as possible.</para>

<para>—Following the rather laborious contribution from Senator Furner, I was taken back to 1967, when Shirley Bassey sang that immortal number, ‘Hey big spender’, because it seems to have crept back into the Labor government’s vocabulary. The only thing they have contributed to this debate has been trying to mount a justification for taking more money out of the pockets of families. We have to ask about the integrity of their arguments. Senator Bilyk said that this government was a much lower-taxing government than those that went before it, and she quoted a percentage of GDP. What seems to have escaped Senator Bilyk and her colleagues is that they have spent $150 billion more than they have taken in tax, which has mortgaged the futures of our children. It has placed an impediment upon every Australian family. They are going to have to repay the debt that has been established by this government.</para>
</talk.start>
<para>The proposition we are debating today is very simple. It is that the mismanagement of the Gillard government of public finances will compound the cost-of-living pressures on families. It is a very simple proposition. It is very simple because the Australian people know about the cost-of-living pressures on families. It is a bit harder to understand it if you do not have a family of your own, because you are not there trying to put food on the table for your children. You are not there trying to pay for child care or living on one income. You cannot understand it until you have to live it. The fact that this government are defending their squandering of public money and saying that imposing a new tax on Australian families is not going to make it harder for them beggars belief. How can a government be so uncaring?</para>
<para>The government dress up their spendthrift manner, and their demands on the taxpayers’ purse, by talking about the disasters that have befallen Queensland, and they try to play an emotive card. It is very serious what has happened in Queensland. It is going to cost billions to repair it. But they are billions that we would have had they not been wasted through foolish programs, mismanagement and economic incompetence. If you need any further proof, I could give you four words: ‘pink batts’ and ‘school halls’. They have now entered the Australian vernacular as synonyms for waste and stupidity. That is what they mean. Every time you mention pink batts and school halls, people know that that was waste and stupidity at work. And yet those on the other side of the chamber have not been prepared to say this is a problem. They walk around, Mr Swan and the others, in their Mr Magoo like world that rules their fiscal calculations, talking about inflation being at 2.7 per cent. The reality is that the cost-of-living rises for families are much higher than that. Already, economists at Westpac have said that fruit and vegetable prices could rise by up to 60 per cent in the months ahead. We are seeing fuel prices much higher than they have been. We are seeing electricity prices in my state of South Australia up 12 per cent. And, due to the mismanagement in New South Wales, they are going to go up 50 per cent.</para>
<para>All of these things are going to hurt families, and yet the Gillard government says, ‘I don’t want to know about it; we want people to reach into their pockets and pluck out another one per cent.’ That money, the $6 billion or $8 billion or whatever it costs, should have been available through the government budgetary office already. The reason for that is simple: this government were left with a $20 billion surplus. They sent it out to people in $900 cheques. They then went into the pink batts and school halls. They then put up taxes—which, of course, were not going to affect working families; but they were taxes on cigarettes, on ready-to-drink alcohol, on family cars. We forget about that. There were increased taxes, or lower rebates, for private health insurance. This government, and those opposite, have never met a tax they did not like. They can justify it in any number of ways, but every time they do they drive another stake through the heart of Australian families. They are already doing it tough, and you want to make it tougher for them, all because you are not prepared to admit you have got it wrong, you have bungled our national finances.</para>
<para>I come back to my opening remarks. This is going to force Australian families for at least a generation to labour under the yoke of your mismanagement. It is incredible how much damage can be done in only three years of government. It is much more damage than was caused by the biggest floods we have seen in 30 years in Queensland, much more damage than was caused by a massive cyclone in Queensland and much more damage than was caused by bushfires in Victoria or in Western Australia. The human cost of the tragedy that you are imposing on this country should have you hanging your heads in shame. It is an absolute disaster and all because you cannot—your party, your government—manage money.</para>
<para>This is a very simple premise: the Australian people expect governments to step in and help them through times of crisis. They do not expect the government to create a crisis in only three short but very painful years that is going to cost not only this generation but successive generations and make them pay. After squandering a massive surplus and accruing a record debt, which it conveniently seems to have forgotten, this Labor government is intent on imposing additional taxes. It does not want to impose just a flood levy—let us get past that for a moment—but additional taxes such as a carbon tax which it swore it would never impose; a carbon tax which Ms Gillard swore, hand on heart, ‘I will not impose’, but now she is going to impose; a carbon tax that is unnecessary, except for the fact that the government wants to take more control of people’s lives and take more money out of their pockets. It is going to put up the price of everything for families, and there is nothing the government can say to refute that because it knows it is true. But that is not all, that is not enough. It does not want to just impose a carbon tax; it also wants to impose a mining tax to make mining companies less profitable so that, possibly, there will be less exploration, less investment and less development of mines in this country, which will mean less employment. And if there are fewer people working, you know that that is going to have an impact on families.</para>
<para>For this government, mining is just a golden goose that can continue to be plucked. The government want to pluck the people that work in that industry as well, many of whom earn over $100,000 and would not consider themselves wealthy. Yet Senator Furner said that those who are earning over $100,000 a year are the fat cats and the business magnates—I am paraphrasing here. The simple fact is that the government have targeted people who want to work. Because of their incompetence, the government want to take more out of their pockets. They do not have a plan to balance the budget. I was told before that wagering in the chamber is un-Senate like, but I would lay London to a brick that this government will not ever deliver a surplus, and certainly not by 2013, unless they continue to tax and impose levy after levy.</para>
<para>I do not want to see the burden go up for Australian taxpayers and their families. I do not want to see them have increased pressure on their family budgets. Might I remind senators that families have to live within their means. They do not have a bottomless pit of credit and they do not have access to a compliant legislature. They have to live within their means and if they spend too much money in one area they have to go without in another. That is what every family in this country does, yet the people that we should trust the most to balance the budget and to ensure that people live within their means, the Australian government, cannot seem to do so.</para>
<para> What is it about having $300 billion a year to spend that causes people to spend $400 billion or $500 billion? What is it that causes people, when they come up to this place as part of the ALP, to close their eyes to the impact on working families? They talk, they issue rhetoric and they make promises, but when they get up here they suddenly forget what it is like—what it is like to go to the shop and have to spend twice as much money to buy some bananas or what it is like to put fruit and vegetables on the table. A 60 per cent price increase is expected in the months ahead. What does this government respond with? They respond by saying, ‘We are going to take more money out of your pocket and make it harder for you, every Australian family that is going to be hit by this levy, to pay your bills.’ It is not over yet. We are opposed to this because it is unnecessary. It is unnecessary because this is the most wasteful government in the history of this country.</para>

<para>—There he goes, the apologist for West Australian big business is in there again, intervening in the debate. I think the public are not interested in the position that you are adopting. The public want Queensland rebuilt, they want northern New South Wales rebuilt, they want Victoria rebuilt—they want recovery from these disasters—and they want Western Australia rebuilt from the fires that are in that state. As Senator Cormann has said, a government that has its finances under control does not need a levy. Let me have a look at some of the levies that the Howard government put on.</para>
</talk.start>
</continue>
<para>The stevedoring levy: obviously no finances were under control by the Howard government when the stevedoring levy went on in 1998. The dairy levy: obviously you did not have your finances under control when you implemented the dairy levy in 2001. You had a surplus of $3.9 billion in 1998-99 when you put a levy on. You had a surplus in 2001 when you put a levy on. No wonder, Senator Cormann, you are walking out of the Senate, because you cannot accept that the reality of what you have just said exposes the nonsense that you have been putting forward in relation to your arguments. You put on an airport levy at a time when there was a surplus of $5.9 billion. You put on a sugar levy when there was a surplus of $7.4 billion. Peter Costello was lying back in his hammock, rocking away watching the money flooding in and John Howard was thrown out every budget on bribes to the public—that is the nature of the so-called fiscal responsibility of the Howard government.</para>
<para>Senator Cormann leaves the chamber because he just does not want to hear the reality of what the Howard government did. They had a superannuation surcharge levy, a gun buyback levy, a stevedoring levy, a milk levy, a sugar levy, an Ansett Airlines levy. They were proposing an East Timor levy. They were proposing a cleaner fuels levy. Yet they have got the gall to come in here and argue with us when we are proposing a one-off 12-month levy to rebuild this country after one of the biggest natural disasters we have ever seen. What a performance it has been from Senators Macdonald, Cormann and Bernardi. What a performance! Senator Macdonald in his usual petty, narrow minded, bitter way was trying to turn a natural disaster into an attack on a government that is determined to rebuild Queensland.</para>
<para>Senator Cormann, as I have said, is the Senate apologist for big business, the Senate apologist for big mining and the Senate apologist for big health. He was in here saying that we should not put a levy on—a modest levy to rebuild this country, to rebuild Queensland, northern New South Wales and Victoria. You see, Senator Cormann has been clear in his position. As long as Western Australia is doing all right, it does not matter about anywhere else. He is simply focused on Western Australia and on sucking up to the big mining lobby in Western Australia so that the Liberal Party of Western Australia can still maintain the money coming in so that it can maintain control within the Liberal Party of Australia. That is what Senator Cormann is about. Let’s not make any bones about what he is about. He is about big business and he is about the Liberal Party—the same as the Leader of the Opposition.</para>

<para>—Senator Cormann is a big sook. He is so weak, so full of bluster and bluff, yet when it comes down to it he has to get the chair to help him in a debate in this Senate. What a pathetic performance. When the public have listened to those three Liberal senators, they will wonder what they are on about. The reality is that the priority for any government—it should be for any opposition—is to get the recovery of this nation underway. Yet what we see the Liberal Party doing is looking at this recovery on the basis of saying, ‘Well, we can actually get some benefit out of this. Let’s put a release out and say, “Give us some money to oppose the levy.”’ When everyone else in the country is putting money in to support Queensland, northern New South Wales, Victoria and now Western Australia, what does the Leader of the Opposition do? The Leader of the Opposition is out there saying, ‘Don’t worry about the levy; don’t worry about putting money in to support the people of Australia that are in trouble—just think about giving more money to the Liberal Party.’</para>
</talk.start>
</continue>
<para>Talk about impugning your motives! I think you have demonstrated quite clearly what your motives are. You are a pathetic rabble. What is happening at the moment is that Tony Abbott’s pasting-over of the differences between the Liberal Party and the National Party is coming apart. We all know that the Liberal Party detests the National Party. We know that the National Party detests the Liberal Party. And we know that those in the Liberal Party detest each other. That is what is driving the response to what should be the most important matter facing any political party in this country, and that is getting the recovery of this nation underway. That is the important thing—the recovery of this nation.</para>
<para>What has been clearly demonstrated by the contributions from the three previous senators is that all they want to do is try to score narrow, meaningless political points when our government is setting about in a decisive manner to repair the damage to this nation and to look after Queensland, New South Wales, Western Australia and Victoria. That is what we will do. We will not be diverted by your petty political points. We will get on with building this nation. We are a government that are always turned to when there is a problem. We handled the financial crisis; we will handle this crisis.</para>

<motion>
<para>That the Senate take note of the report.</para>
</motion>
<para class="block">The committee is looking forward to a new year of scrutinising all bills and amendments against its terms of reference.</para>
<para>In 2011 the committee will continue to emphasise the importance of ensuring personal rights and liberties are respected, that administrative powers are appropriately defined, decisions are reviewable and parliamentary oversight is maintained.</para>
<para>The committee reiterates that comprehensive and accurate explanatory memoranda can provide the foundation for avoiding adverse comment by the committee, but a poorly drafted one will attract the committee’s attention. An explanatory memorandum is particularly useful when it contains important context and relevant policy information and justifies the proposed operation of each provision.</para>
<para>In tabling the committee’s <inline font-style="italic">Alert Digest</inline> No. 1 of 2011 I particularly draw the Senate’s attention to the committee’s comments on the National Vocational Education and Training Regulator Bill. Unfortunately this bill has attracted significant committee concern. The committee is particularly troubled by the range of seemingly excessive powers and the apparent lack of appropriate safeguards. The committee will be seeking the minister’s advice about numerous provisions, including in relation to the operation of search warrant provisions, the abrogation of the privilege against self-incrimination in some circumstances, broad discretionary powers and the adequacy of training for ‘authorised officers’.</para>
<para>Another issue of particular concern to the committee discussed in <inline font-style="italic">Alert Digest</inline> No. 1 arises from the Human Services Legislation Amendment Bill. Items 74 and 76 seek to reduce Medicare’s obligation to notify a patient that his or her records have been seized as part of an investigation. It is proposed that there will no longer be a need to notify patients in circumstances where an officer examines a record but ‘did not obtain any knowledge of clinical details relating to the patient’.</para>
<para>The committee is particularly interested to understand who will determine whether clinical knowledge was obtained, what training each officer will have and whether any safeguards are in place to protect patients and will seek the minister’s advice about these matters.</para>
<para>Several other bills also contain issues of potential concern under standing order 24 and I draw the Senate’s attention to all of the committee’s comments in <inline font-style="italic">Alert Digest</inline> No. 1.</para>
<para>In relation to its first report, the committee has again received comprehensive responses to issues raised in previous <inline font-style="italic">Alert Digest</inline>s. The report includes the minister’s response, for example, to the Defence Legislation (Security of Premises) Bill issues, which provides further detail about the intended operation of the bill which may be of assistance to senators in their consideration of it.</para>
<para>So there is a fair bit in this particular report. I commend <inline font-style="italic">Alert Digest</inline> No. 1 of 2011 and the first report of 2011 to the Senate.</para>

<para class="block">Mr President, on behalf of the Joint Committee of Public Accounts and Audit, I present the Committee’s Report 418: Review of Auditor-General’s Reports Nos. 04 to 38 (2009-10) and Report 419: Inquiry into the Auditor-General Act 1997.</para>
<para class="block">These reports are tabled on behalf of the Committee of the previous Parliament, which undertook all of the work for the inquiries, including the conduct of the public hearings and the preparation of the reports.</para>
<para class="block">With regard to Report 418, the Joint Committee of Public Accounts and Audit, as prescribed by its Act, examines all reports of the Auditor-General, and reports the results of the Committee’s deliberations to the Parliament.</para>
<para class="block">This report details the findings of the Committee’s examination of nine performance audits tabled in 2009 and 2010. As usual, these reports cover a range of agencies and highlight a number of areas of concern, in particular grants administration, the implementation of new technology, risk management and data integrity.</para>
<para class="block">The Committee reviewed the administration of grants by the National Health and Medical Research Council (NHMRC). The Committee acknowledged the benefits to Australian health flowing from research supported by the NHMRC grants system. The Committee also noted the upheaval caused by the NHMRC’s recent separation from the Department of Health and its move to a statutory agency. The Committee recognised that NHMRC is still consolidating its new status but was pleased to see evidence of a tightening in administrative practices, processes and procedure.</para>
<para class="block">The Committee examined the implementation of the Change Program by the Australian Taxation Office. While the Committee noted the significant productivity gains within the Tax Office, it expressed concern about the extent of ongoing client dissatisfaction with the system and the undermining of confidence in the integrity of Australia’s taxation system. The incoming Committee will continue to monitor this situation at the next Biannual Hearing with the Taxation Commissioner.</para>
<para class="block">The Committee also expressed concern over the long term issue of staff churn at AusAID, particularly in light of the growing demands placed on the agency by Australia’s expanding aid program. The Committee acknowledged that AusAID is taking positive steps to combat this issue and recommended that AusAID report back to the JCPAA on its efforts to alleviate the problem.</para>
<para class="block">The Committee reviewed audit reports on a number of controversial topics including the National Broadband Network request for proposal process, the coordination and reporting of Australia’s climate change measures and the Building the Education Revolution program. The Committee identified issues with risk management, data integrity and reporting processes and the effect these issues have had on implementation and delivery.</para>
<para class="block">Overall the Committee made four recommendations which, if implemented, will ensure ongoing improvement in public administration of government funds.</para>
<para class="block">Turning to Report 419, this report examines the Auditor-General Act 1997, which sets out the functions and powers of the Commonwealth Auditor-General. The Committee conducted this inquiry to assess whether the powers of the Auditor-General and the Australian National Audit Office remain adequate in the modern public sector environment. It has been nine years since the last such review by the Committee.</para>
<para class="block">The Committee acknowledged the gap in accountability of Commonwealth grants to states and territories. In his evidence to the Committee the Auditor-General indicated the difficulties his office experiences in ‘following the dollar’ with regard to Commonwealth funding for programs and projects administered by the states and territories. He told the Committee that this had been demonstrated with regard to a number of recent programs including the BER. More recently this could prove relevant to the implementation of flood reconstruction programs in Queensland. To improve accountability and transparency therefore, the Committee supports changes to the Act to enable the Auditor-General to access information and records relating to the use of Commonwealth funds and to audit that information under certain circumstances.</para>
<para class="block">The Committee also recognises the increasing use of contractors to implement government programs and services. While acknowledging the benefits of this practice, the Committee is concerned about the potential undermining of Ministerial responsibility and Parliamentary oversight. The Committee wants to see more accountability in this area and accordingly wants the Auditor-General to have the power to audit contractors delivering government programs and services.</para>
<para class="block">The Committee considers that the Auditor-General should have the statutory authority to address these issues. Accordingly, the Committee has made 13 recommendations which, if enacted, will enhance the power of the Auditor-General, including:</para>
</quote>
<quote>
<list type="bullet">
<item>
<para>giving the Auditor-General greater authority to ‘follow the dollar’ where non-commonwealth bodies, including contractors and agencies in other levels of government, are in receipt of Commonwealth funding;</para>
</item>
<item>
<para>removing outdated restrictions on the Auditor-General’s capacity to initiate audits of Commonwealth-controlled Government Business Enterprises;</para>
</item>
<item>
<para>ensuring that the Auditor-General’s full information-gathering powers for traditional performance audits also apply to ‘assurance’ reviews the parliament might wish him to carry out; and</para>
</item>
<item>
<para>enhancing the Auditor-General’s role in reviewing the adequacy of agencies’ performance information.</para>
</item>
</list>
</quote>
<quote>
<para class="block">The changes proposed by the Committee will help ensure that Commonwealth funding is fully accounted for and that the taxpayer is receiving value for money.</para>
<para class="block">I would like to take this opportunity to thank the previous Committee, chaired by Sharon Grierson MP, for its work on these inquiries. The incoming Committee recognises the important role of the Auditor-General and his office in holding the executive and its agencies to account and looks forward to continuing to work with the Auditor-General to strengthen accountability and transparency and public administration across the Australian government.</para>

</talker>
<para>—First off, I note the distinction between the Close the Gap community campaign, which marks its fifth anniversary next month, and the government program Closing the Gap, which has been extended to cover the Northern Territory emergency response. This is very important, because we actually have two campaigns. We have the Close the Gap community work and the work that the government is doing.</para>
</talk.start>
</continue>
<para>The original Close the Gap statement of intent, which was signed by the government, the opposition and the Greens in March 2008, signalled a commitment to a list of very important measures. Two of these commitments have not yet been met and seem to have been missing from the programs and funding of the government’s Closing the Gap measures. In fact, this year’s <inline font-style="italic">Shadow report</inline> draws particular attention to them, as did last year’s report. The first of these two issues is to develop a comprehensive, long-term plan of action that is targeted to need, evidence based and capable of addressing the existing inequities in health services in order to achieve equity of health status and life expectancy between Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people and non-Indigenous Australians by 2030. The second one is to ensure the full participation of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander peoples and their representative bodies in all aspects of addressing their health needs.</para>
<para>It is the issue of participation that I would particularly like to draw to the Senate’s attention today. It is about much more than consultation, especially the narrow way that consultation is often interpreted by the government and public servants. It is about real partnerships in all aspects of health, life and community. The Prime Minister in her statement today spoke of increased investment, changing behaviours and working together with respect. While we welcome, of course, the continued investment in Indigenous health at a time when government is cutting funding in other areas, I am disappointed to see that there seems to date to have been little to indicate a change in behaviour by the government. I believe that this is required if we are really going to begin working together with respect and to make real progress on closing the gap. The Prime Minister spent a lot of time today talking about and focusing on the fact that with opportunity comes responsibility, which continues the dialogue of the previous government on mutual responsibility. I was disappointed to hear that the focus really was only on the need for individuals, families and communities to change their behaviour, and not on how governments—not only the federal government but also state and territory governments—need to change their behaviours to give and take: to take on a little bit more responsibility on their part and to show a little bit more respect for the needs of real partnerships. There needs to be a change in the way they are addressing some of the issues. In other words, responsibility goes both ways.</para>
<para>As today’s <inline font-style="italic">Shadow report</inline> says in the statement of intent:</para>
<quote>
<para class="block">In making these commitments the Australian government demonstrated that it recognised a sound policy foundation was needed if the COAG targets were to be met. It acknowledged that a haphazard, unplanned effort will not deliver health equality within a generation and that Australian governments must work with Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander peoples and their representatives if the targets are to be achieved.</para>
</quote>
<para class="block">In other words, a health partnership between Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander peoples, their representatives and Australian governments was needed. The report goes on to say:</para>
<motion>
<para class="block">That was three years ago. Since then, there have been significant investments in Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander health as well as other positive developments, such as the appointment of a Minister for Indigenous Health. However, there has been no sign of a plan or partnership. In fact, policy is still not being developed with the adequate participation of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander peoples and their representatives.</para>
</motion>
<para class="block">It went on to say:</para>
<quote>
<para class="block">Broken promises litter politics, but there is more at stake here than just the Australian government’s credibility. Without a plan or a partnership, there is a risk that the significant investments made in health since 2008 will be wasted. It should not be forgotten that planning and partnership are efficiency measures too, helping to secure the best bang for the buck in a time of limited resources.</para>
</quote>
<para class="block">But, more importantly, they said:</para>
<quote>
<para class="block">… it is the ongoing, unnecessary and preventable fatal impact on Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander lives and the suffering that will result if the national effort to secure health equality does not proceed on a firm policy footing.</para>
</quote>
<para class="block">I draw the Senate’s attention specifically to the ongoing problems with the funding and administration of Aboriginal health services, funding that is often fragmentary, short term, over-specific and accompanied by unduly onerous and inappropriate reporting requirements. These problems have been documented and pointed out to the government on many occasions, but specifically in 2009 in the <inline font-style="italic">Overburden report</inline> by the Cooperative Research Centre for Aboriginal Health. We have yet to see the planned and comprehensive approach to delivering primary healthcare services to Aboriginal Australians that is needed. We are yet to see the investment in building the capacity of Aboriginal controlled health organisations to deliver and support Aboriginal health workers and managers of the future.</para>
<para>We have yet to see from the government the type of mutual respect that is needed if we are to form real partnerships and if we are to turn rhetoric into reality. The bulk of the funding for the Closing the Gap measures continues to be delivered through mainstream health organisations, which do not reach out to many of the people in greatest need. Not enough is being done to invest in and build the capacity of Aboriginal community controlled health services, despite their strong record of reaching those most in need and delivering good outcomes to Aboriginal Australians.</para>
<para>Having said that, although it was not addressed in the Prime Minister’s speech I note from the media today that apparently representatives of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander peak health organisations have been meeting with the Prime Minister, the Minister for Health and Ageing, Ms Roxon, and the Minister for Indigenous Health, Mr Snowdon. I understand that there has been a commitment to start to work together in partnership to follow up on the commitment that I have been talking about—in other words, the development of a more comprehensive plan. I read that in the media just today. We believe this is an important development, and I urge the government to take seriously its new commitment to work in partnership with these and other key organisations. We believe the government needs to ensure that the substance of that partnership and the results that it produces are fed through effectively to COAG, to encourage COAG members to also commit to the development of such partnerships so that all levels of government are committed to full participation and partnership in the ongoing campaign to close the gap.</para>
<para>The reason I believe this is important is that we need to change from the government’s rhetoric to reality. In other words, the government’s actions need to match what it says it is doing. The government says it is committed to closing the gap. The government says it is committed to delivering on the commitments that it has signed up to. Yet it continues to undermine the rights of Aboriginal people. It talks about addressing the issues of disadvantage, but it fails to make the link between Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islanders’ rights and disadvantage. This was highlighted just 10 days ago with the UN Human Rights Committee report on its Universal Periodic Review. There were 145 recommendations made. I admit they were not just on Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander issues, but many of them addressed the ongoing issues of disadvantage and the undermining of people’s rights. The report asked for the full—I emphasise the word ‘full’—restoration of the application of the Racial Discrimination Act in the Northern Territory. It commented on issues around native title, income quarantining and the implementation of the Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples. All these issues need to be fundamentally addressed if we are truly going to close the gap for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islanders in the time frame that the government, the opposition and the Greens have committed to.</para>

<para class="block">The Commonwealth State Territory Disability Agreement (CSTDA) provided a national framework for the delivery, funding and development of specialist disability services for people with disability.</para>

<para class="block">Intergovernmental Agreement for Federal Financial Relations</para>
<para class="block">The Council of Australian Governments (COAG) reaffirmed its commitment to cooperative working arrangements through an Intergovernmental Agreement (IGA) which provides an overarching framework for the Commonwealth’s financial relations with the States and Territories. The IGA represents the most significant reform of Australia’s federal financial relations in decades. It is aimed at improving the quality and effectiveness of government services by reducing Commonwealth prescriptions on service delivery by the States, providing them with increased flexibility in the way they deliver services to the Australian people.</para>
<para class="block">In addition, the reform provides a clearer specification of roles and responsibilities of each level of government and an improved focus on accountability for better outcomes and better service delivery. This is accompanied by a major rationalisation of the number of payments to the State and Territory governments through Specific Purpose Payments (SPPs), reducing the number of such payments from over 90 to five.</para>
<para class="block">The new arrangements commenced on 1 January 2009 and superseded all previous agreements, including the CSTDA. All aspects will be actively monitored through COAG. The National Disability Agreement (NDA) and Disability Services SPP are both covered by schedules to the IGA.</para>
<para class="block">National Disability Agreement</para>
<para class="block">The main differences under the new financial framework that impact the new NDA are:</para>

<item>
<para>The NDA is based on agreed outcomes and objectives as determined by all Australian governments and does not specify input controls, which provides greater flexibility for State and Territory governments to implement solutions that will meet the agreed outcomes for people with disability.</para>

<para>The NDA does not specify funding amounts. Funding from the Commonwealth is provided through a separate Disability Services SPP to contribute to the States and Territories efforts to achievement of outcomes under the agreement.</para>

<para>Delivery of funding through the Disability Services SPP is now the responsibility of the Commonwealth Government Treasury.</para>

<para class="block">The Commonwealth Government acknowledges the importance of recognising the complex and interacting needs and specialist services required by all people with disability, including people with dual and multiple diagnoses and people with acquired brain injury.</para>
<para class="block">The National Disability Agreement (NDA) includes Commonwealth, State and Territory government agreement to reform the disability service system and create a system which enhances the social and economic participation for people with disability. This includes the need to identify, plan and respond to the development and support needs for people with disability at an early stage and at key life transition points, to ensure services are person-centred and provide timely access to supports based on assessed needs. Over time this will mean that service delivery will change to meet the needs of a person with disability.</para>
<para class="block">The Commonwealth, State and Territory governments are in the process of developing a National Disability Strategy under the auspices of the Council of Australian Governments. The Strategy will drive future reforms in both mainstream systems and disability services for people with disability including those with complex needs and multiple disadvantages. As part of the National Disability Strategy, the Commonwealth Government has commissioned an Inquiry into a long-term care and support scheme for people with disability in Australia. It will examine a social insurance model on a no-fault basis, reflecting the shared risk of disability across the population, as well as other options that provide incentives to focus on early intervention. While Australia’s social security and universal health care systems provide an entitlement to services based on need, there is currently no equivalent entitlement to disability care and support services. The Commission has been asked to report to the Commonwealth Government by July 2011.</para>

<para class="block">Through the National Disability Agreement, the Commonwealth, State and Territory governments have agreed to concentrate national efforts of reforms in several key priority areas to focus on providing person centred approaches to service delivery and simplifying access to specialist disability services. The reforms will mean: a system comprising single access points; nationally consistent assessment processes and quality assurance systems; and more consistent access to disability aids and equipment. Service providers will be better able to develop, train and employ care workers; and governments will work together to better measure the level of unmet demand for disability services.

It also demonstrates the determination and strength of people with disability, their resourcefulness and innovation. The Commonwealth Government commissioned this report because it wanted to hear what people with disability, their carers and families wanted to see in a National Disability Strategy.

<para class="block">Additional funding was provided under the National Disability Agreement (NDA) to reform the disability service system. The NDA includes Commonwealth, State and Territory government agreement to reform the disability service system and create a system which enhances the social and economic participation for people with disability. This includes the need to identify, plan and respond to the development and support needs for people with disability at an early stage and at key transition life points, to ensure services are person-centred and provide timely access to supports based on assessed needs.

<para class="block">All Australian governments have recognised the importance of mainstream services, including access to transport, in supporting outcomes for people with disability, their families and carers. Through the National Disability Agreement, Commonwealth, State and Territory governments have agreed to undertake further work to ensure that all people have access to mainstream government services within their jurisdiction, including health care services such as Patient Assisted Travel Schemes. The provision of health transport services is a responsibility of State and Territory governments and is provided through programs such as the Patient Assisted Travel Scheme (PATS). PATS assists people living in rural Australia with travel and transport to access specialist medical services provided in city or regional centres.</para>
<para class="block">Australia ratified the UN Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities (the Convention) in 2008. Article 9 of the Convention states in part that ‘States Parties shall take appropriate measures to ensure to persons with disabilities access, on an equal basis with others, to the physical environment, to transportation, to information and communications, including information and communications technologies and systems, and to other facilities and services open or provided to the public, both in urban and in rural areas’.</para>

<para class="block">The National Disability Strategy consultation report, “Shut Out: The Experience of People with Disabilities and their Families in Australia”, was launched and presented to the Commonwealth Government by the Council on 5 August 2009. The Commonwealth Government commissioned the Shut Out report because it wanted to hear what people with disability, their carers and families wanted to see in a National Disability Strategy. The Shut Out report has been instrumental in informing the Strategy, helping governments to identify the barriers and issues facing people with a disability, their families and carers, and guide solutions.</para>

<inline font-weight="bold">Introduction</inline>
</para>
<para class="block">On 29 October 2009, the Senate referred the matter of the Australian Postal Corporation’s (Australia Post) treatment of injured and ill workers to the Senate Environment, Communications and the Arts References Committee (the committee) for inquiry and report by 2 February 2010. The reporting date for the inquiry was subsequently extended, on three occasions, to 17 March 2010, 12 May 2010 and 24 June 2010.</para>
<para class="block">The terms of reference for the inquiry covered the appropriateness and application of Australia Post’s policies relating to the treatment of injured and ill workers, including whether or not suitable relationships existed between Australia Post management, workers and facility nominated doctors (FND).</para>
<para class="block">The committee received 37 submissions including from past and present Australia Post employees, medical experts, advocates in Canada and the United States and a joint submission from Australia Post and the Communications, Electrical and Plumbing Union (CEPU). On 24 June 2010, the committee tabled its report to the President of the Senate. The report contains four recommendations, and one additional recommendation in a minority report from Senator Fielding, for increasing the effectiveness of Australia Post’s injury management system.</para>
<para class="block">On 19 August 2010, Australia Post advised the Government that it had accepted and adopted all the recommendations in the committee’s report, giving them effect through the new Fair Work Agreement (negotiated with the CEPU and the Community and Public Sector Union (CPSU) in July 2010), which commenced operation from 28 October 2010.</para>
<para class="block">
<inline font-weight="bold">About Australia Post</inline>
</para>
<para class="block">Australia Post is a Government Business Enterprise that operates under the legislative and administrative framework of the Australian Postal Corporation Act 1989, the Commonwealth Authorities and Companies Act 1997 and the Governance Arrangements for Commonwealth Government Business Enterprises. It operates on a commercial basis, at arms-length from Government, and has an independent board that is responsible for the day-to-day running of the organisation.</para>
<para class="block">Australia Post is one of Australia’s largest employers with some 35,000 people working in over 1700 facilities across the county. Among other activities, Australia Post collects, processes and distributes letters and parcels, and provides third-party agency services such as bill payment and money orders.</para>
<para class="block">Commonwealth employers, including Australia Post, must provide a safe workplace for employees as well as a compensation and rehabilitation scheme for employees who sustain work-related injury or illness. The Occupational Health and Safety Act 1991 (OHS Act) regulates safety in the workplace and the Safety, Rehabilitation and Compensation Act 1988 (SRC Act) provides the legislative basis for the Commonwealth workers’ compensation scheme.</para>
<para class="block">Australia Post holds a self-insurance licence, granted by the Safety, Rehabilitation and Compensation Commission acting under Part VIII of the SRC Act. Australia Post has recently been granted a new licence which is valid until 30 June 2014.</para>
<para class="block">The Government’s role, as shareholder of Australia Post, focuses on determining the broad strategic policy framework and goals for the Corporation and maintaining oversight of its performance, financial returns and accountability.</para>
<para class="block">
<inline font-weight="bold">Australian Government Response to the Committee’s Recommendations</inline>
</para>
<para class="block">The Australian Government has considered the committee’s report and is pleased to provide the following response. The Senate committee’s recommendations are addressed in order.</para>
<para class="block">
<inline font-weight="bold">Recommendation 1</inline>
</para>
<para class="block">
<inline font-weight="bold">3.51 Noting the in-principle agreement reached for the use of Facility Nominated Doctors, the committee recommends that Australia Post and the unions representing its employees continue to work in good faith to develop the details of the new policy within the context of the new enterprise agreement. The committee urges both parties to ensure that once a lawful and fair agreement has been reached, both sides work to ensure that employees and managers are well-informed of their rights and obligations with respect to injury management processes.</inline>
</para>
<para class="block">The Australian Government notes that Australia Post has accepted and adopted this recommendation.</para>
<para class="block">On 26 July 2010, Australia Post, the CEPU and the CPSU finalised negotiations on the Australia Post Fair Work Agreement (FWA). Australia Post advised that the parties had also agreed in-principle to a new Work Ready Program (WRP) which would deal with matters in relation to injury management.</para>
<para class="block">The framework of the WRP was subsequently finalised and concluded with the approval of the FWA by Fair Work Australia on 21 October 2010. Australia Post advise that key components of the program relevant to this recommendation are:</para>
<list type="bullet">
<item>
<para>the WRP will be reviewed at the Australia Post, CEPU and CPSU National Consultative Meeting on a six monthly basis; and</para>
</item>
<item>
<para>an audit program will be established to ensure ongoing compliance with the WRP.</para>
</item>
</list>
<para class="block">Australia Post also advises that it is continuing to consult with the CEPU and CPSU to finalise supporting policies and documents.</para>
<para class="block">In addition, in early 2011, Australia Post intends to roll-out a training program that will support its managers and employees in understanding and applying the WRP. Australia Post advises that it will undertake an audit process to monitor outcomes and verify compliance with the new system.</para>
<para class="block">
<inline font-weight="bold">Recommendation 2</inline>
</para>
<para class="block">
<inline font-weight="bold">4.23 The committee recommends in the strongest terms that Australia Post consider ceasing the practice of using medical assessments obtained under the Injury Management (Early Intervention) Policy for workers’ compensation purposes.</inline>

<inline font-weight="bold">Australian Government Response</inline>
</para>
<para class="block">The Australian Government notes that Australia Post has accepted and adopted this recommendation.</para>
<para class="block">Australia Post advises that the WRP provides for an employee, after attending a facility nominated doctor, to elect to consult their own doctor. In such instances, any certificate produced by the facility nominated doctor would not be required to be attached to any workers’ compensation claim made by the employee.</para>
<para class="block">Given the requirement under the SRC Act for workers compensation claims to include a medical certificate, Australia Post advises that where an employee elects to consult a facility nominated doctor as their treating doctor, they would need to provide medical evidence from this doctor should they lodge a workers’ compensation claim. Medical reports arising from a fitness for duty examination arranged by Australia Post would not be used in workers’ compensation matters without written consent from the employee.</para>
<para class="block">
<inline font-weight="bold">4.24 The committee further recommends that Australia Post ensure that every time an employee attends a FND, whether voluntarily or compulsorily, the employee is advised of the uses to which the FND’s medical assessment may be put. The committee urges Australia Post to consult with the unions representing Australia Post employees to develop appropriate material to inform employees of the implications of FND visits.</inline>

</para>
<para class="block">The Australian Government notes that Australia Post has accepted and adopted this recommendation.</para>
<para class="block">Australia Post has informed the Government that the wording of the WRP makes it clear that the program is completely voluntary and that FND certificates will not be attached to workers’ compensation claims unless provided by the employee to whom the claim relates. The WRP includes an Employee Benefits and Responsibility section which will be provided to employees who participate in the program.</para>
<para class="block">
<inline font-weight="bold">Recommendation 3</inline>
</para>
<para class="block">
<inline font-weight="bold">5.65 The committee recommends that Australia Post develop processes through which injured workers have buy-in to their return to work program, and which ensure that all injured workers are given appropriate work to undertake on their return. Specifically, the committee advises that in each instance, a manager should discuss with an injured employee what duties they are physically capable of, would find satisfying, and would be happy to perform.</inline>

<para class="block">The Australian Government notes that Australia Post has accepted and adopted this recommendation.</para>
<para class="block">Australia Post advises that the provisions of the WRP include detailed information on the various duties and physical requirements of each of its main employment functions. This is intended to assist doctors to identify the type of work an employee would be able to perform having regard to any restrictions on their capacity to work. The program also requires that employees be provided with safe and meaningful duties.</para>
<para class="block">Australia Post has undertaken to expand the program wording and instruction sheets to specifically require employees to have ‘buy-in’ to their return to work program and that the responsible manager must discuss with the employee the duties they would find satisfying and be capable of performing.</para>
<para class="block">
<inline font-weight="bold">Recommendation 4</inline>
</para>
<para class="block">
<inline font-weight="bold">The committee recommends in the strongest terms that Australia Post consider directing managers that they are not to be present in employee medical consultations unless their presence is specifically requested by the employee.

<para class="block">In addition to the recommendations made by the committee, one further recommendation was made by Senator Steve Fielding concerning financial rewards and the health and wellbeing of employees.</para>

</para>
<para class="block">The Australian Government notes that Australia Post has accepted and adopted this recommendation.</para>
<para class="block">In March 2010 Australia Post, the CEPU and CPSU signed a Memorandum of Understanding (MOU) aimed at creating a more effective working relationship between the parties. Included in the MOU was an agreement that Australia Post would immediately remove the use of Lost Time Injury Frequency Rates (LTIFR) from bonus targets for managers. Australia Post advises that it has implemented this. Australia Post explains that all managers are to receive new performance scorecards upon which bonus payments will be made, depending on key performance indicators being reached. LTIFR will be a gateway performance measure, which means that managers either do or do not get a bonus based on the Corporation’s overall performance against the national target, not an individual or workplace target. Individual performance components of the scorecard provide for individual managers to be assessed against compliance with general OH&amp;S management at the workplace level, rather than managers being held to account and rewarded or penalised based on a workplace LTIFR score, which used to apply under its previous performance management system.</para>
<para class="block">
<inline font-weight="bold">Concluding remark</inline>
</para>
<para class="block">Australia Post’s reported actions are consistent with the advice provided by Australia Post to the Safety, Rehabilitation and Compensation Commission, which recently approved Australia Post’s application for the renewal of its self-insurance licence. In September 2010, the Commission welcomed Australia Post’s positive response to the Senate committee’s recommendations and was encouraged by progress that had already been made.</para>

<para>That the Senate take note of the documents tabled earlier today.</para>
</motion>
<para class="block">I am very disappointed to have to move to take note of the correspondence from the Information Commissioner responding to various orders that have been passed by this Senate. We have asked him to make an assessment and report back to the Senate about the government’s refusal to release information in relation to a number of matters. Mainly the Senate was seeking some detail which the government is refusing to make public in relation to the mining tax and some detail the government is refusing to make public in relation to the proposed GST clawback as part of the broader health package.</para>
<para>Of course, our grief here is with the government. We do have a very secretive government. Contrary to the promises that were made by the Prime Minister after her re-election, this government has actually become more secretive instead of becoming more open and transparent. This government has now made it a practice to refuse to provide information without following the proper processes in our standing orders. For example, if the government want to refuse to provide information, they are required—and they well understand this—to point to a public interest reason as to why release of this information is not in the public interest, and they are required to provide a statement of reasons.</para>
<para>This has been quite a frustration for the Senate under this government for some time. I congratulate the Greens and Independent members Tony Windsor and Rob Oakeshott in the lower house for having tried to come up with a process to resolve this. The proposal was that, where there are disputes between the executive government of the day and the houses of parliament about release of information, the information commissioner would review the circumstances, provide a report and, if necessary, arbitrate on those disputes. We have now been told by the Information Commissioner that he is not able to do any such thing.</para>
<para>I will make some observations, but before I do I will thank the Clerk of the Senate, Ms Rosemary Laing, who has been excellent in providing me with advice on these matters. The first thing to note is that the Information Commissioner appears not to appreciate that the houses of the Commonwealth parliament have powers that exist independently of his individual statute. The reason these powers are not constrained by the individual statute is simple: section 49 of the Constitution confers certain powers on the houses and requires that any modification of them be made by statutory declaration—that is, by legislation. The Australian Information Commissioner Act does not contain any modification of those powers. Therefore, the powers of the Senate in section 49 of the Constitution apply to the Information Commissioner, who seems to be basing his reluctance to comply with the Senate’s orders on the absence of specific legislative authority for him to respond. This is a misconception. I note that there have been some suggestions that legislation should be introduced to deal with these matters. I am personally very concerned about that, because if the parliament were to pass such legislation then it would be a recognition by the parliament that the executive government has more power than it should have and that the parliament has less power than we currently have under the Constitution. So I would like to continue to work very closely with the Greens in this chamber to resolve this, in particular Senator Ludlam, who I know has taken a very close interest in these matters as well.</para>
<para>The reality is that each house of the Commonwealth parliament undoubtedly has the power to order the holders of offices that the parliament has created to produce documents. Furthermore, the formulation or publication of a document pursuant to an order of a house is explicitly defined as a proceeding in parliament under section 16 of the Parliamentary Privileges Act 1987 and therefore absolutely protected by parliamentary privilege. I guess it is possible—who knows?—that the Information Commissioner is somehow worried that the government may take action against him if he were to comply with these orders of the Senate. On the contrary: he is more at risk of action being taken by the Senate for his not complying with the orders.</para>
<para>I think it is important to note that there are only very few cases in which the parliament has chosen to limit its powers with respect to offices that it has created. One such case, of course, concerns the Auditor-General, where there is an explicit limitation. My advice from the Clerk of the Senate is that the Senate Standing Committee of Privileges has conducted a long campaign to improve the standard of knowledge and awareness of parliamentary matters among senior public servants and statutory office holders. I recommend that the privileges committee has another look at this and considers stepping up that campaign yet again.</para>
<para>The other important thing to note is that under previous governments of both persuasions—Labor or coalition, whether it was the Keating government or the Howard government—statutory agencies like the Office of the Australian Information Commissioner or like the Productivity Commission, for that matter, did comply with these sorts of orders. I will seek leave to table a document which the Clerk’s office has very kindly prepared for me. I now seek leave to table a document which was previously circulated in the chamber to various groups.</para>

<para>—I table this document and draw the attention of the Senate to a whole series of precedents in which the Senate has passed orders and statutory agencies have complied with these orders. During the time of the Keating government, back in 1992, then Senator Harradine initiated an order seeking a statement by the Auditor-General on matters relating to Australia Post. It was agreed to by the Senate, the document was tabled and subsequently the motion was removed from the <inline font-style="italic">Notice Paper</inline>. Senator Spindler sought a report in relation to leases in the Casselden Place building in Melbourne. It was agreed to, documents were tabled and the order was removed from the <inline font-style="italic">Notice Paper</inline>. That was in the time of the Keating government.</para>
</talk.start>
</continue>
<para>Going forward into the time of the Howard government, Senator Murray sought a report by the ACCC, a statutory agency, relating to grocery retailers. The motion was agreed to by the Senate, the document was tabled and the order was eventually removed from the <inline font-style="italic">Notice Paper</inline>. Then Democrats Senator Allison sought an ACCC report on tobacco and health related issues—the same thing occurred: the order agreed to, documents were tabled and the order was removed from the <inline font-style="italic">Notice Paper</inline>. Senator Conroy, now the Acting Leader of the Government in the Senate, in opposition back in March 2002 initiated a motion which was passed by the Senate directing certain officers of the Advisory Board of the Australian Office of Financial Management to appear before the Economics Legislation Committee and to provide relevant documentation relating to foreign currency. After the Senate agreed to this order, the documents were provided to the committee as requested. Again, Senator Allison sought documents and information from the ACCC in relation to tobacco companies. The documents were tabled and the order was removed from the <inline font-style="italic">Notice Paper</inline>. Senator Conroy, again, later sought a report by the ACCC relating to a competition notice issued to Telstra to be provided on a confidential basis to a particular committee. The motion was agreed to on those terms, it was complied with and the notice was removed from the <inline font-style="italic">Notice Paper</inline>.</para>
<para>In more recent times there have been some precedents too. Senator Xenophon initiated a reference to the Productivity Commission requiring modelling of alternative emissions trading schemes. It was agreed to by the Senate, some documents were presented out of sitting, some other documents were tabled and there is at present partial compliance. Senator Fielding sought reports by the Australian Securities and Investments Commission and the Future Fund Board of Guardians relating to disposal by the Future Fund of shares in Telstra. The order was complied with and the motion removed from the <inline font-style="italic">Notice Paper</inline>.</para>
<para>There is a whole plethora of examples. I guess what I am concerned about is that since Julia Gillard became Prime Minister we have had a number of examples of statutory agencies like the Office of the Australian Information Commissioner and the Productivity Commission saying that these sorts of referrals have to be initiated by the minister; that somehow the Senate or the House of Representatives does not have the power to seek the information that we have been seeking for a very long time. Governments of both persuasions, Labor or coalition, and statutory agencies under the administration of previous governments have complied with the orders. This government is going down the path of becoming more secretive, not less secretive. A secretive government makes for bad government, and we have seen a lot of that over the past three years.</para>
<para>The job of this parliament, and the Senate in particular, is to hold the government to account. To be able to hold the government to account we have to have access to information and these processes have to be respected by the government. It is time that Julia Gillard, as Prime Minister, listened to her own advice and started to let the sunshine in. It is also important that this Senate enforces its intentions with these orders. We can refuse to pass legislation. If we do not think we have got the information we need, we can refuse to deal with the government’s relevant legislation. <inline font-style="italic">(Time expired)</inline>

<para>—I will probably pick up in more or less the same vein as Senator Cormann. People by now are probably quite well aware of the issue that is at stake here, and that is what we do when the executive and one of the chambers of parliament disagree about whether it is in the public interest that particular material be tabled and put into the public domain. We have processes under freedom of information legislation that apply to journalists or members of the general public who are seeking to get information, but what happens when one of the chambers of the parliament is seeking information and a minister of the Crown decides that it is not appropriate for it to be handed over? At the moment the remedies that the parliament can pursue are actually quite severe. In Victoria, for example, ministers have been prevented from entering the chamber and it has become a bit of a debacle.</para>
</talk.start>
<para>The remedies that the Senate can choose to pursue are equally severe, but I am not aware of any instances in which either house of parliament has, when push has come to shove, used its considerable powers to compel a minister to hand over a document or suffer some kind of sanction. We do have that ability. It is just, to my knowledge, unheard of that such a motion would be passed by the chamber. What eventually happens in practice is that the parliament backs down. We have seen documents—in the case of the NBN, a couple that I have been tracking most closely; Senator Cormann has a number and the Greens have a number of others—that ministers might have quite legitimate reasons to preclude from putting into the public domain, but we have to take their word for it. On no occasion that I am aware of has parliament pushed the issue and said, ‘No, hand those documents over or suffer some kind of sanction.’</para>
<para>This is quite a sensible proposal. Senator Cormann is referring to something that has been operating in the New South Wales parliament for 10 years or so relatively well. It has not been without problems but it has worked. It has not worked very well in Victoria because the executive—and maybe the new Victorian state government will have a different view—has opposed the idea of an independent umpire. When we are deadlocked, when we make an order for production and the minister says, ‘You can’t have it,’ our proposal is that the matter be referred off to the Information Commissioner, a newly established office, to make the call and then both sides of the argument would respect that call. But the parliament will not pursue its remedies if it turns out that, in the view of the Information Commissioner, it is in the public interest that the material not be disclosed either in full or in part.</para>
<para>We think that proposal is entirely sensible. We would be willing to respect the role of the umpire if the system is set up appropriately. I trust now that, on the basis of a negotiation signed between the Australian Greens and the Prime Minister, the government feels the same way. It is ironic that Senator Cormann, who puts these arguments with quite a degree of clarity and obviously great sincerity, comes from a tradition of a government that turned its back on just such an initiative for the previous 13 years. It is not that this is a secretive government; it is that government is secretive. It does not really matter who is in the chair. It does not really matter who is on the ministerial benches. The executive will seek to preclude this information for reasons understood by themselves. I believe it is the job of the rest of the parliament, when we feel it is in the public interest for this material to be produced, to do so. It is not something that has to do with the Labor Party or the Liberal Party or whoever. If we had had Green government for the last century, perhaps we would be running the same argument as was run by the major parties. No, Senator Siewert disagrees with that, but perhaps I am just a little more cynical.</para>

<para>—It is something about the nature of power. It is also something that we can improve. This is a mechanism that the Australian parliament needs. We are in negotiations with the government over this matter, as we are in a number of other matters that relate to the agreement that was signed with the Prime Minister by Senator Brown. I am therefore not in a position to really update the parliament as to how that is going, except to say that negotiations are underway. However, we are hopeful that there will be some kind of sensible outcome that will see the Information Commissioner take up this role.</para>
</talk.start>
</continue>
<para>As for the issue that Senator Cormann raised about whether we would pursue a legislative path or not, I think the senator has raised an extremely important issue. That is, if we go down this track, are we in fact closing a very important argument about whether parliament has this power to request an officer of the Public Service to undertake a certain function? I respectfully disagree with the views of the Information Commissioner. I think this chamber’s clerk has the correct view, based on a longstanding Senate precedent, that a resolution of the Senate actually carries that kind of compulsion that is not an unreasonable request. The Information Commissioner has respectfully disagreed with the view. We think this needs to be solved before too many more orders for production of documents pile up on the Information Commissioner’s desk or lie here gathering dust, as some of those relating to the NBN have for a period of nearly two years. We think this can be brought to a sensible conclusion. I look forward to the concurrence of all parties and I hope that this is something that we can resolve. I seek leave to continue my remarks later.</para>

</para>
<para class="block">
<inline font-weight="bold">PREFACE</inline>
</para>
<para class="block">This document continues the practice of presenting to the Senate twice each year a list of government responses to Senate and joint committee reports as well as responses which remain outstanding.</para>
<para class="block">The practice of presenting this list to the Senate is in accordance with the resolution of the Senate of 14 March 1973 and the undertaking by successive governments to respond to parliamentary committee reports in timely fashion. On 26 May 1978 the Minister for Administrative Services (Senator Withers) informed the Senate that within six months of the tabling of a committee report, the responsible minister would make a statement in the Parliament outlining the action the government proposed to take in relation to the report. The period for responses was reduced from six months to three months in 1983 by the incoming government. The Leader of the Government in the Senate announced this change on 24 August 1983. The method of response continued to be by way of statement. Subsequently, on 16 October 1991 [tabled 5 Nov 1991] the government advised that responses to committee reports would be made by letter to a committee chair, with the letter being tabled in the Senate at the earliest opportunity. The government affirmed this commitment in June 1996 to respond to relevant parliamentary committee reports within three months of presentation. The current government indicated on 26 June and 4 December 2008 that it is committed to providing timely responses to parliamentary committee reports<inline font-variant="superscript" font-size="9.5pt">1</inline>.</para>
<para class="block">Although, on 29 September 2010, the House agreed to a resolution which places a six month response time on House and joint committee reports tabled in the House, the Senate has not agreed to a similar resolution. Therefore, this report is prepared on the basis of a three month reporting requirement for Senate and joint committee reports tabled in the Senate.</para>
<para class="block">This list does not usually include reports of the Parliamentary Standing Committee on Public Works or the following Senate Standing Committees: Appropriations and Staffing, Privileges, Procedure, Publications, Regulations and Ordinances, Scrutiny of Bills, Selection of Bills and Senators’ Interests. However, such reports will be included if they require a response. Government responses to reports of the Public Works Committee are normally reflected in motions in the House of Representatives for the approval of works after the relevant report has been presented and considered.</para>
<para class="block">Reports of the Joint Committee of Public Accounts and Audit (JCPAA) primarily make administrative recommendations but may make policy recommendations. A government response is required in respect of such policy recommendations made by the committee. However, responses to administrative recommendations are made in the form of an executive minute provided to, and subsequently tabled by, the committee. Agencies responding to administrative recommendations are required to provide an executive minute within six months of the tabling of a report. The committee monitors the provision of such responses.</para>
<para class="block">An entry on this list for a report of the JCPAA containing only administrative recommendations is annotated to indicate that the response is to be provided in the form of an executive minute. Consequently, any other government response is not required. However, any reports containing policy recommendations are included in this report as requiring a government response.</para>
<para class="block">Committees report on bills and the provisions of bills. Only those reports in this category that make recommendations which cannot readily be addressed during the consideration of the bill, and therefore require a response, are listed. The list also does not include reports by committees on estimates or scrutiny of annual reports, unless recommendations are made that require a response.</para>

The Presiding Officers are pleased to respond to those recommendations, noting that the response to recommendation 5 relates only to those documents that originate within the Parliament. It is also a matter for Government to respond to, in relation to the documents prepared on their behalf.</para>
<para class="block">
<inline font-weight="bold">Recommendation 1</inline>
</para>
<para class="block">The committee recommends that an electronic PPS be developed and implemented.</para>
<para class="block">
<inline font-weight="bold">Agreed in principle</inline>. The Presiding Officers agree that emergent technology and wide spread acceptance of these developments now are such that there is an expectation that the documents provided to Parliament to inform its deliberations be available on line. Other Parliaments are already making similar papers available on line to foster an open and transparent democratic process. While the majority of government documents presented to the Parliament are available online, they are not accessible from a central repository and long-term access is not assured.</para>
<para class="block">The response to this recommendation will be further informed by the business case (recommendations 2 and 4).</para>
<para class="block">
<inline font-weight="bold">Recommendation 2</inline>
</para>
<para class="block">The committee recommends that the parliamentary departments undertake a business case to examine issues relating to the maintenance of electronic records and long-term archival requirements that would be required in developing an electronic PPS.</para>
<para class="block">
<inline font-weight="bold">Agreed</inline>. The Presiding Officers have asked for a business case to be prepared. The business case is to address this recommendation as well as the issues outlined in recommendation 4. The business case is to be provided to the Presiding Officers by early 2011, to facilitate a timely commencement of the digital repository (see recommendation 6).</para>

<inline font-weight="bold">Recommendation 3</inline>
</para>
<para class="block">The committee recommends that the parliamentary departments develop a digital repository far the PPS based in the Parliament.</para>
<para class="block">
<inline font-weight="bold">Agreed in Principle</inline>. The Presiding Officers note the Government's response to the Joint Committee on Publications' report on the Distribution of the Parliamentary Papers Series (PP No. 114/2006) indicating that the ‘[R]esponsibility for ensuring that documents presented to Parliament are permanently available online rests with ...’<inline font-variant="superscript" font-size="9.5pt">2</inline> the parliamentary Chamber departments. The Presiding Officers are prepared to accept that this is a responsibility of the Parliament. However, author agencies are responsible for providing the documents for tabling and, to allow the development of a cost effective digital repository, author agencies will need to provide electronic copies on a timely basis and in the required formats as recommended by the business case (see recommendation 5).</para>
<para class="block">
<inline font-weight="bold">Recommendation 4</inline>
</para>
<para class="block">The committee recommends that a business case, referred to in recommendation 2, also include:</para>

<para class="block">The costs placed on the parliamentary departments to provide the repository.</para>
<para class="block">
<inline font-weight="bold">Agreed</inline>. See comments under recommendation 2.</para>

<inline font-weight="bold">Recommendation 5</inline>
</para>
<para class="block">The committee recommends that author departments and agencies be required to provide electronic copies of documents at the same time print copies are provided for tabling in the Parliament.</para>
<para class="block">Agreed. The Presiding Officers support this recommendation. Electronic copies of documents which have been ordered to be printed or made a parliamentary paper and which have originated with either chamber department or the Department of Parliamentary Services will be provided for inclusion in the digital PPS.</para>
<para class="block">It is our view that the provision of the electronic documents at the same time the print copies arc provided for tabling will assist in ensuring the documents included in the series are identical to those that are tabled. We have no reservations about the misuse of embargoed documents as access will he dependent on tabling. Such issues are routinely managed by the Table Offices of the Chamber departments.</para>
<para class="block">This is also a matter for the Executive as many of the documents currently included in the PPS originate with executive departments. The Presiding Officers note the current requirements by AGIMO for departments and agencies to verify that the on-line versions of documents tabled in Parliament that are posted on websites, are identical to the documents that have been tabled. The use of this process in the provision of electronic copies of documents for inclusion in the PPS will vouch for the integrity of the electronic and tabled versions. Ultimately, the responsibility for ensuring that both versions are identical can only lie with the author agency.</para>
<para class="block">
<inline font-weight="bold">Recommendation 6</inline>
</para>
<para class="block">The committee recommends that a digital repository for the PPS be in production and accessible to users by early 2011, to coincide with the start of the 2011 PPS.</para>
<para class="block">
<inline font-weight="bold">Agreed in principle</inline>. The Presiding Officers note that the scope of the digital project will be subject to the findings of the business ease. The executive's preparedness to provide the electronic format for inclusion in the PPS will be a very important consideration.</para>

<para class="block">For completeness, it is important that the delegation report be presented to the parliament because the canonisation of Blessed Mary MacKillop was such a historic event. It was a great pleasure to be present. For those who are interested in history, the report of the delegation, as well as a compilation video and booklet of all of the speeches made in the Senate and the House of Representatives on this issue, will be provided to the archives of the Sisters of St Joseph in Sydney. This delegation report will add to the completeness of the history for the Sisters of St Joseph.</para>
<para>The delegation went beyond the issue of Mary MacKillop’s canonisation—the chancery at the Holy See was also opened and we gained a very explicit understanding of the work that the Ambassador to the Holy See, Tim Fischer, is doing in respect of the World Food Program, interfaith dialogue and international peace. I want to make sure everyone here knows about the significant investment of not Australian government funds but Australian funds into the establishment of what is called Domus Australia, which is Australia House in Rome—a house of pilgrimage and a fantastic facility for all Australians travelling to Rome. I am sure that those of you who intend to be in Rome sometime will avail yourselves of what is going to be a spectacular Australian facility there for all of us.</para>

<para class="italic">The speech read as follows—</para>
<quote>
<para class="block">The <inline ref="R4485">Federal Financial Relations Amendment (National Health and Hospitals Network) Bill 2010</inline> will implement the key financial elements of the National Health and Hospitals Network reforms.</para>
<para class="block">These reforms are among the most substantial improvements to Commonwealth-State relations in memory. They are all about getting better value for all Australians from the money we invest in health.</para>
<para class="block">The changes will recast health funding between the Commonwealth and the States, making the system more sustainable in the face of rising health spending.</para>
<para class="block">They will dedicate around one-third of GST revenue to health and hospital services and guarantee growth funding to the States of at least $15.6 billion over the period from 2014-15 to 2019-20.</para>
<para class="block">The changes will deliver value for money by creating a new system that provides funding according to efficient prices - what particular health services should cost, not by writing blank cheques.</para>
<para class="block">In April this year, COAG, with the exception of Western Australia, reached an historic agreement on health reform —the establishment of a National Health and Hospitals Network.</para>
<para class="block">This represents the most significant reform to Australia’s health and hospital system since the introduction of Medicare and one of the largest reforms to service delivery since Federation.</para>
<para class="block">We need to reform the health system so that future generations can continue to enjoy world class, universally accessible and affordable health care.</para>
<para class="block">The truth is that while Australia has one of the best health systems in the world, it is under significant and growing pressures.</para>
<para class="block">Australia’s health and hospital system faces significant growth in demand as our population ages and as a result of emerging technologies.</para>
<para class="block">On the basis of current trends, health and hospital spending would consume all tax revenues collected directly by state governments by 2045-46.</para>
<para class="block">We need reform to end the blame game and cost shifting.</para>
<para class="block">We want to provide national leadership on health and hospitals, but also allow greater control at the local level.</para>
<para class="block">That’s why we are committed to working with State and Territory Governments to deliver the National Health and Hospitals Network.</para>
<para class="block">Our reforms focus on three key objectives.</para>
<para class="block">First, they will reform the governance of our health and hospital system and ensure <inline font-size="14pt">funding sustainability for the future.</inline>
</para>
<para class="block">
<inline font-size="14pt">The Commonwealth will take responsibility for funding the majority of Australia’s health and hospital system.</inline>
</para>
<para class="block">
<inline font-size="14pt">We will implement system wide reform to health services across the country.</inline> <inline font-size="14pt">We will strengthen governance, report on performance transparently and put in place new national standards.</inline>
</para>
<para class="block">Second, these reforms will deliver better access to high quality integrated care that is patient-centric.</para>
<para class="block">We will deliver health care that is designed around the needs of patients, not the needs of the health system.</para>
<para class="block">And we will <inline font-size="14pt">focus on prevention, early intervention and providing care in the community.</inline>
</para>
<para class="block">
<inline font-size="14pt">Patients should only be in hospital if they need to be there for clinical reasons.</inline>
</para>
<para class="block">Third, these reforms will provide better care and better access to services for patients right now, through increased investments in hospitals, better infrastructure, and more doctors and nurses.</para>
<para class="block">The Commonwealth’s $7.3 billion investment will deliver immediate health and hospital service improvements, as well as supporting the new health network.</para>
<para class="block">This Bill deals with the funding elements of the reforms.</para>
<para class="block">Under the National Health and Hospitals Network, the Commonwealth Government will become the majority funder of Australian public hospitals.</para>
<para class="block">The Commonwealth will fund 60 per cent of the efficient price for all public hospital services, and 60 per cent of capital, research and training in our public hospitals.</para>
<para class="block">We will also take full funding and policy responsibility for general practitioner and primary health care services and for aged care services.</para>
<para class="block">To reduce cost shifting and better integrate hospital and community settings, we will, over time, also move to fund 100 per cent of the efficient price of primary health care equivalent outpatient services.</para>
<para class="block">This investment is fully funded over the forward estimates, wholly consistent with our fiscal strategy and does not add to the Budget deficit. Fiscal responsibility is a key component of these reforms.</para>
<para class="block">We will establish an Independent Hospital Pricing Authority to determine how much it will cost to deliver hospital services funded by the Commonwealth efficiently.</para>
<para class="block">Funding paid by the Commonwealth in the future will be based on how much the independent authority says that it should cost.</para>
<para class="block">This will ensure that taxpayers receive the best value from investments in health care and will drive greater efficiency in the delivery of health services.</para>
<para class="block">
<inline font-weight="bold">Funding Arrangements</inline>
</para>
<para class="block">This Bill amends the <inline font-style="italic">Federal Financial Relations Act 2009</inline> to implement these major reforms.</para>
<para class="block">The Bill creates a National Health and Hospitals Network Fund through which payments will be made to the States or joint inter-governmental funding authorities for the States out of:</para>

</item>
<item>
<para>additional top-up funding to be paid by the Commonwealth from 1 July 2014.

</item>
</list>
</quote>
<quote>
<para class="block">Each State’s dedicated GST revenues will be allocated to health and hospital services in that state.</para>
<para class="block">This will be revenue-neutral for both the Commonwealth and the States over the forward estimates.</para>
<para class="block">The amount of GST to be dedicated to health and hospitals services will then be fixed from 2014-15, based on 2013-14 costs indexed for the GST growth rate.</para>
<para class="block">From 2014-15, an additional Commonwealth top-up payment will be provided, reflecting that hospital costs have been growing at close to 10 per cent per annum in recent years and are expected to grow at around 8 per cent per annum over the medium term.</para>
<para class="block">This means that hospitals costs are expected to outpace growth in GST, of around 6 per cent per annum over the medium term, as well as growth in the existing National Healthcare Specific Purpose Payment.</para>
<para class="block">Consistent with the National Health and Hospitals Network Agreement struck between the Commonwealth and the States, the Bill guarantees that Commonwealth top-up funding will be at least $15.6 billion over the period 2014-15 to 2019-20, provided that all States and Territories are participating in the reforms.</para>
<para class="block">States will be no worse off in the short term, and significantly better off over the longer term, under these reforms.</para>
<para class="block">The Bill preserves the existing federal financial relations arrangements for Western Australia until it becomes a signatory to the National Health and Hospitals Network Agreement.</para>
<para class="block">In addition, the Bill introduces a new process to protect Western Australia’s existing healthcare funding.</para>
<para class="block">The process includes requiring the Western Australian Premier to agree to any change to the existing financial arrangements which would result in a substantial financial detriment to Western Australia.</para>
<para class="block">
<inline font-weight="bold">Payment Arrangements</inline>
</para>
<para class="block">The Bill also deals with payments out of the National Health and Hospitals Network Fund.</para>
<para class="block">The National Health and Hospitals Network Fund, along with the other governance arrangements set out in the National Health and Hospitals Network Agreement, will ensure transparency around the services being provided in individual hospitals, the cost of these services, and who is paying.</para>
<para class="block">The price the Commonwealth pays for hospital services will be determined by an Independent Hospital Pricing Authority. This Authority will be independent of all levels of government. One of the first tasks for the Authority will be to advise the Government on appropriate transitional arrangements to new efficient price settings.</para>
<para class="block">Each Local Hospital Network will be funded for the services it provides and the information on the funding provided will be transparent to communities.</para>
<para class="block">All payment flows through the National Health and Hospitals Network Fund will be transparently reported in Commonwealth Budget papers.</para>
<para class="block">
<inline font-weight="bold">Impact on Federal Financial Relations</inline>
</para>
<para class="block">The introduction of the National Health and Hospitals Network represents a significant change to Australia’s federal financial relations.</para>
<para class="block">The Commonwealth is becoming a majority funder of the Australian hospital system and taking full funding and policy responsibility for primary health and aged care.</para>
<para class="block">This will improve three broad elements of Australia’s federal financial relations.</para>
<para class="block">First, the gap between what the States are currently required to pay and their revenue raising capacities, referred to as vertical fiscal imbalance, will be reduced over time. This will help to secure the funding base for health and hospital services into the future.</para>
<para class="block">Second, roles and responsibilities between the Commonwealth and the States have been clarified. This will reduce duplication of activities and improve coordination.</para>
<para class="block">Finally, those States experiencing a more rapidly ageing population should receive a greater benefit from the Commonwealth’s increased funding responsibilities due to higher growth in demand as their population ages—this will reduce horizontal fiscal imbalance over time.</para>
<para class="block">As a result, these reforms will put Australia’s federal financial relations on a more sustainable footing for the future and allow us to better manage health expenditure growth.</para>
<para class="block">These changes will deliver value for money from our spending on important health services.</para>

<para>That the Senate take note of the report.</para>
</motion>
<para class="block">Even though the <inline ref="R4485">bill</inline> has just been introduced by the senator representing the government, I am convinced it will never be debated in this chamber. Over the last week we have seen Prime Minister Julia Gillard laying the groundwork for a massive backdown when it comes to this ill-considered proposal to take one-third of the GST away from the states and territories. We are in the very unusual circumstance where the government senators on this committee are recommending that this legislation be passed when the Prime Minister is actually preparing for the legislation to be canned. All the while Minister Roxon is out there today saying how important it is for the states and territories to hand over a third of their GST, when it is well understood that this was an ill-considered proposal right from the word go. Let us remind ourselves of how this all started.</para>
<para>In the lead-up to the 2007 election, then Leader of the Opposition, Kevin Rudd, promised that he had a plan to fix public hospitals and that he was going to implement that plan in government, and that by the middle of 2009 if he had not made enough progress he was going to take over the running of all our public hospitals. What happened after that? Instead of a plan there was an 18-month inquiry. We thought he had a plan. Of course, after that inquiry reported, we had a review into the review. People will remember then Prime Minister Rudd and Minister Roxon travelling around all the hospitals, and the images of them in surgeon’s uniforms with their glasses on looking like they were very concerned about our hospitals. They were ‘consulting’. But they still did not have a plan. As we got closer and closer to the next election there was a debate about health reform at the National Press Club with the Leader of the Opposition, Tony Abbott. The Prime Minister needed something—he needed to pull a rabbit out of the hat. What did he do? After having argued for cooperative federalism, after having argued for ending the blame game, he came up with the good, old-fashioned answer: pick a fight with the states and make it look like you are doing something. ‘Let’s pick a fight with the states. Let’s say we’re going to take away a third of their GST revenue and try to make it look as if we are proposing genuine health reform.’</para>
<para>Coalition senators are just aghast at how a proposal to take $200 billion worth of GST revenue away from the states over a 10-year period to 2020, in return for handing $15.6 billion back to the states and territories by 2020, could be seen as health reform. Professor John Deeble, the father of Medicare, an advisor to the Hawke and Whitlam governments about Medibank and Medicare, and hardly an apologist for the coalition, pointed out that the $15.6 billion put on the table by the Rudd and Gillard governments towards state and territory health and hospital funding is, from his point of view, not more than what the federal government would have been expected to pay as part of normal growth patterns. Here we have a government that is trying to sell a revenue shift as health reform without putting any additional money on the table and trying to do a deal that offers less to the states than what they would have expected from the federal government in the absence of this deal.</para>
<para>As we went through this inquiry it was extraordinary how many problems and issues became apparent. First of all, the Treasurer, Wayne Swan, sought to press this legislation through the parliament without having unanimous agreement from all states and territories. When the GST was introduced back in 2000, after having been agreed to by the then Prime Minister, the state premiers and the territory chief ministers back in 1999, there was a very important safeguard: you could not make any changes to GST arrangements without unanimous agreement.</para>
<para>Of course, Treasurer Swan knew this because in the incoming government brief from Treasury it was drawn to his attention. He was told that he did not have unanimous agreement, that he may well have to find alternative ways of funding these so-called health reforms and that it would be preferable if he could resolve these issues before reintroducing the legislation. He did not resolve these issues. He reintroduced the legislation and thought he could get away with it.</para>
<para>This is where the job of the Senate is so important. Through this committee we were able to ask a series of questions of Treasury and to the Department of Health and Ageing. The more questions we asked the more concerned we became. I commend the report by coalition senators to the Senate. There are large variations in the share of GST transfers, for example. The government will tell you, ‘We’ve always recognised that there will be some variation.’ ‘Some variation’, all right! The variation goes from a requirement for the Northern Territory to hand over 14 to 16 per cent of its GST, to the requirement for Queensland to hand over 40 to 44 per cent of its GST, to the requirement for the ACT to hand over 50 to 51 per cent of its GST, and all the way over to the requirement for the state of Western Australia—if Western Australia had agreed to it—to hand over 60 to 63 per cent of the remaining share of its GST. How is that fair and equitable?</para>
<para>Do you know the reason for these big variations? After promising to take over the whole public health system and not quite getting there, Kevin Rudd came up with this arbitrary figure: ‘We are going to become the dominant funder. We are going to fund 60 per cent of a whole series of services.’ So he decided that in each state he wanted to bring that benchmark up to 60 per cent. As it happens, some states invest more in their health and hospital services and do a better job than others. Under these reforms, if a state on average invests more of their own money into their health and hospital services, and if the federal government invests on average less in these health and hospital services in that state, that state would have to hand over a larger share of their GST. They would actually get penalised for doing the right thing.</para>
<para>The second reason for these big variations is that those states that are doing less well through the Commonwealth Grants Commission process—the processes of horizontal fiscal equalisation—have to hand over a larger share of their remaining GST. That is just the way it works. How is that fair?</para>
<para>The real concern here is that states, by the look of it, would actually be worse off. We asked a whole series of questions to the government to explain to us where the additional funding between 2014-15 and 2019-20 was going to come from, other than the $15.6 billion, because according to work done by the Parliamentary Library, over the last three healthcare agreements—over a period of 15 years—federal funding on average increased by about 8.9 per cent per annum. If you project that to what federal expenditure would have been for health and hospitals in the period from 2014-15 to 2018-19—just to look at five years—that would have been $103.2 billion, or an increase of $38.8 billion compared to the previous healthcare agreement. The government’s offer is $20 billion less than what would have been the case if past growth trends had continued—that is, it is a cut.</para>
<para>We thought we must have been getting this wrong, that there must have been something we were missing. So we asked the government to lay out for us in detail whether there was anything else on the table they could quantify for us, any other committed and quantifiable increases in federal funding for health and hospitals over that period. The answer during the inquiry was:</para>
<quote>
<para class="block">Not under that period, no.</para>
</quote>
<para class="block">We found that unbelievable. How can it be that a federal government could take $200 billion away from the states over a 10-year period, give $15.6 billion back to the states from 2014-15 onwards, over six years, and actually give them less than what they could have expected if growth trends over the past 15 years had continued? That remains an unresolved issue.</para>
<para>There are many other issues in this bill, which I strongly recommend the Senate have a very close look at. As I have mentioned, I do not think this bill will ever see the light of day because clearly the Prime Minister is cutting her losses. She realises that the then Prime Minister, Kevin Rudd, and the Treasurer, Wayne Swan, who is still the Treasurer, did not do their homework. They did not get the support of the states and territories. Not a single state or territory government has signed up to the GST handover. No state or territory Labor government has signed up to this. Of course the state governments in Western Australia and Victoria have already made it clear that they are not in favour of the GST handover. This is an important issue. We need health reform and not just another grab for cash, which is what this legislation would have been.</para>

<para>—I also rise to take note of this report and to add some comments in relation to the so-called ‘health changes’. I do not call them ‘reforms’ because, quite frankly, what we are starting to see is a debacle which, as Senator Cormann indicated, began before the 2007 election and which is now effectively ending up in the rubbish bin of history. It is important to go back and have a look at this because to some extent the debacle of these health changes, which were so lauded in 2007, has become almost an embodiment of the failures of this government.</para>
</talk.start>
<para>I would like to take the Senate back to 2007. There was Kevin Rudd saying, ‘Yes, we have a grand plan to fix the hospitals.’ But when push came to shove in estimates, the secretary of the department had to concede that there was no plan—there was not even anything on the back of an envelope. So much for Kevin Rudd’s grand hospital plan. The government therefore had to scramble to find something and that is when, as Senator Cormann says, they suddenly decided, ‘We shall set up a commission.’ In the true style of the Rudd era, when all else failed another inquiry was commissioned and they would say, ‘Let’s bring out another committee, another review, another inquiry and that will get the thing off the front page for the time being.’ And that is what we had.</para>
<para>Then Christine Bennett was given terms of reference and she went to work and produced a comprehensive report, which has become known as the Bennett report. But that meant that Kevin Rudd and Nicola Roxon were faced with actually having to make a decision. So they thought: ‘Are we going to make a decision? No, we will now review the review.’ This led to nightly scenes on television with the Prime Minister in his little white coat and Minister Roxon there as virtually a nurses’ aide. There they were, tracking around the countryside for photo opportunities. It was all about photo opportunities and where did those photos end up going? They went on the MyHealth website and the MyHospital website.</para>
<para>We trawled through all that at estimates and it was all revealed when, I remember, there was an article written called ‘Yes Minister meets Alice in Wonderland’. The government was very embarrassed by this article because it told the story of this journalist who was taken on in the Department of Health and Ageing and whose team was given the job, on a Friday afternoon, of organising a major launch for the Monday because his boss had been told just that day that the Prime Minister was going to make a major health announcement. It was most amusing—not amusing to the government—to see how they did business on the smell of an oily rag and on the back of an envelope.</para>
<para>Finally we ended up having the blue books. The blue book came out with one version of this so-called plan. Then it became a green book, but the version in the green book was different from the version in the blue book. After that, COAG was about to happen and the government really had to go out there with something—and so we got the red book. And the red book was very different again. When you go back and look, the provisions in the red book are totally different from what we originally began with. And that is when it began to unravel. We started this grand agreement at COAG in April and—</para>

</motion>
<para class="block">In moving to take note of the <inline font-style="italic">State of the service report 2009-10</inline>, I note that the report says that employee identity perceptions within the public sector are very high. Workers in the public sector are proud of working in the public sector, they are proud to work in the APS, they would recommend their work agency as a good place to work and they would recommend the APS as a good place to work. Over the 2½ years I have been here, I have been really surprised at the talent and diversity and capacity of the public service to act in the national interest. Nothing will be more important in the forthcoming period, when we have to deal with the floods in Queensland, the flooding in northern New South Wales, the fires in Western Australia and the flooding in Victoria, than having the public service operate effectively and efficiently to deliver the restructuring and rebuilding of this country.</para>
<para>That is why I am concerned that we still have the opposition arguing for cuts to the Australian Public Service. The policy that they took to the election was that there should be no replacement of anyone who leaves the Australian Public Service. This would create great problems within the Public Service. At a time of national disaster, a time when the national interest must come first, I call on the opposition to say that they will ensure that the resources in the public sector are supported. They should be supporting the work of public servants.</para>
<para>I do not normally quote the <inline font-style="italic">Australian</inline> but I will quote the <inline font-style="italic">Weekend Australian</inline> of 5 February because it said:</para>
<quote>
<para>In confronting the economic impact of the floods and the cyclone, Ms Gillard is facing the competing aims of funding billions of dollars in reconstruction while boosting the government’s economic credentials by working to return the budget to surplus. So far, she has got the balance right.</para>
</quote>
<para class="block">Rupert Murdoch and the <inline font-style="italic">Australian</inline>—they recognise that what we are doing, in association with the work that the Australian Public Service will have to be involved in, is correct and best thing that can be done.</para>
<para>It really does highlight the narrow-minded, venal approach of the opposition to the flood levy and the lack of support they have for the Australian Public Service when we are about a national issue of such importance—that being to ensure that we can reconstruct this country; that we can rebuild those areas that have been devastated—yet all we have is carping criticism. That carping criticism, I predict, will be vented on public servants at the next round of estimates when the coalition set about trying to vilify the Public Service and the issues that they have taken on board under very extreme circumstances. The Public Service of this country have stood up well in most of areas. There have been areas with problems.</para>
<para>I want to place on record my support for the Public Service, who helped this government manage through the global financial crisis—when the opposition tried to deny there ever was one—and who will help us work our way through the program that will be required to rebuild Queensland, Victoria, northern New South Wales and Western Australia, given the problems we have faced over the summer period.</para>
<para>I think the Public Service have done well. The Public Service were instrumental in providing support to the government so we could deal with the global financial crisis in a timely, temporary and targeted manner that meant hundreds of thousands of jobs were saved and we came out of the global financial crisis better than any other country in the world. That was a combination of this government taking the steps that were required and working with a professional Public Service, a Public Service who should be supported, not attacked by the opposition as they normally are. I seek leave to continue my remarks later.</para>

<motion>
<para>That the Senate take note of the document.</para>
</motion>
<para class="block">I rise to take note of the Pharmaceutical Benefits Pricing Authority annual report 2009-10. I have the report with me—it is the annual report for the year ended 30 June. A section of this report relates to reforms. One of the reforms that the government is not considering relates to preventative health and the fact that Australia is one of the fattest nations on earth. Just today we have received a report commissioned by the National Heart Foundation and the Cancer Council of Australia—and I congratulate both organisations on their leadership. It is called the National Secondary Students Diet and Activity Survey 2009-10. Twelve thousand students were surveyed, and what did the survey come up with? Some shocking figures.</para>
<para>I know perhaps some of the senators on the other side are concerned because there has been a lack of action, a sitting-on-their-hands approach to preventative health and making a difference in that sphere with respect to obesity and chronic disease in particular. What did the survey say? The survey, which was released today, said that only 14 per cent of students were found to have met the recommended daily intake of both vegetables and fruit, while 85 per cent did not engage in enough activity for it to have a health benefit. They were two of the key findings.</para>
<para>Other fascinating findings were that 47 per cent of all students reported having three to four televisions in their home, while 17 per cent had five or more—that is a fair few. Seventy-one per cent spent more than the recommended two hours watching TV or using electronic media for recreation on an average school day and 83 per cent on weekends. Seventy-six per cent did not meet the recommended intake of at least four serves of vegetables a day, and 56 per cent the recommended three serves of fruit. Thirty per cent reported drinking at least four cups of soft drink or sports drink a week, and 43 per cent ate from fast food or takeaway outlets at least once a week. Nineteen per cent of boys were overweight, while 5.4 per cent were obese. For girls, 17.1 per cent were overweight and 5.5 per cent were obese.</para>
<para>What that means, in summary, is that we are about to have on our hands a crisis that is coming our way. It is a time bomb. It is called chronic disease and it is coming Australia’s way big time. What we know is that secondary students have very poor eating and exercise habits. We know that one in four teenagers is either overweight or obese. This is not good enough. This should send alarm bells ringing in the government’s ear. We already know from Access Economics, as was released at one of my Healthy Lifestyle forums, that the cost of obesity in Australia today is estimated at $58 billion each year and we know that in 2007 Labor, prior to its coming into government, announced that obesity would become a national health priority. But I am sad to say that they have been sitting on their hands. I refer in particular to the National Preventative Health Taskforce report, which is getting more and more dust. There are so many recommendations in that report that are very worthy of consideration and merit but the do-nothing approach of this government is awful. We cannot just sit around and wait for this problem to fix itself. It will not. The problem is getting worse, not better.</para>
<para>The Active After-Schools Communities program, an initiative under the Howard government, was announced in 2004 at one of my Healthy Lifestyle forums in Laun-ceston by the then Prime Minister, John Howard, with the then sports minister, Senator Rod Kemp. That has been proved to have been a very popular initiative. We proved it to Senator Mark Arbib and he has agreed to extend it for one year, and that means to the end of this year with no further life in it after that. That is not good enough. It needs to be extended, and a do-nothing approach is not on. We need to remove unhealthy food and fizzy and sugary drinks from our tuckshops and canteens so that healthy food is the only option for the children in our schools. There are so many further initiatives that could be implemented by this government and, indeed, the state and local governments around Australia. This is a time bomb waiting to go off and the crisis is fast approaching, so this report today confirms that one of the reforms that should be considered is action—and fast—on obesity and chronic disease in this country. I seek leave to continue my remarks later.</para>

<para>That the Senate take note of the document.</para>
</motion>
<para class="block">This excellent report of the Australian Agency for International Development reviews development effectiveness in 2009 and is incredibly important. I notice that today in the parliament at 10 am the Independent Review of Aid Effectiveness was undertaking its consideration and deliberations and gaining feedback from senators and members of the House of Representatives. I thank Melissa Parkes and her group, the Parliamentary Friends for UNICEF, and also the Parliamentary Friends of the UN. I was there as a joint convenor of the Parliamentary Friends of the Millennium Development Goals. Julie Owens, my co-convenor, likewise was there with a number of other members of parliament. I acknowledge the contribution this morning of Sandy Hollway, who is leading that review of aid effectiveness, which was announced on 16 November last year by the Minister for Foreign Affairs, Mr Rudd. He supported the review, together with Professor Stephen Howes, former senator Margaret Reid AO, Bill Farmer AO and Chris Tinning, who is running the secretariat. It was a very useful feedback session on the importance of our aid program.</para>
<para>I did not have the opportunity to speak directly to Mr Hollway and his colleagues, but some of the points I wanted to make—and I know others made them around the table—were along the lines that aid effectiveness is absolutely critical. In terms of the four key points, the first is that education and awareness of the program and its effectiveness across the country to the members of the public—to the mums and the dads and the families out there—is critical to the success of our aid program. Frankly, at the moment I think there is a brand problem. People do consider that we are just doling out money. We are not. What we are into is certainly aid, but it is international development. It is the Australian Agency for International Development, so this inquiry is looking at aid effectiveness and aid and international development. There needs to be more of a focus on international development and the development process. Unless we can make that clear to members of the public, I am concerned that the level of confidence in our aid program will not be at the level that we would want it to be. It needs to be at a higher level. So we need confidence in our aid program and that can be built upon with a better education and awareness program.</para>
<para>Secondly, in my view it does not obtain adequate scrutiny by a parliamentary committee within this parliament. There needs to be a parliamentary committee having a careful focus and a look at it. Yes, there is the Joint Parliamentary Committee on Foreign Affairs, Defence and Trade and I acknowledge the wonderful work they do. They work very hard, but obviously across a very broad range of issues. A subcommittee of that committee does have some interest in the aid program, but clearly within the parliament there is not adequate consideration and scrutiny of that program.</para>
<para>Thirdly, I am very supportive of microfinance and the role of government interacting and partnering with business and the NGO sector. They can make a real difference by working and partnering with those wonderful hardworking non-government organisations—in many cases they have volunteers working with them and for them —and with the business community. Opportunity International, for example, do a wonderful job in promoting microbusiness and microfinancing around the world and around the Third World.</para>
<para>The fourth point is that the burden of chronic disease is now starting to impede the ability of the world to achieve the Millennium Development Goals. There is a clear focus on infectious disease at a global level, and that is absolutely right, with TB, malaria and AIDS and the like, but there needs to be far more focus and strength of effort and resources looking at chronic disease. I know there is a UN meeting coming up in September this year to look at exactly that point. I think that is very important, and I hope that the review process takes that into account. I seek leave to continue my remarks later.</para>

<para>That the Senate take note of the report tabled earlier today.</para>
</motion>
<para class="block">I speak to the 114th report of the Joint Standing Committee on Treaties. Senators might be interested to know why I am choosing to speak on this treaty. This is a 30-year agreement that the Australian government is signing with the United States for our uranium exports. Occasionally I am asked why we speak out about uranium exports to China or to Russia or whether material is making its way to Iran but do not always take on the issue of uranium exports to a country like the United States where there is at least formal distinction between the civil and military nuclear arms. The fact also that this does lock us into a 30-year commercial arrangement that cannot be renegotiated is interesting in itself, no matter what commodity is at stake. That period of 30 years is going to take us into very interesting times. The US is our largest uranium customer and one of the reasons for that is that peak uranium in the US occurred some time ago. The United States had extensive uranium mining, caused an extraordinary amount of harm, particularly in the south-west, and worked out many of their deposits, and now they are our largest uranium customer. The agreement that has just gone through the Joint Standing Committee on Treaties which we are discussing tonight locks us into a 30-year treaty arrangement with the United States on these exports.</para>
<para>As I said, this is not China or Russia. The United States has had a formal distinction between civil and military nuclear arms for quite some time. It is obviously a porous border. It is the same technology being used for different ends but there is a regulatory system in the US that holds a distinction between civil and military nuclear weapons industries. Most of us in this chamber, I think, and most citizens of the world believe that nuclear weapons are obscene and should be abolished, but obviously there are much stronger differences of opinion around uranium mining. The ALP is now grappling with this issue. The conservative side of politics made its mind up quite some time ago as did the Greens. This treaty arrangement locks us into commercial uranium sales with the United States.</para>
<para>The debate certainly is changing and I think some members of parliament and senators have an open mind about uranium. I want to draw senators’ attention to a resolution that was passed at the September 2010 Congress of the Nobel Peace Prize winning organisation, International Physicians for the Prevention of Nuclear War, who are on the side, I think, of most world citizens in seeking the abolition of nuclear weapons. They have never before, to my knowledge, taken a strong position on the issue of uranium mining. They are doctors and health practitioners who have dedicated part of their work to prevention rather than cure, prevention of the use of nuclear weapons in civil or military applications. They passed the following motion in September:</para>
<quote>
<para class="block">Uranium ore mining and the production of uranium oxide ... are irresponsible and represent a grave threat to health and to the environment. Both processes involve an elementary violation of human rights and their use leads to an incalculable risk for world peace and an obstacle to nuclear disarmament.</para>
</quote>
<para class="block">That is fairly strong language. I have no doubt that some in this building, at least, will simply disregard the words of these health professionals. I think we disregard them at our peril. Minister Martin Ferguson, some of his colleagues and some folks on the conservative benches and all the others, members of parliament and advocates who are hitching their political fortunes to this most volatile and dangerous of industries, should be warned and should listen to the words of these health professionals.</para>
<para>Even if every kilogram of this material is meticulously tracked and kept out of nuclear weapons—and heaven knows the US has an enormous stockpile of fissile material even though it is not producing much more at the moment—even if every kilogram goes exclusively into civil nuclear energy in the United States, which is obviously one of the first countries to adopt this technology, there are very serious problems with tying ourselves to this industry. If you get a nuclear power station wrong and you have a bad day, you have to evacuate millions of people who can then never return. People assume that Three Mile Island was a near miss and that Chernobyl was just a one-off that occurred in Russia.</para>
<para>In the limited time that I have left I want to mention one near miss much, much more recently in United States in 2002, which is something that I suspect most people probably have not heard of. FirstEnergy, an Ohio electric utility, was allowed to drive the deteriorating Davis-Besse Nuclear Power Station dangerously close to a catastrophic accident. The regulators in the US had been persuaded to delay inspections of a vital safety component beyond a requested deadline shutdown in order to accommodate the industry rather than forcing an early shutdown to get inside the plant and see what was going on. As it happened they eventually shut the reactor down, got inside, and realised that six inches of carbon steel on top of the pressure vessel had been eaten away by boric acid and they had nearly lost that plant.</para>
<para>A nuclear power station is a pressure cooker containing two or three hundred tonnes of fissioning uranium. If you have a bad day at one of those plants people can never go back. This is the industry that we are in. I do not think that whether it be the United States, the enormous rapid build that is being undertaken in China at the moment, or any of the other countries that we trade this material to, people who think that this industry has its benign face and its military face and that they are somehow separate need to pay very, very close attention to the record of this industry, not what it is promising to do but what it has done and what it is doing today. There are no second chances with this unforgiving technology. This is an industry that we should be getting out of rather than getting ourselves further into. I seek leave to continue my remarks later.</para>

</talker>
<para>—Tonight I want speak about a matter of great importance to my own local community of Glebe in Sydney—the closure of the Glebe Post Office. Local residents were aghast when they heard the news very late last year that their post office would be closing on Friday, 4 February 2011.</para>
</talk.start>
<para>There was no community consultation before this announcement, no period of grace for the community to look for other options and no discussion of or calls for tender to transition to a licensed post office. There was just two months notice over the Christmas period and then the doors were shut. The residents of Glebe were told to go to the nearest post office in the Broadway Shopping Centre on Parramatta Road. Let me say, this is disgraceful practice and utterly unacceptable corporate behaviour from Australia Post.</para>
<para>Mr President, I will tell you some history. In 1852, John Clissold was appointed Glebe’s first postmaster when a postal suboffice was opened in Glebe. Early records have been lost and little is known about the first Glebe post office, but it is believed to have been located on ‘the Glebe Road’, now Glebe Point Road.</para>
<para>On 1 November 1857 a letter carrier was appointed to Glebe along with other inner suburban Sydney post offices of Newtown, Camperdown, Redfern and Paddington. Prior to then letters would simply remain at the district post office for collection.</para>
<para>In the 1860s the post office at Glebe moved to a different part of the village and, although we do not know precisely where, the evidence suggests the new location was along Glebe Road. In 1868, when money orders began being issued at post offices, the then Glebe postmaster, John Tucker, who had been postmaster for three years, resigned in high dudgeon, claiming that the new duties would be too great a burden. But, again, it was time for the post office to move. Two proprietors bid for the tender—one, situated on the corner of the then Glebe Road and Harden Street, now Glebe Point Road and St John’s Road; the other, on the corner of Parramatta Road and Glebe Road.</para>
<para>It is a horrible irony that these two locations from the 19th century correspond, firstly, to the modern-day Broadway Shopping Centre, now the site of the nearest post office for Glebe; and, secondly, to the actual street intersection, although not on the same corner, of the site of the post office building for over a century. Needless to say, the location on Glebe Point and St John’s Road won out. It was then and has been for 143 years the most suitable location for postal services for the communities of Glebe and Forest Lodge.</para>
<para>When Mr John Warden was Glebe postmaster in the 1870s the community began to agitate for a telegram service. The Parramatta Street telegraph station, near the Glebe Road junction—again, no doubt, almost the same location as the present day Broadway Shopping Centre—was then and still is today just too far away from the heart of Glebe. Petitions were presented in 1877 for a telegram service at John Warden’s post office in the heart of Glebe.</para>
<para>The colonial authorities offered the Glebe telegraphic service for tender. A location, at 1 Hope Terrace, Glebe Point Road—a stone house, with a slate roof, a 20-foot frontage, a hall and seven rooms—at a cost of £75 rent per annum, was accepted. Although Hope Terrace does not exist today, it was described as being 50 yards from the Harden Street intersection.</para>
<para>A female telegraph operator Miss Minnie Knott was in charge of tapping out the telegraphs. Due to the policy of amalgamation of postal and telegraphic services Miss Knott also became the postmistress. In 1878 there was still much talk about relocating up to Parramatta Road. The University Hotel on Parramatta Road was offered, but the decision-making authorities of the 19th century were much more sensible than the 21st century decision makers. It was considered ‘inconvenient for postal purposes’. That position is still inconvenient for postal services.</para>
<para>In 1882 tenders were called for a new post office on a new site. The post office site at St John’s and Glebe Point Road was selected. By 1883 two sets of plans were under consideration: a building with a tower, costing £4,300, or one without a tower, costing £3,730. Both these options were considered too extravagant and requests for a more modest building were then tendered. Finally, a £2,139 plan was accepted and the building was completed on Christmas Eve, 1885, ready to be officially opened and occupied on 5 January 1886.</para>
<para>Miss Knott, the trusted telegrapher-cum-postmistress opened the doors on 8 January 1886. Business boomed at the new location. Annual revenue increased 517 per cent, from £290 in 1879, to £1,500 in 1890. A departmental report was issued to assess whether Miss Knott needed more assistance at the post office, and it found:</para>
<quote>
<para class="block">One of the assistants was engaged on duty from 8.30 am till 3 pm; and one from 3 pm till 8.15 pm, and that they were kept busy constantly at the telegraph instruments sending and receiving. Miss Knott was occupied in the booking and disposal of telegrams and attending to the counter most of her time … postal work was often left to the messengers, and thus unavoidably neglected.</para>
</quote>
<para class="block">Some things do not change in 120 years, because Miss Knott’s story is similar to the tale told by the 3½ full-time equivalent Australia Post employees who were run off their feet tending the needs of the Glebe community until just last week. I have been in that post office on hundreds of occasions and, on nearly every occasion, I have had to queue in a queue, five or six people deep.</para>
<para>Needless to say, the decision makers in the 1800s showed far more foresight than the decision makers of today. The authorities, in 1890, granted Miss Knott additional staff. The authorities, in 2010, closed down the post office. Tonight I will leave the Glebe Post Office in 1890—a busy, vibrant and essential part of the life of the community of Glebe. But in tomorrow’s adjournment debate I will follow this story into the 21st century. Unfortunately, it will not be a story with a happy ending.</para>

<para>Tonight I want to discuss the issue of water. There is probably no more significant issue for this nation over the coming years and decades than the issue of water. I am a farmer from the central west in New South Wales, so I live, eat and breathe with the people who are affected by this. I travel throughout New South Wales and indeed the rest of the country talking to people about water issues. And it is not just people in regional Australia; this is going to affect people in the cities as well. We have seen over a number of years both sides in government try to work out what we should be doing with a future plan for water. To date, this government’s approach to dealing with the issue of water and water delivery has been lacking. They have demonstrated no ability to comprehend the effect of potential government policy on our irrigators, farmers and broader regional communities. I am not standing here making that up as a political point; I am passing back to the chamber what has been very clearly said to me and many of my coalition colleagues as we have travelled extensively around the Murray Darling Basin.</para>
<para>For some time now, we have seen this government completely mismanage the issue of water. Prior to the current minister responsible, Minister Burke, we had the minister in this chamber, Minister Wong, in charge of water. Way back in 2009, during the estimates process when I was having some discussions with Senator Wong about the water issue, she in no uncertain terms said that farmers just had to get used to doing more with less—meaning water—and that that was the way it was going to be from now. Obviously, Senator Wong did not take Mother Nature into account when we reflect upon the events that we have seen over the last several months. One of the things that the government has been completely unable to grasp is the effect of water policy on the people in our regional communities. What I am talking about here are the social and economic impacts of water policy and, in the instance of this Labor government, the policy of permanently removing water from those communities.</para>
<para>For quite some time now, we on this side have recognised that it is vitally important that those social and economic impacts of permanently removing water from those communities are taken into account. I talked with Senator Wong about this issue back on 28 May 2009 during Senate estimates. Here is what I said:</para>
<quote>
<para>Yes, just on the Basin Plan. With respect to the development of the plan and the consultation process with communities on the social and economic impacts of the decisions that are going to be made in the development of the plan, what is the process for that?</para>
</quote>
<para class="block">For a long time now, those in the coalition have understood the potential impacts in our regional communities. I must note that, on this side of the chamber and on this side of politics, our approach has been to improve infrastructure, to make sure that we utilise water better and to give our regional people—the irrigators and the farmers—the tools to do that. We did not just blindly go down the road of buybacks when the opportunity was there to make sure that we invested in the infrastructure, both on farm and through transmission, and improved those circumstances. It has indeed been very disappointing to see that the government has by and large ignored that process, which over the previous years would have delivered water immediately back into those communities.</para>
<para>What we have seen recently with the advent of the basin plan in October—and this issue has been raised by the irrigators, farmers and businesses in our communities—is that there has not been a balanced approach on the impacts of permanently removing water from those communities through government policy. There has been a real concern that the idea of water being taken from those communities to go to the environment has taken priority over the social and economic impacts of permanently removing that water. This has been heard loud and clear by this side of the parliament and, I have to acknowledge, now by Minister Burke on the other side. But what we saw from the other side prior to that was a complete lack of consultation with those people on the ground in those communities who would have been affected. So it is only very late in the piece that this government has realised that there are concerns out there about the priority that seemed to have been given to the environment when it came to the changes in water policy leading to the permanent removal of water from those communities.</para>
<para>On this side of the chamber, we recognise that if there is a problem you fix it. You do not hide under a rock; you do not do nothing. If you identify a problem—and especially one of this magnitude that has been brought to us by all those people in those regional communities—you fix it. So I am very pleased to say that today my very good colleague Senator Joyce, who has been working tirelessly on this issue and all water issues come to that, has secured an inquiry of the Senate Legal and Constitutional Affairs References Committee into whether there are ambiguities in the act that prevent the environmental, social and economic impacts of removing water from our regional communities from being treated equally. That to me is very sensible. There are concerns with the act as to whether the environment takes priority. This concerns people out in our regional communities—and in other communities as well, I should add; certainly people in our cities are just as concerned about making sure there is a balanced approach and a balanced outcome. Therefore, this committee will inquire into whether there are ambiguities and, if there are, what process we take to fix that.</para>
<para>I note that the former chair of the Murray-Darling Basin Authority, Mike Taylor, constitutional law expert Professor George Williams and Professor Judith Sloan have all agreed that in their interpretation the environment takes primacy. Obviously, there is enough ambiguity there that we need to see whether it needs to be fixed.</para>
<para>What did the government do today? They voted against the motion. We have a minister on the other side, Minister Burke, who is on the one hand saying to people out in regional communities, ‘Yes, I believe that the environmental, social and economic impacts should all be treated the same’, while on the other hand, here in the chamber, the government is refusing to look at the very act that has carriage of providing that equivalence. I do not know why the government—and I am sure many people, particularly in regional areas, will have a real concern here—is not prepared to have a look at the act, when it comes to delivering equality across all of those three areas. The minister said he wants equality. He should be looking at the act and making sure that it does deliver those things.</para>
<para>It has been said that it was this side of the chamber, the coalition, that introduced the Water Act. It certainly was. But on this side of the chamber, as I said before, we know that, if there is a problem, you fix it. So we have no problem with looking at the act to determine if there are ambiguities and what we need to do to fix them. That is streets ahead of what the government are doing, because they simply will not support looking into the act.</para>
<para>Those out there can only ask: why is this the case? Who knows, but at least now we have the inquiry underway so we can look into that, to make sure, because it is vitally important that we get this right for regional communities. We have farmers out there in these communities who have no idea what the future holds for them. We need to give them some certainty. On this side of the chamber we are not going to stand by and watch this government pull water out of those communities permanently, effectively giving them a man-made drought, and not take into account, properly under the legislation, the effect that that is going to have. The coalition are going to make sure that we absolutely get the right outcome for people in regional communities. And it is not just about the farmers and irrigators; it is not just about those regional towns. This is about being able to deliver food security for this country into the future for decades to come. I commend Senator Joyce for what he has done today in instigating the inquiry. The coalition will get a balanced outcome for our farmers, irrigators and all Australian people.</para>

<para>Bill Mansfield spent the majority of his working life in industrial relations and had a distinguished career in the trade union movement. He became active in trade unionism as a young man and in 1963 was appointed Assistant Secretary of the Victorian Branch of the Australian Telecommunications Employees Associa-tion. In 1966 he moved to the federal office of the union, where he held various senior positions. In 1977 he was elected federal secretary of the union, a position he held until 1985. In 1985 Bill was elected Assistant Secretary of the ACTU, a position he held until 2002 when he was appointed as a Commissioner of the Australian Industrial Relations Commission.</para>
<para>Bill represented the union movement on the National Occupational Health and Safety Commission and the Comcare Commission. Bill Mansfield was a forthright, clear and persuasive advocate for working Australians. Bill defended the interests of Australian workers for nearly 40 years. When he was appointed by the Howard government as a member of the Australian Industrial Relations Commission, he gave everyone a fair hearing and his compassion, impartiality and keen intellect made him a very successful member of the tribunal.</para>
<para>Bill’s career as a union official was marked by his commitment to study and learning. Bill believed that workers should have opportunities for training and education. Bill knew that this was essential so that people could advance themselves. He made a significant contribution to vocational education and training, serving as a member of the Australian National Training Authority board. Bill was a key member of this board, which was established to advance opportunities for the vocational education and training of the Australian workforce. It was one of Bill’s passions to ensure that people had the opportunity of education and training that would help them in their working career.</para>
<para>Bill also had a passionate commitment to, and an understanding of, the importance of international trade unionism and institutions like the International Labour Organisation. Bill was an Australian delegate to the ILO and contributed to the development of conventions that continue to help working people internationally. This will be one of his lasting legacies.</para>
<para>Bill also understood the need for occupational health and safety. He served for a significant period as a member of the National Occupational Health and Safety Commission and provided a wealth of knowledge on occupational health and safety matters, and he supplied this knowledge to the ACTU and its affiliates. Bill was held in such high regard by the ACTU that he held the position of ACTU returning officer until his death.</para>
<para>Bill’s high reputation in the business community is epitomised by the statement from the Chief Executive of the Australian Chamber of Commerce and Industry, Peter Anderson:</para>
<quote>
<para>Australia’s business organisations and the employer community more broadly, are deeply saddened at today’s news of the passing of Bill Mansfield.</para>
<para>As one of Australia’s leading labour relations practitioners, Bill was widely respected by ACCI and the business sector both in his senior career in the trade union movement, and subsequently on the Australian Industrial Relations Commission ...</para>
<para>That he was appointed from the ACTU to statutory office in the AIRC by a conservative government is illustrative of his standing.</para>
</quote>
<para class="block">I think Bill was the only trade union official appointed by the Howard government to the AIRC, and I think that speaks volumes for Bill’s credibility. The statement continued:</para>
<quote>
<para>I and other colleagues also served alongside Bill on the National Occupational Health and Safety Commission. Bill was instrumental in working with industry and governments on the 10-year National Occupational Health and Safety Strategy being adopted in 2002, which for the first time included performance targets.</para>
<para>Bill was also a person of international renown, elected to the governing body of the ILO.</para>

<para>Bill Mansfield was appointed to the Australian Industrial Relations Commission by the then coalition government in September 2002 after 39 years as a full-time union official, the last 17 of them as an assistant secretary of the ACTU. Apart from the dedication to improving the conditions of working people, Bill also involved himself in broader issues such as vocational education and training, occupational health and safety and worked extensively with the ILO.</para>
<para>Many people might not know that he left Wangaratta Technical College in year 10 at 15 years of age, subsequently qualified as a communications technician, studied years 11 and 12 at night school and then studied law part-time at the University of Melbourne, graduating in 1972 at the age of 30. Bill was regarded as a very good appointment by all sides. He had a very practical approach to dispute settlement and was a very effective conciliator. He made a great contribution to the collegiate and social life of the commission. He was also known for appearing at odd times with a screwdriver or an electric drill to carry out minor repairs to office furniture. Even after his retirement in February 2007 he maintained a strong interest in the institution and regularly attended social events.</para>
<para>All his colleagues at Fair Work Australia are saddened by his death particularly as it came so soon after his retirement.</para>

<para class="block">Bill Mansfield was a great friend of the legendary Australian trade unionist Laurie Carmichael. Laurie served with Bill as an assistant secretary of the ACTU and regarded him as a fine friend, a great bloke and someone who never did anything nasty to anyone. Laurie advised me yesterday that factionalism, issues of left and right, was never a factor for Bill Mansfield. Bill did what he believed was good and right.</para>
<para>I want to thank Bill’s family for the sacrifices that they have made over the years to allow Bill to make such a magnificent contribution to the Australian trade union movement and Australian society. Bill was a man of great dignity, intellect and competence. He was a man of values. He will be sadly missed by all his friends. His death is a great loss to all who believe in fairness, justice and equity. Vale Bill Mansfield, a union man, a great servant of the Australian trade union movement, a great servant of Australia.</para>

</talker>
<para>—Tonight I want to talk about a topic that is dear to the heart of any Western Australian member of parliament—that is, the Murray-Darling Basin, a topic previously addressed by Senator Nash. At the outset it is fair comment that in recent times there has been a remarkable degree of vitriolic debate about the Murray-Darling Basin. On one hand we have the absolutist environmentalists and on the other we have the absolutist exploiters of water, neither of whom, I hold the view, really understand the issue or the problem.</para>
</talk.start>
<para>These extremes make a lot of smoke and shed little light. Like so many other interests, either vested or narrow and with a poorly informed view, they make life extraordinarily difficult in this area for this government and for previous governments. But in the centre are many who either understand or are confused largely because of the media exploitation of this confected drama. It is difficult to imagine a matter with more complexity than this one, or one which has been so wilfully ignored for so long.</para>
<para>The Murray-Darling water management task represents an awesome challenge. For too long we have taken our scarce water resources for granted. We have extracted water from our rivers and artesian sources as if it were never-ending. State governments and industry too have exploited these sources in the same way for revenue in the first instance and to support investment. As we now know, the state exploitation was such that water was sold that never existed. The buy-back bill was in fact an ambulance pass for the Commonwealth in the national interest.</para>
<para>Yet within this framework, there are many sensitivities which surround water extraction. First, there is a simple need for drinking water for human consumption—of all human settlements in the basin, the largest is Adelaide, which many overlook—not to mention all the other needs for water for those settlements just to continue their current existence. Attached to that are the industrial needs of both primary and secondary production, which sustain those settlements and the broader economy.</para>
<para>Finally, there are environmental interests. These are the subject of just as much misunderstanding as those demanding continuing support for human settlements, their economies and the livelihoods of so many people. The simple fact is that the amount of water available is finite. It is only available if it rains and there is sufficient storage to eke it out. The book burners, whose recent behaviour as seen on television reminds one of French farmers’ antics to protect their unproductive livelihoods, need to come to terms with that concept. So too do environmentalists, who romantically imagine that this river system is perennial, which it has never been. So too do those of the good old National Party, who continue to survive by exploiting the fears of country people for their own particular purpose.</para>
<para>There are a few facts here which Australians need to know and understand as context in this debate, and which are unalterable. The first is that the Murray-Darling system is not perennial. It frequently dries up and it frequently floods. The mighty Murray cod, the riverine red gum forests, the flood plains, the swamps and marshes and the river mouth lakes have all seen both—and have survived, as at present in brilliant fashion. Indeed, as the first explorations of Captain Charles Sturt and others revealed in the 1820s, this river system was bone dry at a time of no human settlement.</para>
<para>Let me quote some evidence of drought and flood written up on the Murrumbidgee River at Wagga, by Mr Ron Pike. It is an excellent article entitled ‘Bunyips in our rivers’ published in the <inline font-style="italic">Daily Advertiser</inline> on 4 December 2010, and says that essentially this detail demonstrates the degree of hysteria and misunderstandings about the dynamics of this important part of the system—all this clearly driven by the ‘we’ll all be rooned’ syndrome attached to the recent drought. It does nevertheless mask a serious problem to be dealt with.</para>
<para>Mr Pike outlines that in 1840 the Murrumbidgee at Wagga was reduced to a chain of waterholes, such that horse races were held in the dry bed. Floods—that is, over 8.2 metres—then occurred in 1844, 1852 and 1853. The 1852 flood resulted in the drowning of 80 people at Gundagai. Then followed 14 years of no floods in which many of the rivers ran dry. There were floods in 1867, 1869, three in 1870 and further floods in 1878, 1879, 1887, and four in 1891. The next flood was in 1892, and there were another five in 1894. Drought returned in 1894 for six long years. Floods resumed in 1900, twice, and again in 1905 and 1906, after which the rivers again ran dry until 1916 when there were two floods. In this period the Burrinjuck and Hume dams were built. There were further floods in 1917, the 1920s and the 1930s. Between 1939 and 1950 there were no floods but the rivers were sustained by releases from the new dams. Flooding resumed in 1950 and continued regularly. There were 22 floods between 1959 and 2010, and between 1993 and 2010 there were no floods. That is where all our recent attention has been focused—on whether it is about drought, global warming, climate change, and all manner of doom and dire predictions.</para>
<para>I thank Mr Pike for his illuminating revelation of fact. It is such a pity that so few would have read his piece, including policy advisers and politicians who might not appreciate his critique of current programs such as the buy-back scheme. It is correct to say that, as a public asset, water can be provided and taken away at will. But there is often an uncomfortable political reality for which we all pay a price sometimes. Poor political decisions often result in compensation—and that is all it is. Except, as I have said, the decisions were made by state governments and the Commonwealth has to clean it up.</para>
<para>Simply put, the question is what is all the brouhaha about? Drought and flood are clearly natural phenomena in this river system. Yet everyone has survived—and in fact I am reminded of another recent revelation. Despite an 80 per cent reduction in water availability in one year, the value of production in the basin area has barely dropped. In the current spate of wonderful rainfall, everyone is agog at the resilience of nature. But, really, the environment is doing what it has always done. The riverine environment has been replenished, notwithstanding the new dam catchments. The South Australian lakes are full. The Murray is pouring out to the ocean. The doomsters and gloomsters have gone quiet. So I think it is fair to say that those people ought to take a Bex and have a good lie down.</para>
<para>That does not mean of course that there is no basis to some of the concerns. As I have already mentioned, the quantity of water available at any one time might be seriously limited. Nor can we deny a whole range of other issues such as salinity and the need for conservation measures such as piping and better irrigation practices. We do need to conserve and protect our water resources from the mindless exploitation of the past. We need to honour the far-sighted thinking of those who planned and built our dams in the national interest. At the same time we need to prevent senseless short-term exploitation to the cost of the entire basin. That is the current task for members of the Murray-Darling Basin Authority—who all have interests to provide for as part of their charter.</para>
<para>Clearly water will always need to be rationed in accord with the priorities established. A constant balance needs to be struck in favour of sustainability. That word ‘sustainability’ actually means something. But it might not be achieved at any cost. Water can only ever be available for as long as it exists. But it is a concept for the long term, not the here and now affecting profits and losses on an annual basis. Clearly, in extended years of drought many agricultural users will lose out—that is a clear business risk. No amount of book burning can change that. Water is not a right—it is an entitlement which can be purchased according to the principles of demand and supply. It is a valuable resource to be managed carefully, not to be used simply because it is there at any one time.</para>
<para>For the environment, though, it is also clear that it can sustain long periods of no water at all—unlike human settlements and industry. As we are seeing, flooding is part of the natural cycle, and storage upstream seems to enhance that in dry years rather than damage it. The only exception to this is the Snowy River and, while it has its own different set of issues, there seems to me to be no rational reason for its exclusion from the whole.</para>
<para>With all this in mind I am happy to say that I think the Commonwealth is on the right track. Clearly there are some interests who have difficulty understanding the issues, but there is no choice. There is a critical national interest at stake here, and the government needs to press on. But in so doing it must explain the context and change the perceptions many have about water. The blunt instrument of price is already having a dramatic effect in our urban areas. Overall people are much more savvy, and hopefully they will not be influenced by the populist and misinformed attitudes expressed by the minority opposed to change. <inline font-style="italic">(Time expired)</inline>

<item label="(3)">
<para>Pre-packaged sales, or pre-packs, are widely used in a number of countries, including the United Kingdom and the United States. They are less prevalent in Australia.</para>
<para>Pre-packs are not a separate kind of insolvency administration. A ‘pre-pack’ refers to an arrangement under which the sale of all or part of a company’s business or assets is negotiated with a purchaser prior to the appointment of an external administrator, who then effects the sale shortly after their appointment. Pre-packs can play an important role in business rescue.</para>
<para>Pre-packs are not without their problems; mainly in relation to the low level of creditor control over the process; the potential for little transparency regarding any deals entered into; and the potential for abuse.</para>
<para>I note that some of these concerns have been highlighted in a recent report by the United Kingdom’s Office for Fair Trading – The Market for Corporate Insolvency Practitioners. In particular, the UK review noted that allegations of assets being sold below market value most commonly arise in pre-pack situations.</para>
<para>I also note that concerns regarding pre-packs resulted in the UK Insolvency Service launching, on the 31st March this year, a consultation process on ‘Improving the transparency of, and confidence in, pre-packaged sales in administration’.</para>
<para>The Government is examining possible reforms to facilitate informal workouts outside of external administration. On 19 January, 2010, the former Minister for Financial Services, Superannuation and Corporate Law, Minister Bowen, released a discussion paper – Insolvent Trading: A Safe Harbour for Reorganisation Attempts Outside of External Administration. Any reforms in this area will affect the use of pre-packs in Australia — as pre-packs are effectively an approach to business rescue that straddles the divide between informal and formal administration.</para>

<para>—The Minister for Defence has provided the following answer to the honourable senator’s question:</para>
</talk.start>
<quote pgwide="yes">
<list type="decimal">
<item label="(1)">
<para>Yes. Planning for the Future Submarine remains based on the Defence White Paper 2009 direction. The White Paper examined a range of military challenges Australia might face over the next generation and sought to design a force structure that responded appropriately to that wide range of possible circumstances. This assessment remains current.</para>
</item>
<item label="(2)">
<para>In 2009 there were three sustainably crewed Collins Class Submarines operating.</para>
<para>In response to the 2008 Submarine Workforce Sustainability Review, the Chief of Navy agreed to implement all the Review’s recommendations and in early 2009 established the Submarine Sustainability Program to execute remediation actions, over a five year, five-phase Submarine Sustainability Strategy.</para>
<para>In the 18 months since the launch of the Submarine Sustainability Program, it has proved to be a highly effective framework for implementing the 29 Review recommendations and realising intended benefits. The Submarine Sustainability Program is primarily concerned with workforce-related reforms that benefit submariners and their families. The Submarine Sustainability Program is well on track to achieve the objective of growing a fourth submarine crew by December 2011. The Submarine Sustainability Program is the foundation for expanding the submarine workforce to meet Future Submarine capability requirements.</para>
</item>
<item label="(3)">
<para>Until such time as the exact level of capability to be acquired, the support concept and the exact acquisition model are determined, it would be premature to speculate on the likely cost. The various studies and related design activities that will be conducted between now and second pass in around 2016 will inform decisions that the Government will make, and will determine the eventual cost of the Future Submarine. The Government will be progressively apprised of cost estimates as information is gathered.</para>
</item>
<item label="(4)">
<para>Similar to the Collins Class submarines and the Air Warfare Destroyer, the Future Submarine will most likely comprise components manufactured in Australia and overseas. The Government intends that the assembly of what will be a vast array of components, will take place in South Australia.</para>
</item>
<item label="(5)">
<para>As with other recent major defence acquisition programs, the Government will consider the Future Submarine program many times before a decision on the preferred solution is taken. These considerations will progressively provide the approvals necessary to advance the project leading up to second pass in around 2016.</para>
</item>
<item label="(6)">
<para>The likely through life cost can not be established until a preferred solution and its associated support concept is identified. Through life cost will be a consideration in selection of the preferred solution. The studies being conducted over the next two to three years will refine the options and associated costs.</para>
</item>
<item label="(7)">
<para>The actual in-service date will depend on the solution acquired. Planning is based on deliveries commencing in the mid-2020s.</para>

<item label="(1)">
<para>At the Senate Budget Estimates hearing on 3 June 2009, it was stated that the estimated overall cost of buying the capabilities outlined in the White Paper will be between $245 and $275 billion dollars out to 2030. Due to the appreciation of the Australian dollar against the US dollar since that time, the estimated cost has reduced by in the order of $30 billion out to 2030. Taking this foreign exchange adjustment into account, the previously advised estimate of the cost is reduced to $215-$245 billion.</para>
</item>
<item label="(2)">
<para>In the 2009-10 budget, the Government provided Defence with additional funding of $146.1 billion to fully fund the White Paper over the 21 years to 2029-30, as a result of changing the funding model for Defence. The 2.2 per cent real growth funding beyond 2017-18 is consistent with the inherent long-term cost of Defence, a point highlighted in the 2008 Defence Budget Audit.</para>

<para class="block" pgwide="yes">(a) Reserve Support The Australian Defence Force (ADF) utilised 1066 Reservists from all three Services in deployed domestic and international operations including emergency assistance and border security tasks during the period 1 July 2009 to 30 June 2010.</para>
<para class="block" pgwide="yes">In general terms, the immediate cost of combat capability is not reduced through the use of Reserves, and their use has been driven predominantly by capacity and concurrency issues. In this latter sense, the utilisation of Reservists to deliver ADF capability does have the direct effect of enhancing the ADF’s combat capability by:</para>

<item>
<para>addressing capacity and concurrency constraints in freeing up the full time force commitment levels in operational theatres such as the Solomon Islands and East Timor, thereby enabling combat capability to be more effectively utilised in other theatres.</para>
</item>
</list>
</quote>
<quote pgwide="yes">
<para class="block" pgwide="yes">Contracted Service Support The decision to employ contracted service support in operational theatres is not based on financial considerations alone, and as such there may not be direct financial savings related to the use of contracted service support. Contracted service support is used in a number of theatres to provide logistic support capacity and supplement ADF capability. This support is critical to ensuring the ADF can sustain the tempo of operations while retaining a degree of operational flexibility. Importantly, the use of contracted support ensures ADF capabilities are used only in those circumstances for which they are best suited. In this sense, contracted support typically frees up both critical personnel and equipment.</para>
<para class="block" pgwide="yes">All of these contracts are support or enabling in nature and are specifically designed to reduce the burden on manpower and expensive assets for the ADF over a lengthy period. The ADF’s ability to provide sustained support is limited without contracted solutions.</para>
<para class="block" pgwide="yes">(b) Reserve Support In relation to the use of reserves on operations, there have been no ‘one off’ savings. Based on the narrow consideration detailed in (a), a Reservist will cost more than a full time soldier for the period of the deployment.</para>
<para class="block" pgwide="yes">Contracted Service Support An assessment of a one-off saving can be made based on the following example of contracted aircraft support to Operation ASTUTE.</para>
<para class="block" pgwide="yes">The ADF operates a fleet of twenty-four C130 aircraft, comprising twelve H and twelve J model aircraft. The C130 fleet is heavily utilised within the ADF, with its air hour allocation apportioned across operations, exercises, training and contingency tasking. It would not be possible to support additional C130 tasking without reducing support to other operations or critical training activities within current resources.</para>
<para class="block" pgwide="yes">A C130 is significantly more expensive to operate than a commercial aircraft. An example comes from the contracted airlift in support of Operation ASTUTE (East Timor). A C130 costs approximately $14,000 - $20,000 per hour (direct cost) to operate, depending on the C130 variant. Seventeen hours flying time is required for a return task to Darwin, which includes positioning of the aircraft from RAAF Richmond to Darwin and return. Total cost is approximately $238,000- $340,000 per movement. A contracted De Havilland Dash 8 aircraft is used for airlift from Darwin to Dili and return. The cost of the contracted aircraft to conduct this task is approximately $29,000 per movement (Darwin to Dili and return). In this circumstance, and while the situation in security in Dili allows, it is more cost effective to contract commercial airlift for this aspect of support for Operation ASTUTE.</para>

<para>The first and major difference between chart C1-1 on page 226 of volume 1 of Australia’s future tax system and figure 2.1 on page 10 of the Resource Super Profits Tax: a fair return to the nation (release document) is that the first chart includes only minerals. The chart in the release document includes both minerals and oil and gas. The second difference is caused by estimates being undertaken at two separate points in time. At each time these were the best estimates available.</para>

<para class="block" pgwide="yes">With reference to the Australian Government Actuary’s confidential submission to the Matthews Review (dated 6 August 2008), the Australian Government Actuary, Mr Michael Burt, states on page 5 that the proceeding cash tables on page 4 are ‘nominal values’ and have not been ‘discounted to give a 2009 value’ and that the department (as the Matthews Review sponsor) has replicated these figures in its own submission. Given that the total discount value in 2009 dollars would presumably be less than the total sum of the nominal values cited, can an explanation be provided as to why the unfunded liability figures contained in the ‘Unfunded Liability’ table on page 3 are significantly greater than the total sum of nominal values given (i.e. the total sum of nominal values for ‘MTAWE Only’ is $7.83 billion and for the ‘Greater of MTAWE &amp; CPI’ is $11.48 billion as opposed to the total unfunded liability figures on page 3 of $10.3 billion and $15 billion respectively).</para>

<para>—The Acting Minister for Justice has provided the following answer to the honourable senator’s question:</para>
</talk.start>
<quote pgwide="yes">
<list type="decimal">
<item label="(1)">
<para>Under the Extradition Act 1988 (Cth), Australia can only consider extradition requests from a country that is declared by the regulations to be an ‘extradition country’. The Extradition Act adopts the ‘no evidence’ standard as the applicable evidentiary standard for extradition requests. The ‘no evidence’ standard applies to any extradition request from an ‘extradition country’ with which Australia does not have an extradition agreement, unless a modified standard applies to the country by virtue of applicable regulations.</para>
<para>The ‘no evidence’ standard does not mean ‘no information’. Rather it means the information required for extradition does not need to include actual evidence of the alleged offence (for example, sworn affidavits). To satisfy the ‘no evidence’ standard the requesting country must provide certain information, including a comprehensive description of the conduct constituting each alleged offence for which extradition is sought. This information must be sufficient to allow appropriate consideration whether, if the alleged conduct had taken place in Australia at the time the extradition request was received, it would constitute an offence under Australian law (the ‘dual criminality’ requirement).</para>
</item>
<item label="(2)">
<para>See response to (1) above.</para>
</item>
<item label="(3)">
<para>There are a range of matters that a magistrate and the Minister must consider in an extradition matter before a person can be surrendered to a foreign country. In determining eligibility for surrender, the magistrate is required to consider whether dual criminality can be established and whether there are substantial grounds for believing there is an ‘extradition objection’ under the Extradition Act. In making a final determination whether a person should be surrendered under the Extradition Act, the Minister is required to consider whether there is an extradition objection, as well as other factors such as whether the person would be subjected to torture on surrender and whether, in the case of offences which carry the death penalty, an appropriate undertaking has been given by the requesting country.</para>
<para>There is no general requirement under Australian extradition legislation that a requesting country be a party to the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights (ICCPR). However, under the Extradition Act, a person cannot be surrendered to the requesting country if:</para>

<para>The Department of Climate Change and Energy Efficiency (the Department) has examined the source documents provided for each of the projects referenced in the question and noted the points below in relation to emissions estimates for each project.</para>
<para>The Government does not support the unqualified use of these referenced emissions outcomes as a basis for estimating future emissions in Australia. Each of these projects are at different stages of scoping and development. It would be misleading to simply aggregate these emission estimates as a representation of medium-term emissions from the liquefied natural gas (LNG) sector. To do this would ignore the fact that many projects could be subject to delays or may not be fully developed, which largely depends on the global supply and demand outlook for energy.

<para>The aggregate of the emissions estimates referenced in part (1) is 58.85 mtpa CO2-e, assuming these projects are fully developed as stated in the question. This quantum of emissions is equivalent to 11 per cent of national greenhouse gas emissions levels in 2009-10, excluding emissions from the Land Use, Land Use Change and Forestry activities under article 3.3 of the Kyoto Protocol, for which data is not yet available (Source: Quarterly Update of Australia’s National Greenhouse Gas Inventory June Quarter 2010).</para>
<para>As stated in the response to part (1), the Government does not support the unqualified use of these referenced emissions outcomes as a basis for estimating future emissions in Australia. Each of these projects are at different stages of scoping and development. It would be misleading to simply aggregate these emission estimates as a representation of medium-term emissions from the LNG sector.

<para>The source document referenced reports that the indicative emissions scenarios for the Browse precinct development represent between 2.0 and 6.5 per cent of Australia’s domestic emissions. As highlighted in the responses to parts (1) and (2), and without prejudice to this project, the Government does not support the unqualified use of these referenced emissions outcomes as a basis for estimating future emissions in Australia. Such an approach ignores the fact that many projects are often the subject of delays or may not be fully developed.</para>

<para>The Government believes putting a price on carbon is the most effective way of tackling climate change. The options for developing a carbon price mechanism, including issues such as coverage, are the subject of consideration by the Multi-Party Climate Change Committee (MPCCC). The Australian Greens are represented on the MPCCC.</para>

<para>The Government has not mandated the capture and storage of CO2 emissions from every future LNG project developed in Australia, or Australian waters. The implementation of a carbon price in Australia will be the most efficient and effective way to reach our emission reduction goals.</para>

<para>The Government’s decisions in relation to the Gorgon Project were whole of government decisions. Those decisions result from the unique circumstances surrounding that project and do not establish any precedents for the treatment of future projects.</para>
<para>Future projects falling entirely within Commonwealth jurisdiction would be governed by the Offshore Petroleum and Greenhouse Gas Storage Act 2006 (the Act), and decisions would be made by the Minister responsible for administration of the Act.</para>
