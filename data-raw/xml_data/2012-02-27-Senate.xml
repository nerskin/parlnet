                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">In the first question, you were seeking information about where radioactive waste was currently being stored, because of the government's argument that there are a number of depositories currently being used. The answer is that it is estimated that there are over 100 locations around Australia that store low- and intermediate-level radioactive waste. They include government stores, industrial facilities, universities and research establishments. Of course, every significant hospital and university in Australia has some radioactive waste in storage.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I gather that the best point of reference for this is Australia's fourth national report to the Joint Convention on the Safety of Spent Fuel Management and on the Safety of Radioactive Waste Management. As you know, states are currently responsible for managing their own inventories, and whether or not they choose to close sites when the national waste facility is established will be a decision for them. As you know, some have already established centralised waste management, like in Western Australia at the Mount Walton waste disposal facility. We think it is likely that many of those inventories will be relocated but, as I said, decisions about that will be up to those responsible for the facilities. I think that is the main question you were seeking an answer to. You also asked a question about alternative sites. The answer is that the Commonwealth Radioactive Waste Management Act 2005 currently allows the Chief Minister of the Northern Territory or a land council to volunteer sites. The nomination of the site at Muckaty Station is the only nomination that has been made under the act; no other nominations have been submitted to the department. None of the informal approaches have been pursued by the government. Once this bill is passed—if it is passed—the minister will only consider sites volunteered by landowners under the protections and legal framework afforded by the legislation. I think that covers the key questions you asked of us. Many of Senator Rhiannon's questions go to some of those issues to do with historical reports. I will also make sure that that is delivered to her office if she is going to join us later.</span>

                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Western Australia</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">12:08</span>):   I thank the minister. I will set aside your answer to the question about whether any other sites are under consideration as I think that has been addressed by some of your advisers at various estimates committee hearings as well. Your answer is consistent with what they have been telling us, which is that it appears that the process is on hold until such time as the issue of the Muckaty nomination has been resolved. Today of all days—when the entire country, from the most senior levels of government down, is consumed with other matters—I think it is cynical in the extreme to seek to pass a bill as contentious and controversial as this one. It is obviously a day when the press gallery have other issues in mind.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The first question that I put to you, minister, was around the number of sites that would close. I put that question to you for a reason. In some of your opening remarks, and certainly in the minister's remarks and in the debate in the other place, we frequently hear that there are hundreds of locations around the country at which materials are being stored. The implication is that they are being stored unsafely and that that is the reason we need a centralised remote radioactive waste dump. The question that I put to you is fairly simple: if we are doing that in aid of closing these sites, which number over 100—that is the response you have given—then how many of them will close?</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The department, despite having a fortnight to provide us with an answer to that question, has not been able to give us a number at all. The minister you are representing in this place has handballed it back to the states and said, 'We don't know.' I put it to you, minister, that it is inappropriate to be using that line of argument if, when pressed on how many sites will close, you are unable to tell us. My suspicion is that none of the sites will close because there is no proposal to reduce the production of this material in any sense. There is no proposal, as far as I can tell, as a result of opening up a dump at Muckaty or anywhere else, to close any of the sites. So I think it is disingenuous in the extreme to run an argument that the dump is needed because of all these sites around the place which are unsafe. I would like the minister to provide us with a list of which sites are unsafe. What are the sites of concern? Where are we storing this material where it is not safe at the moment? Why are we allowing it to be stored at hospitals, university engineering departments or wherever? Why are we allowing that to occur? Why should it take the establishment of a remote waste dump to provide for secure storage of these materials at these sites that are dispersed around the country?</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">In the brief time I have had to consider the minister's response—and I think this might have been mentioned in passing in some of the responses to Senator Rhiannon's questions—I think some of the opposition to a remote waste dump is inconsistent. On the one hand, you say you do not want this material transported to a remote or centralised site; on the other hand, you contradict that by suggesting that waste from dispersed sites all over Australia should be collected on a regular basis and transported to Lucas Heights. I do not think there is any inherent contradiction there. That was in an answer I have just scanned to Senator Rhiannon around the New South Wales parliamentary inquiry in 2004, which was a very good report. You will not find many people who oppose the idea of concentrating and potentially centralising these wastes together in a single place, which will require transport of low-level radioactive waste of various categories. The big argument I have, and which many people have, is about whether it should be at a cattle station outside Tennant Creek or in the active care and maintenance of people who are well qualified to look after it.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The minister will be well aware that the proposal here is to transfer several hundred cubic metres, or in the low thousands of cubic metres, of this material from active care and maintenance at Lucas Heights, where it is surrounded by a security perimeter fence with Federal Police and in-house security and actively monitored and looked after by technicians and people very well qualified to look after it. I think that is appropriate. For as long as we are producing these categories of waste, it is appropriate. We do not think we should be producing this waste, but we will canvass that later in the debate. It is looked after by people who are qualified to do so, people who are trained in the dispersal patterns of this material and who know how it behaves over long periods of time with exposure to water and so on.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">That kind of centralisation and looking after this material at a central site is completely different from loading it onto trucks and taking it to a cattle station where it will be looked after by six of the loneliest security guards on the planet. That is the proposal—two security guards on an eight-hour rotation for the next 300 years! That, I think, is what has got people upset, and at no time has the Commonwealth government made a case for why that is appropriate—for why this material would be somehow safer under the care and maintenance of two security guards than it is under the care and maintenance of the technicians and people who have been looking after it at Lucas Heights for 60 years. That is the essential case that the government has failed to make. I do not think there is anything inconsistent there. That is my very brief reading of the critique of the 2004 New South Wales parliamentary inquiry. I do not think there is any contradiction there at all. At the bottom of the minister's response to my answer on radioactive waste management facilities around Australia, there is a paragraph that reads, 'The government's legislation is based on the principle of volunteerism and does not of itself assume that a site will be remotely located.' My question to the minister goes to this principle of volunteerism. I do not have the quotations here in front of me on the Muckaty nomination but they are quite powerful. They are by the government's proponent, who put the proposal for a remote site to the Northern Land Council. They then forwarded it to the minister for his consideration. The proposal was that they need road upgrades and they are looking for some educational facilities. There has been this process in the NT and across remote Australia of withdrawing support for remote Aboriginal communities, for closing out stations and for concentrating people in particular sites. If I understand their submission correctly, these people are after basic upgrades to infrastructure that has been withdrawn and they are after educational opportunities.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Here is the problem with volunteerism. We can go to some of the most structurally disadvantaged communities in the country, people who are starving for resources and being forced off their land because we are not providing adequate resources, and say, 'Who's interested in a cheque for 12 million bucks?' in a school. That is what our principle of volunteerism amounts to. It takes politically vulnerable and extremely disadvantaged communities and says, 'In exchange for hosting this material that is perfectly safe—which is why we have to remove it from a metropolitan area. It is so safe that it cannot stay in Sydney any longer. We will provide you with basic infrastructure and services that the rest of the Australian population take for granted.'</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Minister, I have a serious problem with what sounds innocently enough like the spirit or the principle of volunteerism, which I am presuming the government is setting in counterpoint to the spirit of coercion, whereby we simply roll into your community and tell you that you are going to get the dump. The principle of volunteerism means, in practice, that disadvantaged communities are being coerced into accepting this material. That is why this is not about Muckaty.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We have heard a huge amount of it about Muckaty because it is named and explicitly targeted in the legislation that we are debating today. But it is not about Muckaty. It is about the principle of why we always assume that it should be a remote Aboriginal community's job to host this toxic material until the end of time. That is the essential problem, here. There is every reason to believe that the Muckaty nomination will fall over. This is either because we will see sense in parliament and reject this bill or the Federal Court will find in favour of the applicants that the land was not properly nominated or that the community campaign that has sparked up around the country continues to do its work and rolls Minister Martin Ferguson right out of parliament in the next election, if not sooner.</span>

Perhaps it will be in western Queensland. Perhaps it will be back in the north of New South Wales. Perhaps, Senator Evans, it will be in your state and mine,—through you, Temporary Chairman Furner—Western Australia, that already hosts a low-level state radioactive waste dump. That is the essential problem I have with this legislation. It has not been justified. The principle of remote storage has not been justified and it has been done to cover some pretty dodgy arguments.</span>

                      <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Senator CHRIS EVANS</span>
                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Western Australia</span>—<span class="HPS-MinisterialTitles">Minister for Tertiary Education, Skills, Science and Research and Leader of the Government in the Senate</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">12:18</span>):  There were a fair number of issues raised by Senator Ludlam in that contribution. The first thing to say is that the accusation of us being cynical in the timing of us bringing on this debate is a bit of a low blow. The senator is well aware that we started this debate in the last parliamentary week and we were not able to complete it. It was always listed to come on today. Unfortunately it started a couple of hours later than I would have liked as the result of us delaying the start of parliament.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I have made it clear to Senator Ludlam—and the Greens, more generally—that the government's priority was to try to get this bill carried; it has been hanging around for a long time. The fact that it came on today at the same time as a leadership ballot inside the Labor Party is just coincidence. We always intended to bring this bill on long before I was aware there was going to be a leadership ballot in the Labor Party today. So that is an unfair accusation.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The assertion that we accept or have argued that the current waste has been stored unsafely is not right. That is not a claim we make. We do make the claim that we will need a proper waste management facility because of the current inventory around the country and the waste that will be returned in a couple of years time from France and the UK. We think there is a case for a proper waste management facility and we are also confident that the current waste is being managed in accordance with the existing safety regulations.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">It is also the case that the inventory is growing. We have the prospects of more being returned to Australia in a proper, dedicated facility and it makes a huge amount of sense. It is also the case that there is a lot of activity at Lucas Heights, as I understand it. I have not been able to get down there since being made minister for science. I understand there is quite a strong building program going on at Lucas Heights and quite a bit of development. All of this supports the proposition that we ought to move to a dedicated facility.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I understand that it is international best practice that waste should be stored in centralised facilities and that best practice is for it be in one location. The more remote locations are regarded as being consistent with best practice. In terms of volunteerism, Senator Ludlam answered his own question. He said that you can do it voluntarily or you can do it compulsorily. The point is, we are trying to do it in a way that provides for people to volunteer a site. One can be critical about that and see it as coercive or one can go for the coercive option, which says that we are just doing it compulsorily. That criticism also is not fair.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Senator Ludlam, you do not like the proposition. I accept that. But some of the criticisms, quite frankly, are not well based and some of the arguments you are seeking to use are not fair. You do not like the central proposition—I accept that—but you cannot argue against volunteerism and also argue against compulsory acquisition. It has to be one or the other. Then you find fault in calling for people to volunteer. That proposition is not consistent.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We think the volunteerism approach is the better approach. It leaves us with more chance of success in getting this proposition up and running, given how long it has taken and how difficult the debate has been about establishing a proper radioactive waste management facility. As I said, there are a range of reasons we think establishing the facility is consistent with best practice for storage of radioactive waste. It allows us to deal with a growing problem. It is not a problem that currently sees us having unsafe practice but it is a growing inventory, with a prospect of more returning. We will have a better waste management regime in Australia by going down this path.</span>

                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">
                    <a href="53369" type="MemberSpeech">
                      <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Senator DI NATALE</span>
                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Victoria</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">12:23</span>):  I have an interest in this bill for several reasons. I was lucky enough to spend several years in Tennant Creek. I mentioned it in my first speech, in fact. I worked there as a doctor in an Aboriginal health service. It is a place that is very dear to my heart.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">If you have ever been to Tennant Creek—some of you may have—it is probably because you have driven up the highway from Alice Springs to Darwin. You might have stopped at Tennant Creek to get some petrol on the way. At first instance it looks like a fairly bleak place. Often the temperatures there are up into the forties. A lot of the shopfronts are boarded up and there are bars on some of the windows. So people can sometimes get the wrong impression—that it is a community that is in decline.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">But once you move beyond that you find a very rich, very complex and deep culture, with a community that has a profound connection to the land on which the people live. We have had some of our fondest experiences in the region. In fact, some of the old women sang a song to me and my wife. They told us that as a result of the song we would get married and have babies. Sure enough, my wife—who happens to be here today, by coincidence—and I have two young kids. I often think back about the song in the back of the Land Cruiser on the way out to get bush tucker. Every now and then when the kids drive me mad I think of what might have happened if that song had not been sung that day!</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Tennant Creek is a place that has its problems. There is no question that, like many areas of Indigenous disadvantage, there are people there who are struggling. I am not going to go into all the causes of Indigenous disadvantage; it is a long and complex story and I know that successive governments have done at least a little to try and address the problems. But if there is any support for this proposal—I have to say the support is quite scant—it comes from a place of desperation. It comes because successive governments have not done enough. We have Indigenous communities who are desperate. They are desperate because they cannot get their toilets or their plumbing fixed. In any other public housing situation anywhere in the country we would expect it to be fixed but if you live in a remote Indigenous community or in one of the town camps and your loo stops working or your taps stop running it can take weeks before someone will come and fix that really important piece of infrastructure that makes a big difference to people's health.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">So there is a question of Indigenous disadvantage and the desperation that comes from that, that may have led some people—very few—in the region to have expressed at least some basic level of support for the proposal. But my understanding is that the level of support for this proposal is next to non-existent. In fact, one of the recommendations from the Senate Legal and Constitutional Affairs Committee was to hear from some of the traditional owners. In fact it said:</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">The committee recommends that as soon as possible the Minister for Resources Energy and Tourism undertake consultations with all parties with an interest in or who would be affected by a decision to select the Muckaty Station site as the location for the national radioactive waste facility.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">My understanding is that the minister has ignored the recommendation from the Senate Legal and Constitutional Affairs Committee. I think that is disrespectful not just to this institution but to the many people of that community who have warmly invited the minister to visit them. I will quote from a letter sent to the minister as far back as 2009, from some of the traditional owners of the area. They said:</span>

I appreciate the fact, Senator, that you have lived and worked in Tennant Creek and I certainly welcome the fact that you do come into this chamber with knowledge of that community and of the Northern Territory. That is a very welcome contribution here.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I want people in this chamber to understand clearly that we have two things happening. The National Radioactive Waste Management Bill before us is a vast improvement on the legislation that was put through this parliament under the coalition government. That is because it will take off the list the three defence sites that had been previously nominated. I urge, and have urged, this parliament to consider this legislation. One of those sites in Katherine borders Barry Utley's pastoral property—his wife Val unfortunately passed away during the 2007 election campaign—and he needs that list amended. He needs to be assured that this site will not be built anywhere near the defence site at Fishers Ridge in Katherine. We must give this man some ability to move on with his life. That defence site was posted on a list somewhere years ago. I am urging the Senate to start looking at that.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">In the legislation there is the capacity for the minister to do just what you want, Senator Di Natale—that is, to consult with the communities concerned. This legislation will enable the minister, the department and ANSTO to get out into the community to start talking and educating people about what this facility is about. They need this legislation in order give them the ability to speak authoritatively. Plenty of people have spoken to people in that community about what the waste dump or the facility means—whatever we want to call it these days—but we need this legislation to provide the officials from ANSTO and ARPANSA with some authority to go into those communities to talk about what exactly is going to be stored and how it is going to be stored.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Alongside this, we have a group of Indigenous people in the Northern Territory who, through the Northern Land Council, have volunteered to have this facility built on their land. Am I happy about that? As a Territorian, probably not. This facility must be built somewhere and we have had Indigenous people put their hands up to say, 'Well, we'll host it on our land.' Senator Di Natale is trying to say that this chamber should decide whether or not that was the right decision. It is not for this chamber to do that. I understand that the position of the Greens is probably that they do not want this facility built anywhere in this country and they would like to delay this legislation as long as possible. But this chamber has to respect the fact that we do have Indigenous people who have volunteered their land—Senator Di Natale talked about Milwayi, the Karakara people and the people of Tennant Creek—the community of Tennant Creek is not happy about this—and that this is now being tested in a court of law and the minister has said he will respect the outcomes of that court case. This legislation can still go through this parliament while that court case is proceeding. The outcome of the court case will depend on which section of this legislation is triggered and put into action first.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I think you are suggesting that we do not want to respect the right of Indigenous people to offer their land up. That is exactly what has happened here. Indigenous people volunteer their land all the time—to have railway tracks go through it, to have roads go through it, to have gas pipelines go through it, to have uranium or bauxite or iron ore mines on their land at each and every stage. Sometimes those decisions are not popular, but if it is a decision that those Indigenous people and those traditional owners have made, we have always in this country respected their right to do that. In fact, we have legislation in the Northern Territory—that is, the Northern Territory land rights act—whereby we fund and auspice the four Northern Territory land councils to facilitate that process. If that process is challenged, as it was in the case of the Kenbi land claim, it goes to court. There are winners and there are losers. The Greens have to accept that in this case there may well be an outcome for the Northern Land Council and the people who have volunteered their land in this court case. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">It may well be the outcome that the challenge to their decision and their right to nominate this land is not successful. And then what do we do? Do we then consider legislation? The minister has set up this legislation so that at least three defence sites are taken off the list. There is a process here to determine how the site will be dealt with and managed. You talk about it being in an earthquake zone. I see no evidence of that. In fact, I see it is outside the sphere of tremor activity. Nevertheless, I am not an expert in that and I suspect that neither are you or anyone else in the Greens. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This site, if it proceeds, will be subject, I would imagine, to a very rigorous environmental protection assessment. I do not think for one minute that ANSTO or ARPANSA would agree to regulate a facility if they were not absolutely convinced that it would last for many hundreds of years. I have faith in those scientists and in those organisations.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I think what is happening here today is that people are frustrated that Indigenous people have actually nominated their land and their site, so those people are going to do everything they can to try and delay and frustrate the process. But at the same time we have legislation to move this debate forward. If the court case is not successful, this legislation at least provides this government with a range of other options and with a means of moving forward. It also provides this government and the officials concerned in ARPANSA, ANSTO and the department with legislative protection and the means to get into the community and consult. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I have been in the Territory as you have, and there are all sorts of stories about what may or may not happen as a result of this facility being built. Similarly, I heard all sorts of stories about what might or might not happen when bauxite was mined on the Gove Peninsula. We hear all those kinds of rumours. Sometimes they come to fruition; sometimes there is damage to the environment; and sometimes we have to wait and see and have faith in the processes that are in place. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I understand the frustration about what is happening, but there are two processes running side by side. Our job today is to make sure that we get through this parliament a good legislative base to move forward with where we are going to put the radioactive waste we have generated in this country. The preferred option is at Muckaty. Why is that? It is not because this government went into the Northern Territory and fingered the people at Muckaty. This government said that they would abide by the nomination of that land, which was given through the Northern Land Council many years ago—before we got into government. We have also now said on the public record that the nomination is being challenged and that as a government we will wait until the outcome of the court case. I think that is a very fair and reasonable position to take. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">In the meantime, we need to get this legislation through. There is a person in Katherine who is waiting to deal with his property, and he is hamstrung because it is beside a defence site that has been named as a possible place for this facility. Under this legislation, the list is gone; that is a good thing. We know that under this legislation there is a judicial review of the minister's decision. We know that under this legislation the minister can send a team in to consult with and educate people about what waste would be stored and how it would be stored. I think they are three very good reasons to move the debate in this country forward and to start to deal with this. </span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I understand the question about Mr Martin Ferguson's meeting. I gather that he has met with some traditional owners—with the Northern Land Council. The position is that under this legislation the procedural fairness aspects will allow for all those things which you are interested in and which have been articulated by Senator Crossin. There is a great deal of security to ensure that procedural fairness. As Senator Crossin noted, the minister has made it very clear that he will accept the outcome of the court case before proceeding. I am told that the site is 120 kilometres from Tennant Creek. Is that right, Senator Crossin?</span>

                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Victoria</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">12:42</span>):  I suppose that, in Territory terms, 120 kilometres is 'around the corner'. I appreciate Senator Crossin's comments and I appreciate the fact that she has acknowledged the widespread opposition to this site. My own view is that sometimes a small group of desperate people will do desperate things, but that in and of itself is not a justification to push ahead with this sort of proposal. The fact that one person is concerned about the prospect of a facility being built next to them is certainly not a justification for imposing this on the traditional owners. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I will correct one thing that Senator Crossin said. I do not think anyone mentioned volcanoes. I certainly did not put forward the proposition that the earthquake zone was a reason not to build at that site. That was the view of a traditional owner; it was not my view. I think it is incumbent on the minister to ensure that he is able to assuage the concerns of the traditional owners. It is important that he carry through with the recommendations from the Senate committee and that he talk to the traditional owners who have concerns. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The main thing I want to respond to in Senator Crossin's comments is the notion that this thing has to be built and that that is essentially the crux of the matter. Senator Crossin's words were, 'We have to build this thing.' One of the arguments put forward to ensure that we have this facility built is that somehow we need it because, without it, Australia's nuclear medicine industry is in some trouble. We heard from the minister that 500,000 patients annually benefit from radioisotopes. In the typical divide-and-conquer approach, he says that anybody who opposes it is seeking to deny people diagnoses and treatment. As somebody who spent a number of years working in the health profession, I have to say it is pretty offensive to hear from the minister that by opposing the site of this facility you are in fact denying people access to important diagnostic medicine. Nothing could be further from the truth, and I am not the only health professional to reject this idea. It serves nobody's interests to try to advance the proposition that you either support this facility or you reject the use of radioisotopes in medicine. It is not a simple and straightforward proposition; the truth is much more complex than that, and I am not the only doctor who rejects that simple dichotomy. In fact, it is incredibly misleading to claim that a large-scale nuclear waste repository such as this one is necessary to handle the minuscule amount of nuclear medicine generated in Australia. It is a tiny amount. It makes up a very small proportion of the waste that will be located in this facility. Of the 500,000 nuclear medicine cases performed every year in this country, most of the isotopes that are used degrade very quickly—within a few days. In fact they are degraded by the time they would be taken to the Northern Territory, and the waste is disposed of pretty safely. There are secure sites in hospitals right around the country, and those storage areas are going to continue regardless of whether this facility goes ahead. So this idea that somehow we need this site in order to continue to have a nuclear medicine industry in this country is just misleading. The fact is that ANSTO would continue to store the waste at Lucas Heights, where Australia's nuclear expertise already exists. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This is a position that is shared by a number of other health professionals. The Public Health Association of Australia, for example, shares this view, as does the Medical Association for Prevention of War and a number of eminent specialist members of that association. The AMA, which is hardly a bastion of bleeding-heart activism, has called for an inquiry into how we source our radioisotopes in the future. There are widespread questions around this notion that we need this to enable our nuclear medicines industry to continue.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Internationally, we know the experience is heading down a very different route to the one proposed here. Canada has made a decision recently to shift towards particle accelerator generation, for example, for all major medical radioisotopes. Right around the world this is happening. Belgium, Germany and other countries are all heading down a very different path to the one that we are pursuing.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I would be keen to know whether there has been any work done on quantifying the exact volume and nature of medical waste presently in storage—and of the expected volume in the future—as a justification for this proposed site.</span>

                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Western Australia</span>—<span class="HPS-MinisterialTitles">Minister for Tertiary Education, Skills, Science and Research and Leader of the Government in the Senate</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">12:47</span>):  Again there is a lot in Senator Di Natale's contribution. Much of it goes to his arguments for why he opposes the bill. When I responded earlier I should have suggested that, in terms of protection for sustainable population, he should be careful in case his numbers are further affected. As I understand it, it is the waste from production of nuclear medicines that requires careful management. We have asserted that production of medical isotopes produces radioactive waste which requires suitable long-term management arrangements. We continue to assert that and we consider that the changes we are making are to implement best practice and to allow us to store the increasing amount of waste, including in our considerations the prospect of the waste being returned from France and the UK, which is a Commonwealth responsibility.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">In an answer to an earlier question from Senator Ludlam—the answer was one of the written answers I gave him—I said that we cannot be definitive about which of the current sites will transfer their waste to the new facility. Obviously the Commonwealth will be looking to do that, but the states have responsibilities for their own waste and who takes advantage of it. From where and how much will be decisions for those responsible, but we do think that legacy waste inventories will be relocated.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I know that the Greens are opposed to this bill and are continuing to argue their case. That is fine, but fundamentally we disagree. We think the waste management facility is needed. We do think there are strong arguments for it to be established. The issue has remained unresolved for many years. I know that you argue that it is safer and better to continue to store the waste in a range of more than 100 facilities around Australia. That is your position; I fundamentally disagree. We think that the increasing inventory of waste to be returned from France and the UK builds the case for having a dedicated radioactive waste management facility built in and supervised in accordance with world's best practice. That is a fundamental disagreement we have, and I am not sure I can address that any further in the sense that you have your view about that and we have our view about that, and it seems we are not changing your opinion. I do not know whether the Greens' tactics are to continually delay the bill or not, but I think it would be useful if we moved on to debating the Greens amendments. That would give some structure to the debate. I am happy to answer any questions you have in the best way I can, but fundamentally my answer does not change in terms of our view about the need for that waste management facility.</span>

But first I note that before we rose the last time we were debating this bill, that I put a number of questions to you, Minister, and that you have provided answers to nearly all of them. I put a question to you, which the advisers might be able to help you out with now, around the absolute quantitative volumes of material in different categories. I also put the question to officers at an estimates hearing the week before last and you said, 'I'm not going to let the officer answer that because you have taken it on notice in the chamber.' That does not appear to have come back in the documents you provided this afternoon. Can I get a reading, please, on whether that material will be provided?</span>

                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Victoria</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">12:53</span>):  Whilst I agree in principle with having a central location, my concerns with the bill relate to ARPANSA. I have had many people from Victoria come to me in my office and I have had many calls from across Australia regarding ARPANSA's accountability for and policing of mobile phone towers, EMR and other issues. I would be very keen to hear where the checks and balances are, that the accountability, policing and security of the facility will be handled properly and that we in the parliament can be assured that people's health et cetera will be covered. Some people have expressed to me a concern that when they express their concern to ARPANSA they are somewhat flippant. As I said, as much as I am concerned, in principle I am in support of the bill but want to be sure that the safeguards are in place to protect people. One of the Greens senators mentioned that there are facilities. I do not want to see a situation where we have short-term gain and long-term pain or question marks through the community. If something does go wrong or if there are concerns, I would like to see that they are addressed with the full weight of government behind them.</span>

It is for this parliament to give ARPANSA its function and role in the regulation of these issues. We also seek to have world's best practice in our regulatory framework. I cannot do much more than answer by saying that those statutory obligations are set by us the parliament for ARPANSA to follow. </span>

Opportunities at estimates could be pursued as well. But they have a statutory responsibility to regulate the issues that you raise. I have confidence that they continue to take that responsibility very seriously. But, as I say, if there are issues that the senator has with the way they are operating or how they are dealing with complaints, I am sure we would be happy to take those on board.</span>

Since the Minister for Resources and Energy became the minister, has he at any time visited Tennant Creek to talk these issues through not just with the traditional owners who brought the action in the Federal Court or the larger circle of families around them but also with the Cattlemen's Association, local government or the rest of the residents of the town? Has he been there at all?</span>

I am not sure that the Minister for Resources and Energy has, his advisers tell me. He has met with some of the traditional owners identified by the land council.

I am sure he has been at Tennant Creek at some time in his career, but my advice at the moment is that he has not been in Tennant Creek engaging on this issue as part of this process. As I say, he has given the indication very strongly that once the bill is passed, if it is passed, those appropriate procedures that are contained in the act will be implemented.</span>

                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Western Australia</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">12:59</span>):  I suspect the minister will not need to rise to correct the record, because I believe he is quite correct—he has been advised correctly, despite the first recommendation of the Legal and Constitutional Affairs Committee's report which Senator Crossin, who made a contribution earlier, made, which was to go and talk to the people. It is good to know that he has met with the people in Darwin who agree with him. He has not met with anybody in Tennant Creek and he has never been there, to my knowledge, in his capacity as the minister and has not even had the spine to turn up and tell people what it is that he is proposing that they host. It is not much help to us or those people to say that once this bill is through he will then get up and consult.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">What this bill does—and I will constrain my remarks now because we will go into this in a bit of detail when we are proposing amendments to fix these grievous flaws in the bill—is give him absolute, total, unfettered discretion to decide where the process will unfold. He is going to nail a pin in a map at Muckaty, once he has worked out exactly where on the map it is, and the bill that we are debating today gives him total and unfettered discretion to make that site the location. So much for consultation. People will be consulted—or insulted—once the decision on the location has been made. We will get into this in a bit of detail, but I did want to pull the minister up on his repeated use of the term 'world's best practice'.</span>

                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I want to talk about recent experience in the United States, in particular the US blue ribbon panel. My question is whether or not the government has examined its findings. On 26 January, after working for two years, President Obama's Blue Ribbon Commission on America's Nuclear Future issued its report. Keep in mind that the United States government and Department of Energy are dealing with a vastly larger stockpile of high-level radioactive waste, categories of waste that we do not technically produce here in Australia. It is not just from research reactors, obviously, but from a fleet of nuclear power stations that are in the low hundreds. They have a very keen interest in resolving this issue and they have had the same disastrous experience but on a much larger scale as the Australian government has in attempting to coercively dump this material, in their instance on native American land.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The commission that I am referring to was established by President Obama to create safe and long-term solutions for managing and disposing of the United States' nuclear waste inventory. The panel was tasked with devising a new strategy for managing the growing inventory of nuclear waste and it made recommendations based on consulting with experts, stakeholders and visiting nuclear waste management facilities in the US and overseas. It was co-chaired by former congressman Lee Hamilton and a former national security adviser, Brent Scowcroft. The report noted that President Obama had halted the disastrous Yukka Mountain proposal, which was projected to cost US$90 billion—billion with a 'b'—and had already absorbed $12 billion just in studies and in engineering tests and so on by the time it was finally cancelled by President Obama.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Anybody watching that project would probably have seen that coming for a decade or so, because that project was plagued with problems and scandals from the very beginning. I think we can take that as something of an impasse about nuclear waste management in the United States. To break that impasse, the President proposed the blue ribbon commission. He said at the time that there was an urgent need for a new strategy, and he pointed out that ethical obligations do not burden future generations with a task—in other words, it is not good enough to just kick the can down the road, dump this material off on somebody's land and hope for the best.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The strategy that the commission outlined has three crucial elements. The first is vitally important and it is precisely the fatally flawed scheme that we are debating today and which Minister Martin Ferguson, the Prime Minister—I believe she still is—Julia Gillard and the Howard government cooked up, presumably with many of the same senior bureaucrats who still occupy these positions today. Firstly, the commission recommends a consent based approach to siting future nuclear waste storage and disposal facilities, noting that trying to force such facilities on unwilling states, tribes and communities has not worked. In the instance of the US, it was in Nevada. I will quote from the report briefly:</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">This Subcommittee recommendation flows directly from an examination of the history of waste-management efforts in the United States and other countries. We drew several lessons from the decades-long effort to site a repository at Yucca Mountain in Nevada and from the ultimately successful completion of the Waste Isolation Pilot Plant (WIPP) facility in New Mexico. One lesson is that support for a facility (or at least acceptance)—both in directly affected communities and on the part of the host state—is a critical element of success. A second is that transparency and accountability, along with the flexibility to adapt to new information and to the concerns of key constituencies, are essential to sustain public trust in decision-making processes and institutions. We believe that a good gauge of consent would be the willingness of the host state (and other affected units of government, as appropriate) to enter into legally binding agreements with the facility operator, where these agreements enable states, tribes, or communities to have confidence that they can protect the interests of their citizens.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Small">The approach to repository development laid out under the Nuclear Waste Policy Act Amendments of 1987 was highly prescriptive, subject to inflexible deadlines, and—as actually implemented—widely viewed as being driven too heavily by political considerations—</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Small">have adopted a phased, adaptive, and consent-based approach to facility siting and development. Finland and Sweden, in particular, have each successfully sited a deep geologic repository with the support of the host community.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Neither of those two facilities is currently operating on a large scale. All of this around the world is still operating on a trial scale, but at least what they attempted in those jurisdictions was an adaptive and consent based approach.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Small">The roles, responsibilities, and authorities of local, state, and tribal governments (with respect to facility siting and other aspects of nuclear waste disposal) must be an element of the negotiation between the federal government and the other affected units of government in establishing a disposal facility.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">There is another question for us: we, for obvious reasons, have focused our efforts and energies on supporting the Aboriginal communities in the area who do not really have the resources to make their voices heard—although they have done an exceptional job of doing so—perhaps to the neglect of the local government authority in that area, which is implacably opposed, and, of course, the Territory government, which opposes this as well.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Senator Scullion has joined us this afternoon in the chamber, and he has been involved in this debate for at least as long as I have—probably longer. Senator Scullion, that was your job: to do what they are trying to do in the United States and to make sure that the Territory government and the local government authority has a voice. That has not been done, and so it has turned out to be up to people from Western Australia and all over the rest of the country to stand up and make the obvious point that the Territory government opposes this thing. The Territory Chief Minister, I think, has done a very effective job in advocating for the rights of Territorians where their advocates in here on both sides from the old parties have gone missing in action.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Small">… to engage in meaningful consultation on matters related to nuclear waste storage, transport, and disposal, and to exercise their proper regulatory roles and responsibilities in this context, local, state, and tribal governments need access to sound, independent scientific and technical expertise.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We certainly have not seen anything remotely approaching that here in Australia. Perhaps the minister will stand up in a moment and tell us that, once this bill has been rammed through and the minister has total and unfettered power to put this thing wherever he likes, maybe the consultation will happen then. We recognise that once the minister has nailed a particular spot into the map—we know that at the moment it is Muckaty—a whole heap of processes unfold. I have spent a great deal of time quizzing ARPANSA in budget estimates hearings, and also the department of the environment, on exactly what their processes will look like under EPBC and under the ARPANS Act. So I am not suggesting that all due process has been blown away by this bill in terms of assessment, because that is not the case; this is the beginning of a very long road, not the end of it. But in terms of site location—the key decision about where this thing is going to go, where all this process will unfold, who will be consulted with and so on—that decision is made by the minister, if he chooses, alone in a room by himself, to just stick an X on a map. That is what is completely inappropriate, and that degree of discretion, in my view, is inordinately dangerous. You would not site a shopping centre car park using processes like this, yet we are proposing to site the nation's first high-level and intermediate-level radioactive waste dump using precisely that process. It is a disgrace.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Again, in the UK there is a large inventory of high-level radioactive waste from a nuclear program designed in the 1950s and 1960s with no clue about how to deal with the waste products generated. It sounds familiar because that is exactly what happened here in Australia. Isn't it extraordinary? In 2012 we are debating what on earth to do and where to put the waste materials from a reactor that was started up in the fifties under the Menzies government. They did not come up with a plan for the waste, just as they did not in the United States or the UK. The panel say:</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">Engagement and consultation with the public as well as commitment to an open and transparent approach since the very beginning of the process played a significant role and to date three communities in northwestern England (Cumbria CC, Copeland BC and Allerdale BC) have expressed their interest in being involved in the site selection process.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">So they have expressed interest in being involved, not put their hands up and then had this predatory government adopt the same processes that had been adopted by the Howard government to nail them to the wall in exchange for a cheque for 12 million bucks and improvements to a road.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I will go into a little bit more detail about how we see that this could be applied in an Australian context when we get to those amendments a little way down the track, because we have had a go at it. I am very happy to hear from Senator Scullion, from the minister and from other crossbenchers about how to improve those amendments.

The Territory can do a lot better and it deserves better. It is interesting to speculate on whether this would be going on if the Territory were a state, because the constitutional vulnerability of the Northern Territory is one factor—I recognise that it is obviously not the only thing, because there are many, but that is one factor—guiding the government's hand in this. They got kicked out of South Australia and they saw how strongly Western Australians arced up when the Pangaea Consortium from Switzerland turned up in 1999, and so they have attacked a constitutionally vulnerable Territory. Bring on statehood.</span>

But I am advised that, yes, we are very much aware of the blue ribbon commission process, and we understand that the United States is grappling with some similar issues to us. Equally, it is true to say that they are addressing the question of disposing of high-level waste in the United States and, of course, we are dealing with the management of low- and intermediate-level waste, so there are obvious differences in addition to the different legal and societal contexts. But I think it is fair to say that much of what you refer to reflects the same sort of approach we are taking here, which is a volunteerism approach. The report talked about encouraging communities to volunteer to be considered as part of its recommendations as well and, as I say, that is consistent with the sort of view we are taking here. I do not necessarily agree with the way you seek to use the commission report as though it somehow undermines the appropriateness of what we are seeking to do here. I think it is broadly consistent. As I say, that is to try to get communities to volunteer and to work with them to bring all that to a successful conclusion.</span>

I know you are used to the deliberative processes of the Senate, but I would not describe this as a ram raid. If this were a ram raid, certainly the culprits would have been caught long before they left the scene of the crime. One might suggest that the Greens might be pursuing a policy of trying to prevent the bill coming to a head and that they might be contributing to this, given the leisurely way we are approaching this legislation today and the way we approached it earlier. It is very clear what the position of the Greens is, and that is a perfectly appropriate decision for them to take. I think there is support around the Senate for the approach contained in this bill, and we would do well to get on and use our time wisely to debate it.</span>

                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Western Australia</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">13:17</span>):  I appreciate the fact that the minister has sorted that out and I look forward to getting a copy of it. I ask you to take on notice and put to your advisers, since they are here, the question that I was seeking specifically, given that the figures are up to date as of last October: what is the proportion of long-lived, intermediate-level waste, the spent fuel that is residing at the moment at Lucas Heights, compared with the amount that is due to come back from Europe, from reprocessing? My under­standing is that the proportion is approximately 15 or 16 to one. I am seeking advice on that, because it is going to be difficult for me to establish that while we are in the middle of the debate, unless the minister would care to adjourn the debate. If the advisers can just tell us whether that apprehension is correct or not and, if not, give us the appropriate numbers, that would be useful. I am not interested in the low-level material in this context; I am interested in information relative to what is being brought back from Europe—how much we have had sitting out the back of Lucas Heights for the last however long, decades or so.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Before I move to the Greens first amendment, I will take the minister up on one last thing he said in his response to my comments before—that in the United States they are dealing with high-level waste, whereas here in Australia we do not produce such material. That is something of a trick of definition. Australia is the only jurisdiction that actually adopted a classification of long-lived, intermediate-level waste. That is a classification that exists only in Australia. The Australian government did not want to say that we produced high-level waste; we produced other stuff called long-lived, intermediate-level waste. We obviously do not have commercial power reactors 10 or 100 times the size of the research reactor pumping out spent fuel, so it is not a question of quantity; it is a question about what the stuff is. It is spent fuel. It is fuel that has been burned in a fission reactor and then set aside because it is full of contaminants and is too hot to continue to be fissioned. It is spent fuel, so let us not pretend that we are producing some kind of benign material whereas in other jurisdictions they are producing other stuff. I will leave it there. My understanding is that the difference between the two categorisations that were invented for the purpose of diplomacy or convenience here in Australia is that long-lived, intermediate level waste, after it has been set aside for a while, does not require thermal shielding. It is not necessarily going to boil its way out of whatever you put it in as a high-level spent fuel will, but nonetheless it still requires active shielding from the environment and from all living beings until effectively the end of time. That is the material we are dealing with. Obviously, they are vastly smaller quantities than that of countries which, to their profound and internal regret, have a nuclear power industry, and I do commend the government for maintaining its position that there is no point whatsoever in entertaining such an industry here.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This amendment goes to the objects clause of the bill. From the objects clause flow the intent and purposes of the bill. An objects clause is commonly included in legislation to guide decision makers in the event of statutory ambiguity and to assist courts and tribunals in the same situation if there is a problem of statutory ambiguity. That evidence was provided by ANU lecturer Dr James Prest.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The Greens welcome the report of the Senate Legal and Constitutional Affairs on this bill calling for an objects clause to be inserted. So we have created the first objects clauses to emphasise the need for responsibility and for action to be taken to ensure that individuals, society and the environment are adequately protected against radiological and other hazards. This would apply whether the dump turns out to be a shed out the back of Tennant Creek with two security guards looking after it or if it ends up remaining, at least for a period of time, where it is. So when the material returns from overseas it is my understanding—and this was confirmed for us the week before last in estimates—that that material will at least be temporarily stored at a location in Sydney. Nonetheless, wherever it is, whether it is the people of Tennant Creek or the Barkly region or residents in Sutherland Shire that we are protecting, this should apply, and I will explain why we believe that that is important.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Radiological hazards are real. Ionising radiation damages our DNA. It is not good for living creatures. It damages the genetic material in all living cells. The nuclear age has introduced materials that emit radiation in forms that become airborne and are breathed in or find their way into the water table and the gene pool, entirely unlike naturally occurring background radiation.</span>

                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Nuclear reactors routinely release radiation as part of their normal operations. The facility in Sutherland Shire is no exception to that. For a long while—and perhaps the minister can tell us whether it is still in force—there was an exclusion zone around the reactor in which people were not permitted to produce food. I believe that was listed a while ago. I have had people ask me whether breastmilk qualifies as food. The reason for that is that all reactor facilities, no matter how large or small, as part of their normal operations emit very small but detectable trace amounts of various kinds of radioisotopes—iodine and tritium in particular.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Nuclear waste stockpiles, obviously, are growing daily, and the minister has given us some detail this afternoon about that in an Australian context. Elsewhere they include tonnes of plutonium which remain toxic for 250,000 years.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The International Physicians for the Prevention of Nuclear War know about radiation and the health effects of radiation. IPPNW won the Nobel Peace Prize in 1985 for their efforts to galvanise medical professions to cross the Cold War divide against the nuclear madness of that time. It is the legacy that we are still attempting to clean up today.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The 200,000 IPPNW medical professions in 60 countries have a clear position on both nuclear weapons and nuclear energy: they oppose both because there is no safe level of radiation. This thoroughly considered position arises from medical expertise, scientific facts, concern for future generations and simple common sense. Radiation is uniquely hazardous, persistent and indiscriminate, damaging our most precious legacy: the core human blueprint stored in our DNA and passed down through our children to future generations.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The scientific community today understands in 2012 what it did not fully comprehend in 1945: that there is no level of radiation exposure below which we are at zero risk. Widely accepted scientific evidence tells us that not only is the health risk from radiation proportional to the dose—that is, the bigger the dose, the greater the risk—but also there is no level without risk. Even very low-level medical exposure such as chest X-rays—0.4 microsieverts per test—carry a quantifiable risk of harm such as cancer. The International Commission on Radiological Protection recommends that all radiation exposure be kept as low as achievable in deference to this evidence. For the public, on top of background radiation and any additional medical procedures, exposure should not exceed one millisievert per year.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">A US National Academy of Science Biological Effects of Ionising Radiation report, the so-called BEIR or BEIR VII report, estimates that one millisievert of additional radiation is associated with an increased risk of solid cancers—that is, cancers other than leukaemia—of about one in 10,000; an increased risk of leukaemia of about one in every 100,000; and a one in 17,500 increased risk overall of dying from cancer.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">But a crucial factor is that not everyone faces the same level of risk: for infants under one year of age, the radiation related cancer risk is three to four times higher than for adults, and female infants are twice as susceptible as male infants; females' overall risk of cancer related to radiation exposure is 40 per cent greater than for males; and foetuses in the womb are the most radiation sensitive of all. It is relatively easy to understand why that is, because cell division proceeding rapidly in children or in the womb is enormously vulnerable to showers of radiation whether that be from any of the sources that the nuclear industry is producing or even from medical X-rays during pregnancy.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The pioneering Oxford survey of childhood cancer found that X-rays of mothers involving doses to the foetus of 10 to 20 millisieverts resulted in a 40 per cent increase in the cancer rate amongst children up to age 15. In Germany a recent study of 25 years of the national childhood cancer register showed that even the normal operation of nuclear power plants is associated with more than doubling of the risk of leukaemia for children under five years old living within five kilometres of a nuclear plant. Isn't that extraordinary—the normal operation? We are not talking a Fukushima-scale meltdown which requires the evacuation of hundreds or thousands of square kilometres of area. The normal operation of nuclear power plants in a country with the technical and engineering expertise of Germany has a doubling of the risk of childhood leukaemia of kids under five who will get cancer because they live close to a nuclear power plant operating as normal and spewing trace quantities of tritium, iodine and various other fission products into the environment.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Increased risk in those studies in Germany were seen up to 50 kilometres away from the plant, depending on wind direction, localised weather factors and so on. This was much higher than expected. It was certainly much higher than the nuclear industry was happy to acknowledge. It highlights the particular vulnerability to radiation of children in and outside the womb for reasons that I have spoken about. Nuclear research reactors such as the one in Sydney do not escape this. It is simply the engineering reality. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Uranium mining of course emits radon gas, so radiation workers in the uranium mines in Australia are among the highest exposed radiation workers in any sector of the nuclear industry around the world. Radioactive waste, the kind of material we are discussing today, emits radiation. Our amendment seeks acknowledgment of that and an object to protect health and the environment from that harm.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Radiation health authorities use scientific modelling to calculate and set permissible limits for ionising radiation exposure. As our understanding has increased, the recommended exposure doses for both the public and for workers in the nuclear industry have steadily been reduced. If you look at a graph over the last century or so—or at least half a century, 60 or 70 years—of permitted radiation exposure for radiation workers in the industry and for the public, they decline exponentially. Every couple of decades we cut the dose threshold by more than half or by a factor of up to 10. In other words, what we were being told was safe a couple of decades ago was not safe at all, and that is why people have very little confidence in what the industry tells us today. Radiation health authorities use scientific modelling to calculate and set so-called permissible limits for ionising radiation exposure and, as our understanding has increased, these levels have been reduced. These are permissible limits not for the prevention of disease but for allowing and enabling the industry to operate. Levels once regarded as safe are now known to be associated with those risks. It is now acknowledged in the medical literature that there is no safe level of radiation at all. No additional dose can be absorbed by a human being, or another living creature, without a measurable increase in risk of a cancer of some form.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The releases of radiation from the nuclear age have contributed to cancer plague of the 20th century. I do not ask the minister to stand up and tell us what that death toll is because it is simply not known; the studies have not been done, and it is formidably difficult to separate what causes are leading to what responses. But we know that genetic impacts are also discussed less frequently than cancer. Altering the collective gene pool of the biosphere of not just our species but also the species with whom we share the planet is not an experiment that is reversible. Once this damage is done you cannot take it back. We know that radio nuclides with long half-lives are cumulatively being loaded into the environment and may result in ongoing impacts on health, as well as long-term damage to the gene pool.</span>

I thought this facility would be controversial, because I do not think anybody in this chamber comes in here thinking that radiation is good for us, despite what some of the lunatic fringe elements of the nuclear industry might like us to believe. I would imagine that all participants in this debate would support at least the basic principles behind the objects clause that we are proposing, which says that, though we might disagree on the means, the purpose of legislation like this is to prevent these exposures to surrounding communities, whether they be in Barkly, Sutherland or on the transport corridor—wherever it is that the government eventually decides to put this material onto trucks and take out to Tennant Creek, or wherever. I would expect that all of us in here should at least be united in seeking to reduce the risk and the exposure to the host communities.</span>

My response to that is that this is not a best site argument; it is about a site based on volunteerism. Therefore, this amendment is opposite to the whole approach of the bill. The best site for a facility, if it exists, cannot be considered if it has not been volunteered. The establishment of a facility will take into account environmental considerations, geology, geography, hydrology, seismology, infrastructure and cultural heritage values, and these factors will be assessed under the Environmental Protection and Biodiversity Conservation Act and the Australian Radiation Protection and Nuclear Safety Act. All those safeguards are in place, but the whole structure of the act is to provide for a site being volunteered. The approach taken in the amendments proposed by Senator Ludlam on behalf of the Greens is contrary to the way the bill is structured.</span>

To contend with the concept that we should not be talking about waste minimisation because it is already happening, Minister, with the greatest respect, if that really were the approach of the Australian government we would not have built the second reactor; we would have phased out reactor based forms of producing medical radioisotopes and we would not be producing this material at all. That was the argument that many ran with in the debate at the time you were in opposition. In fact, the reactor that we have at the moment is a patched, leaking, poorly fabricated $600 million white elephant that we did not need. It has nothing to do with waste minimisation, because we are still producing more of it.</span>

The amendments that we are proposing to this bill go directly to the idea that we should not be producing this material any more than we absolutely have to. It does not dodge the argument that we have 60 years worth of this material's legacy to deal with. Before I proceed, I thank the minister for the material he tabled a short while ago on the basis of the joint convention on the quantities of material. I will just test the minister to see whether the advisers who are with him today are able to provide me with a breakdown or tell me where I can find in this report the proportions of the material that we already host here, that is already banked at Lucas Heights, relative to the amount of long-lived intermediate material, or reprocessed material, that has been returned from Europe.</span>

I can take on notice the question he has asked regarding the proportion of waste being returned compared to that which is already stored at Lucas Heights. I am told that the answer may not be as simple as it sounds because there is an argument about the form in which the waste will be returned and the measurement of that. I am advised that the volume of long-lived intermediate level waste held at ANSTO is 427 cubic metres and that the volume of reprocessed waste to return from the UK and France in 2015-16 is 32 cubic metres. If that is not absolutely correct, I will correct the record. But that is the officers' best endeavours at the moment, on the run. I think we are reasonably confident in the advice but, if it is not correct, I will correct the record as soon as I can.</span>

                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Western Australia</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">13:39</span>):  I thank the advisers, who have obviously just been flicking through the report. That bears out the point I was making. The sense of urgency that the government has been proclaiming—not just this government, but also the previous one—the justification for needing to dump this stuff in a shed on a cattle station, is that we have got this vast amount of material coming back from overseas and we have nowhere to put it, that there is nowhere for it to go, and that that is the deadline. Successive ministers have been using the urgency of this material being returned from overseas as a pretext for the claim that we need to set up a shed in the outback at Muckaty or whatever given site has been targeted. I have not worked out exactly what the proportion is, but I will take the minister's advice that there is 427 cubic metres of this material already banked at Lucas Heights, already sitting there, and an additional 32 cubic metres of this very long-lived lethal material due to come back in reprocessed form from Europe. We already have well over 10 times that amount of stuff parked at Lucas Heights. So what is the urgency? Where on earth does that come from? Could ministers stop using that as a pretext.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We heard again from the advisers, and from the officers who appeared at budget estimates the week before last, that this material, when it does come back, will be parked at Lucas Heights. It has been in the budget for at least two budget cycles that I am aware of. Preliminary studies have been done. ARPANSA consider their guidelines to be appropriate whether it is a remote site or a site at Lucas Heights. So that justification has evaporated. And it was actually never there in the first place because the same people spinning us that line knew very well that the material that was coming back from Europe was not going to be an enormous burden that was going to overwhelm our abilities, our management structures or our capacity at Lucas Heights to look after it. That was simply not true. I thank the minister for providing that information and for the fact that it is reasonably up to date. I trust that, if there are any amendments or significant changes to that, you will let the chamber know. I was not after a specific quantity down to the last kilogram, but you have given us the order of magnitude and that is appreciated.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We live in a naturally radioactive environment. The sun, and uranium locked up in granites, produces background radiation. But human activities from 1945 onwards have increased our exposure to ionising radiation, and entirely different isotopes and transuranic materials have been created that are vastly different from background radiation. So you cannot say that people who have been exposed to plutonium downwind of weapons tests are suffering from something that is just like background radiation only more of it. Plutonium did not exist on planet Earth, apart from in absolutely trace quantities, until we began producing it in uranium reactors for weapons. These isotopes are different from background radiation. They come in various forms that can become airborne and be breathed in, or find their way into the water table and gene pool, which is entirely unlike background radiation.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">For example, miners are exposed to radon in Australian uranium mines. They say that radon can come from very slow uranium decay in granites, which will sometimes build up in basements and so on, and therefore it is okay for workers to be exposed to elevated levels of radon because it is somehow natural. But if you grind up a uranium deposit, turn it into something as fine as talcum powder, disperse it across a mine site into a uranium mill, and the workforce breathe it in, they are getting quantitatively and qualitatively different levels of exposure. Because radon is an alpha emitter, it is going to be repelled or will not actually expose the worker to dangerous levels if it is coming from outside. Alpha radiation dissipates across a very short distance and can be stopped by skin or by the paper suits that people wear and so on. If you get that material inside you, if you pulverise that uranium deposit and convert it into a very fine powder, you have got a very serious problem because the material is resident in your lungs. Each link in the nuclear fuel chain releases radiation, beginning with drilling for uranium. To protect future generations from being damaged by it, we must stop creating more radiation and phase out the sources. We must also responsibly contain radiation from the environment. </span>

                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Instead of truthful data about radiation, over the decades we have received government denial, self-serving control of information and refusal to redress the shameful wrongs. Governments have not made archives of information available about Hiroshima and Nagasaki, for example. The French government has been equally shameless in the instance of the health databases from France's weapons testing in the Pacific. And, even in the instance of Maralinga, we are still fighting to provide a gold card for veterans who were exposed to radiation from weapons tests conducted by our ally Great Britain during the Cold War. So resolving the effects of nuclear activity and the nuclear threat is now a matter of our survival. We cannot contain nuclear threats or environmental damage or support the sick and dying without truthful information. We have other suitable objects clauses for this bill to ensure that the most suitable site on the continent is based on environmental considerations, geography, hydrology and so on. But the object embeds in the legislation that we need to find the right place. It would not necessarily be an earthquake zone—and Muckaty is in a seismically active area—and the locals would have told the minister that if he had had the courtesy to go and meet them and look them in the eye.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">You would not necessarily select a flood plain. I have obviously spent more time in Tennant Creek and the surrounds than the minister. I had the invitation from traditional owners, but when I tried to visit the site we could not get in because the area was flooded out. It does not sound like a particularly good idea for a shed.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">It would not be adjacent to or on top of a sacred site, as Muckaty is. Muckaty is a men's site and the men have been telling the government that through the kinds of letters that Senator Di Natale read in before and that I have tabled as correspondence from these people. They have been saying, 'Don't put that stuff there. It is not appropriate that it goes there.'</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">When the government promised to establish a process for identifying suitable sites—that is: scientific, transparent, accountable, fair, allowing access for appeal mechanisms, ensuring full community consultation in radioactive waste decision-making processes, committing to international best-practice scientific processes and so on—that was what the government committed to. Instead, we are seeing quite the opposite. Best practice involves putting this material where it is most appropriate, where there are the right characteristics. While it might be a politically convenient characteristic for the minister to be able to say that some people have nominated it, it does not make it the best place. A process that involves landowners, whether Aboriginal or non-Aboriginal, nominating lands or parcels of land as possible sites for a dump is not a scientifically rigorous process. This gets back to the debate that we were having before about the principle of volunteerism. I happen to believe that calling for volunteers from some of the most disadvantaged and marginalised communities on the planet is not the only alternative to simply walking in and coercively dumping it on somebody. What we have here today is the worst of both worlds.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">What we need in order to achieve 'international best practice'—since the minister has used that phrase a number of times—is a regulatory framework that strategically locates a site based on best science and risk management but also takes into account the impacts on economic and social issues. It should be one that applies strict criteria, standards and policies designed to deal with all environmental risks to the facility—very long-term environ­mental risks—and one which has input from and is acceptable to the community, not just something determined by Minister Martin Ferguson sitting in his electorate office in Batman while the clock on his turfing-out ticks down. The framework should provide constant vigilance, community oversight, risk removal, and prevention of pollution or contamination, rather than just project assessment, approval and condition, and it should provide a framework which deals with the residual risks, emergencies and contaminated lands if things go wrong. The objects clause would ensure that an overall object of the bill is to ensure that this material is not put where it is convenient but where it is appropriate, and that means for the stuff that is here and the material that is due to come back from overseas.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Unless Senator Scullion feels like making a contribution to explain why he does not think these very sound and sensible principles, which I am sure that he and his party agree with, should be embedded into the objects clause—principles that will guide the way that this bill is interpreted for the next several centuries—I will not detain this chamber any further. I hope we might at least hear something from Senator Scullion, or perhaps I have managed to change the minister's mind in the course of this short debate. Otherwise I commend this amendment to the Senate.</span>

It is not Lucas Heights, which I think is actually proscribed from being a nuclear repository in the ANSTO Act, but we have made it very clear that there are a range of reasons why we think we need to have a repository that deals with both the waste coming back and the accumulated waste that has been generated in Australia.</span>

What it will be is a facility that complies with the EPBC Act, four ARPANSA licences, best practice for management of radioactive waste, and a great deal of regulation and oversight. If for political purposes you want to refer to it as a 'shed', that is fine. I am just making it clear that I do not accept the description. This is something that will be managed to the highest international best practice with the regulation and approvals that are required before the site can be used, and I think that the senator is well aware of that. All those approval processes through the Environ­mental Protection and Biodiversity Conser­vation Act, or through ARPANSA's licensing arrangements and through the transport arrangements, will ensure that we have something far more satisfactory than perhaps the description of a 'shed' might imply.</span>

While the leadership issue went to a vote in the caucus today, there was a very clear endorsement of Prime Minister Gillard. But it is the case that those of us who are ministers are getting on with the agenda of the government, which is about creating jobs, providing a stable, growing economy, seeking social policies that improve the education and health of our people, and—another major agenda we have—increasing support for people with disabilities.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">The senior economic ministers last week continued their meetings on planning for the budget. I travelled internationally in support of Australia's bid for the Square Kilometre Array project. I continue to argue Australia's case for that important scientific initiative. The government is getting on with the important agenda it has for the nation. We are focused on the very important issues that are important to Australian families. Those are things like jobs and the education of their children. Those remain our focus. I am pleased to say of my own portfolio that next week we will see record numbers of young people attending university. There is a massive increase in the number of young people getting the chance to go to university to develop their potential, get opportunities for high-skilled and high-paid jobs and allow us to continue to grow the Australian economy because we are producing more people with a greater skill level, be that in the trades area or in higher education. Those are the things that I am focused on and those are the things that the government is focused on. We are getting on with the job of governing for all Australians.</span>

He does not serve the people of Australia by seeking to do that. This is his opportunity to ask the government questions about its programs and its policies.

I ask regarding the wild rivers protection in Queensland of Cooper Creek and Diamantina River, which provide, with the Georgina River, 90 per cent of the inflow to Lake Eyre in South Australia. The traditional owners have 100 per cent support for wild rivers protection. I ask the minister: in view of the clear intention of Campbell Newman, the Leader of the Opposition in Queensland, to throw over that protection, allowing the onrush of coal seam gas exploitation, what is the federal government doing to protect these extremely important catchments in line with the wishes of the traditional owners?</span>

The Australian government is supportive of measures aimed at protecting our nation's important biodiversity, heritage and environmental assets.

                <span class="HPS-Normal">Conservation of biodiversity and environmental protection through state and territory legislation is a matter for those governments. I am encouraged to see that the Queensland government is delivering on its commitment to establish Indigenous reference groups to consult with Indigenous people about potential wild rivers areas. In 2011, the Queensland government amended the Wild Rivers Act 2005 to provide a formal role for traditional owners in the wild rivers consultation process through the establishment of Indigenous reference groups. I understand that Indigenous reference groups will be established for the five new potential wild rivers areas that the Bligh government will progress if they are re-elected: the Jeannie, Jacky Jacky, Dulcie, Jardine and Holroyd rivers. This follows the establishment in late 2011 of Indigenous reference groups for the Queensland government's consideration of wild rivers declaration in the Coleman, Olive-Pascoe and Watson river areas. While I know there are a range of views about the Queensland wild rivers scheme among Indigenous communities in Cape York, I understand that there are many traditional owners who support wild rivers and who have welcomed Premier Bligh's announcement of 50 new wild river ranger positions.</span>

Australia has a growing economy, our net debt is less than a 10th of that of major advanced economies and our unemployment rate around half that of Europe. And this is a Labor government dedicated to ensuring that we support jobs and create jobs and that Australians have access to gainful employment.Those opposite might like to know that last month's employment figures, the labour force figures, showed the Australian economy created some 46,300 jobs in January and the unemployment rate fell slightly to 5.1 per cent. It was largest monthly increase in over 12 months, and this new jobs figure means that there are now more Australians in work, under this government, than at any time at the nation's history—something all of us can be proud of. It is an encouraging start to the year and a reminder that the Australian economy stands tall in the world, notwithstanding the efforts of those opposite to talk down the Australian economy and add to fear and anxiety because they always put their self-interest ahead of the national interest. </span>

We ensured we avoided recession. We saved hundreds of thousands of Australians from being on the unemployment scrapheap. Let us remember: had we taken the advice of those opposite, some 200,000 Australian families, some 200,000 people would be out of work. That would have been the position— <span style="font-style:italic;">(Time expired)</span></span>

That is why last year's budget invested some $3 billion in skills and training efforts to improve Australia's labour force participation and give more Australians the tools to participate in jobs today but, as importantly, in jobs tomorrow. It is why this government is investing in critical infrastructure including the NBN to drive productivity in our economy—something those opposite are committed to tearing down. It is why this government is spreading the benefits of the mining boom by introducing tax breaks for businesses which are not in the mining boom fast lane—tax breaks opposed by those opposite. The party of small business, the Liberal Party, is opposing tax breaks for small business, putting wealthy miners ahead of small business—that is the Liberal Party priority. <span style="font-style:italic;">(Time expired)</span></span>

We have made changes to the tax system to better reward effort and to encourage people to participate: three rounds of personal tax cuts worth some $47 billion. Someone earning $50,000 now pays $1,750 less tax than they did under the Howard government. And we on this side are building on this reform through our plans to triple the tax-free threshold in the coming years. Tripling of the tax-free threshold means a tax cut for every Australian earning under $80,000 a year—a tax cut opposed by those opposite.</span>

Is the minister familiar with the fundamental constitutional principle that the legitimacy of a Prime Minister depends upon having the support of a majority of the House of Representatives? Given that the Prime Minister does not have the support of 31 of the government's own members, including that of at least a quarter of her cabinet, and only has the support of, at best, a third of the members of the House of Representatives, when will she do the right thing, call upon the Governor-General, request a dissolution and allow the people to sort out the political debacle which the Australian Labor Party has created?</span>

Well, Senator Brandis, I have got some bad news for you. This government has been successful, despite being in a minority in the House of Representatives, at passing legislation and governing. What today's leadership ballot showed is the Prime Minister had very, very strong support inside the Labor Party caucus room. It was a very strong result that the Prime Minister received in the caucus meeting. </span>

Senator Brandis well knows that that situation continues—that the government is able to command a majority on the floor of the parliament and is a legitimate government.</span>

We will continue to focus on those issues and we will continue to deliver strong and effective government for the Australian people.

                  </a>  Mr President, on this occasion Senator Cameron's interjection is appropriate, if not orderly. He rightly reminds us that Senator Brandis is the last one to be asking this sort of question. As I understand it, he described the former Prime Minister as a 'lying rodent'. And I understand he voted for Mr Turnbull over Mr Abbott, and we might recall that that was a ballot which was won by one vote. So one does have to question the legitimacy and confidence in Mr Abbott when he can only win a ballot inside his party room by one vote.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I think that before Senator Brandis raises these sorts of issues he had better examine his own record in this respect. Again, this highlights the fact that the Liberal opposition are not focused on the issues of importance to the Australian people and that they are not focused on the issues of jobs and the strength of the economy. Really, they do those who voted for them a great disservice. <span style="font-style:italic;">(Time expired)</span></span>

Australia does not currently import any Iranian oil. Australia's trade with Iran has declined steeply and Australia remains committed to seeking a resolution of the Iran nuclear issues through negotiation. We urge Iran to follow through on its readiness to restart talks with the P5 plus 1. As others in the chamber have noted, I am not sure that the rest of the question was not drawn around the hypothetical suggestion, but, if there is any other information I can get from the minister's office, I will provide that on notice.</span>

There was not a great deal of detail to the question. Mr President, I ask a further supplementary question. I note that Australia, as the minister mentioned, has joined in sanctions banning Iranian oil imports from January. The foreign minister at that time indicated that Australia's exports to Iran have been reduced. Given that Australia sells uranium to Russia, which is the key strategic enabler of the Iranian government's nuclear program, whether it be civil or military, what is Australia doing to ensure that Australian uranium does not end up in Iran?</span>

We do not currently import any Iranian oil and our trade with Iran has declined steeply from about $1 billion in the late 1990s to under $300 million now. As to any plans that we have on the matter you raised, I am happy to seek some further information from the minister's office and see if there is anything to be added.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">New South Wales</span>—<span class="HPS-MinisterialTitles">Assistant Treasurer, Minister for Small Business, Minister for Sport and Manager of Government Business in the Senate</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">14:32</span>):  I thank Senator Sterle for his ongoing interest in supporting the small business people of Australia. The best way to support small business in this country is to have a strong economy and that is exactly what Labor is delivering. When you look at the international ratings across the board, all three ratings agencies, for the first time in this country's history, have given this country a AAA credit rating—something never achieved under the coalition in all their years under Prime Minister Howard.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">Look at inflation: contained. Look at economic growth rate, with a three in front of it. It is something that economies across the globe are envious of. We are moving forward. We are growing. Other economies are going backwards. Some in Europe are on the verge of default. At the same time, look at the unemployment rate in this country: 5.1 per cent in January. Forty six thousand jobs were created. Since we came to office: 700,000 jobs have been created. This is the Australian economy that Labor provides and this is the greatest benefit to small business.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Everything this government has done has been about supporting small business. During the global recession we acted to support small business, protecting 200,000 jobs. The stimulus package was about small business and about infrastructure to allow small businesses—tradespeople, electricians, plumbers and apprentices—to keep in work. It worked. On the other side of the chamber the Liberal Party and National Party senators walked into this chamber and voted against small business. They voted against the stimulus package that kept people employed and the multiplier effects that kept small businesses operating during that period. That is the record of the Liberal Party of this country. <span style="font-style:italic;">(Time expired)</span></span>

They will benefit from greater infrastructure and greater productivity through increased road and rail funding. They will also benefit from direct tax cuts that start on 1 July. But there will not just be a cut to the company tax rate; they will also benefit by an accelerated depreciation schedule, which will mean that they will be able to write off assets up to $6,500. The instant asset write-off is going to help the cash flow of small businesses. <span style="font-style:italic;">(Time expired)</span></span>

We have worked with states to try and develop a seamless national economy, with 36 reforms to reduce the regulatory burden on business. I am happy to say that one of these reforms is to implement the new national business names registration system later this year. It is on track to deliver major benefits to small business. At present, the average small business will be up for around $1,000 for three years. This will come down from $1,000 to $70—massive benefits for small business.</span>

The small business sector got some very exciting news last week when it comes to the National Broadband Network. I am happy to advise the Senate that on Tuesday, 7 February Optus released its NBN business plans for the small to medium enterprise sector. Optus's small business plans are going to provide SMEs with a vastly superior product offering because they will be delivered over the NBN. Optus are also offering additional web based programs to assist SMEs get on line that are not included in their current ADSL plans. In Optus's business entry level plan, they are even providing double the download data from 50 gigabits to 100 gigabits when compared to their equivalent ADSL product—all delivered over a fibre network, significantly increasing the experience of business in speed and quality of service. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Despite the ongoing scare campaigns waged by the opposition—specifically the members for Bradfield and Wentworth—that the NBN would increase the cost of broadband for families and businesses, Optus's business plans are priced the same as their existing broadband prices over copper. That is right, Mr President—the same. They first claimed residential prices would be unaffordable, and that has been proven to be false, and now the business plans released by Optus confirm the opposition has no credibility whatsoever—none when it comes to NBN pricing. You at least understood that, Senator Birmingham, and you did not make a goose of yourself. This is a very exciting time to be a small business broadband customer in Australia. </span>

Earlier today, Telstra launched their pricing and product services over the NBN. Telstra will offer a range of plans on the NBN's 25- and 100-megabit speed tiers with prices that, once again, are comparable to those Telstra offers today on their copper and HFC networks but with significant increases in speeds and quality of service. It is clear from Telstra's plans that they have confidence in the growing Australian demand for higher speeds and capacity. This demonstrates that the Australian telecommunications market recognises the reality that the coalition still refuses to acknowledge—that Australians require and deserve better quality broadband to help them engage with the digital economy. <span style="font-style:italic;">(Time expired)</span></span>

The tyranny of distance will no longer be a barrier to running a successful business in regional and rural Australia.

The reality is that the government is getting on with the job. This government has successfully managed the economy. We have created more than 700,000 new jobs. We have an economy that is the envy of the world. Whenever you travel internationally, people want to know how we did it. How was it that our response to the GFC allowed us to come through in such strong condition? They want to know how our stimulus plan was so successful in ensuring that Australians kept their jobs and kept working. They want to know why we were so successful at achieving growth in employment while the rest of the world was experiencing unemployment rates of 10, 12 and 14 per cent. This government has been successful at managing the economy, allowing the economy to grow and providing jobs and opportunities for Australians. What we know is that this is in stark contrast to the opposition, who have no policies. They can only criticise. They can only oppose everything that is done. But we are getting on with the job. We have actually put a price on carbon. It comes in on 1 July. It is a major economic and environmental reform that will see this country set up to take advantage of a clean energy future. It will transform our economy for the long-term benefit of Australians. We are getting on with those things. The Senate will get the chance to debate the mining tax in the next few weeks. This will allow the Liberal Party to make a decision about whether they are going to give the revenue from the mining tax not to the Australian people but to the miners. They will have to slash the education and health budgets to give the money back. I will have a quiet bet with you, Senator Ryan, that you change that policy before the election.</span>

I also refer the minister to comments by Graham Bradley, the Chairman of Stockland and HSBC Australia, who said that this 'is not what the government needs while we face major structural challenges in the economy'. For how much longer will the government put its self-interest and its infighting ahead of the economic interests of Australia?</span>

When it comes to health and hospitals the Gillard Labor government delivers to all Australians, including those living in rural and regional areas. That means better access to health services and infrastructure and more health professionals on the ground. Through the regional priorities round of the Health and Hospitals Fund the Gillard government is bringing modern practice and better facilities to remote and regional Australia. Through the regional fund, 63 projects are sharing in $1.3 billion in funding. This means that facilities in Tennant Creek, Townsville, Port Lincoln, Sheffield, Kerang, Geraldton, Bega and many more will receive invaluable funding for better services, increased infrastructure and economic development. The priority round builds on the $3.2 billion already allocated through the Health and Hospitals Fund right across Australia, where one-third was given to regional Australia. The Gillard government is delivering 24 regional cancer centre projects, including two additional centres announced in the 2011 budget, for Geelong and Albury-Wodonga. While the government is delivering spending for infrastructure and getting the best facilities for our region, we are also ensuring that our regions have health professionals on the front line delivering in those facilities. To attract health professionals to our regional areas we are delivering training and incentive packages. The government's $134.4 million Rural Health Workforce Strategy is designed to encourage doctors to work in isolated rural and remote communities and to keep them there. As a result of this strategy in 2011, almost 8,000 doctors were assessed as eligible to receive an incentive payment for the first time. </span>

The Senate would be aware that when it comes to health and hospital reform the Gillard government has made reform happen—unlike those on the other side when they were in government. We made these reforms in a Labor way, which means not leaving rural hospitals behind. We will deliver a more efficient health system through activity based funding, but we also make specific allowances for rural hospitals to ensure services continue to be provided and improved. That is why some small rural hospitals will continue to be funded by block grants where activity based funding would not maintain community service obligations. A significant proportion of our health reform funding is being directed into specific rural health programs; for instance, $12 million over four years for additional rural allied health scholarships—</span>

Of course, there is no doubt that the biggest risk posed to longstanding health and hospital reform is those on the other side: the opposition—the Liberals and the Nationals. I have outlined the tremendous amount of investment that the Gillard Labor government is bringing to regional and rural Australia. This is in contrast to the record of Mr Tony Abbott, whose team only cut, cut, cut health and hospital funding. Mr Abbott as health minister cut $1 billion from the health budget and now Mr Sloppy Joe Hockey has got to find another $70 billion in cuts, and guess where they are going to come from?</span>

                <span class="HPS-Small">That the Senate take note of the answers given by the Minister for Tertiary Education, Skills, Science and Research (Senator Evans) and the Minister for Broadband, Communications and the Digital Economy (Senator Conroy) to questions without notice asked by the Leader of the Opposition in the Senate (Senator Abetz) and Senators Brandis and Birmingham today relating to the Labor Government and the National Broadband Network.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">I noted three truths as I was going around the streets last night to grab a meal. One was that Prime Minister Gillard would win the vote today quite convincingly, and she did. The second was that Mr Rudd would get around 30 votes, and he did. The third was that Mr Shorten is currently planning to have another pitch at the leadership within six months, which he will. These things are absolutely obvious.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Whilst I was away during the floods, people were asking me who was pairing me. Apparently it was Dougie Cameron. He was doing a great job bringing down the government. He was hard at work with some other people. Obviously a whole range of them are out there basically tearing themselves apart. The problem with that, of course, is that our government has been cut loose. Our government is on autopilot. The metaphor that kept going through my head whilst I watched this fiasco, this disgrace—which in former times was supposed to be called a government—was what it would be like to go into an accountancy practice to find one partner screaming at the other partner, kicking over the photocopier, throwing cups of coffee and hurling the staplers around the office. And the other partner would be decrying them and absolutely pulling the rug out from under them—saying quite clearly that the partner was incompetent, that they obviously struggled, that they had no method, purpose or discipline and that they were chaotic. And then both of them would look at me and say: 'But we want your business.'</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">It is a remarkable thing to look back and find that Mr Swan has said that Mr Rudd was 'dysfunctional in his decision making' and that he was 'deeply demeaning in his attitudes towards other people'—obviously the perfect candidate for the Minister for Foreign Affairs. That is what we want: we want to take that chaos to a global scale. That is the decision that an obviously competent government makes. And then I ask the question: wasn't this the government that saw us through the GFC? Wasn't it the steady hand of Rudd at the tiller that got us through the GFC? Surely it cannot have been just the Chinese demand for our resources that got us through the GFC. No, it was Mr Rudd and ceiling insulation; it is so obvious, it is so clear. That is what got us through. The trouble is, of course: they are still there. I look at them today and there is Senator Cameron and Senator Conroy. I could not have done a better job myself than Senator Cameron did on live television this morning. It is beyond belief that this totally dysfunctional outfit is running our country. It is a disgrace—and that is the word I picked up on the street—what they are doing to our country. They are hopeless.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Whilst they have been using Australia as a plaything like a ball of string, our gross debt has gone beyond $229 billion. We borrowed an extra $2.3 billion just last week. The week before we borrowed $3.3 billion. The week before that we borrowed in excess of $2 billion. Our limit is $250 billion. You promised you would never get near it and you are racing towards it. Whilst this fiasco is happening in the foreground, something very serious is happening in the background. Who do we believe these days? Who do we honestly believe? The question has to be asked whether there was a lack of truth about the position of the government and the key officeholders in the past. Was that not the truth or is it not the truth now? The two stories are completely and utterly incongruous.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">For Kevin to say that the bickering and destabilisation must stop, there is a good idea; that is a great idea. It started way back in the last election and has been going on ever since. Were they not the people who got rid of him? Was he not the elected Prime Minister, Mr Emerson? What was that, Mr Emerson? Was that just helping him out a bit? This destabilisation is endemic. Once the ingredients are in the Mixmaster, once the political intrigue is afoot, you can never get the ingredients back into the packet. <span style="font-style:italic;">(Time expired)</span></span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">

                  <a href="00AOS" type="MemberSpeech">
                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Senator STEPHENS</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">New South Wales</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">15:09</span>):  I am very pleased to be taking note of the answers given to questions asked about the Gillard government because it gives me a great opportunity to put to bed this nonsense that we have been hearing from the opposition. Regardless of all the confection and outrage that we have been hearing over the last few days, we happen to be one of the strongest economies in the world, which is a credit to the work of the Labor government since being elected in 2007. All of the nonsense that goes on about whether it is a Rudd government or a Whitlam government—a Freudian slip—or a Gillard government plays out in the media very effectively, while the people who are depending on us to run a good government, a strong government and a strong economy are working men and women, the decent people of Australia, sitting there waiting to be reassured they are going to be looked after. We are the government that has done that so effectively.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The Australian economy has been the clear standout in the world since the GFC. We still have the lowest unemployment rate: 5.1 per cent, compared to 8.3 per cent in the US and more than 10 per cent in Europe. The tragedy of those stories we saw roll out across Europe in Spain, Germany, Portugal and Italy, particularly about youth unemployment, was the challenge that we recognised here in Australia during the GFC. We had the challenge of keeping young people at school or earning. We made the investment to ensure that we did not have a lost generation of young people, as that was the fundamental challenge that confronted us in the global financial crisis. Since the GFC, our economy in Australia has grown by more than seven per cent. Minister Arbib said today that we have a rating of AAA from all the rating agencies, something the Liberal government was never able to achieve and cannot admit is the successful hallmark of the government.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">As we heard today in question time, more than 46,000 jobs were created in January alone. We increased our employment rate and maintained our unemployment rate of 5.1 per cent, thereby showing that the investment pipeline is strong for Australia. Our economy is intact. We had a $913 billion investment pipeline in the December quarter. Business confidence is strong and growing. Consumer confidence is growing. All we hear from this opposition is nay saying. All they do is take every opportunity to talk down the economy in ways that give people a great sense of fear and anxiety about their future.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">What have we heard from the Governor of the Reserve Bank, Mr Stevens, and the people who make decisions for all of us in our economy recently? They say our rate of employment is sound, we have strong economic fundamentals and we need to invest in the infrastructure that is going to underpin our future. What is that infra­structure? We need critical investment in our transport infrastructure, in our ports and mining infrastructure and in our NBN infrastructure, which are going to make sure that we have a vibrant, strong economy.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The idea that we have to sit day after day and listen to Tony Abbott and the opposition with no policies, no vision for Australia, and no strategy for the future is what is driving people demented. The leadership discussion is over and done with. The leadership issue is finished today. Let us not forget that Mr Abbott won his leadership challenge by one vote, so 49 per cent of his colleagues did not support him in his leadership battle. Let us not worry now— </span>

                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Senator BUSHBY</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Tasmania</span>—<span class="HPS-MinisterialTitles">Deputy Opposition Whip in the Senate</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">15:14</span>):  I also rise to take note of ministers' answers as mentioned by Senator Joyce. It was great to hear Senator Stephens today trying to defend the Australian government's record, particularly as it relates to the economy. I did not hear anywhere amongst that contribution references to the great job that Peter Costello and the previous Howard government did in handing over a government that had over $70 billion in the bank and which has now been turned into a situation where we are looking at a gross position of over $200 billion in the red and getting worse every day by about $100 million.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I also did not hear her explain why she voted for Mr Rudd this morning. Does she agree with her colleagues who have made a number of statements about the government? I would like to look at a couple of them. The Minister for Resources and Energy, Martin Ferguson, said that Mr Rudd can win an election against opposition leader Tony Abbott and that Ms Gillard cannot. He said that he was:</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Small">… supporting him to try and save the Labor Party from itself. It's about trying to work out how we can best position our party to remain in government.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Similarly, Mr Rudd himself said:</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Small">If Julia is returned or if I'm elected, then I think it's time for various of the faceless men to lay down the cudgels.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">Does Senator Stephens, who was supporting Mr Rudd, agree with these statements? Does she still agree with those perspectives? Does she think it is time for the faceless men to lay down the cudgels? I would have been very interested in hearing that. Has she maybe changed her mind the last couple of hours?</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Senator Stephens also talked about the coalition nay-saying. Can I say that over the last week I have never heard so much negativity and nay-saying in politics. Today we had confirmation that almost one-third of the Labor caucus—and that includes Senator Stephens—does not have confidence in the Prime Minister. If you went out and polled Labor supporters around the country, you would probably find that even more than one-third of those Labor supporters would not have confidence in the Prime Minister. Today is the end of the most extraordinary five days in Australian politics, certainly in recent years. It was the peak so far of tensions and divisions that have been building in the Labor Party for months and have at their core the ruthless and efficient removal of then Prime Minister Kevin Rudd and his replacement with the current Prime Minister in June 2010.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">As interesting as of all of this theatre is, the great tragedy is that the current government—a government that was put in place with the complicity of rural Independents, particularly and specifically because they thought it would be more stable and more long lived than the coalition alternative—finds its own issues, its own problems, its own internal divisions and its own electoral standing to be more engaging and important to it than the challenges that the nation currently faces. There are real challenges out there, including challenges for small businesses that are trying to make a dollar, trying to employ people and trying to pay them so that they can pay their mortgages. It comes back to the cost of living pressures that Australians are currently facing. But is the government interested in this? No, it is far more interested in spending all its time worrying about its own internal problems—worrying about personality issues and egos within the Labor Party and worrying about who is going to run the party—than worrying about what impact that will have on the needs and the challenges being faced by the Australian people.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Labor say that all of this internal division and infighting has not impacted on the government.</span>

                  </a>  I hear Senator Polley making interjections along those lines. They say, 'Look at all the legislation that we have passed since we came in,' and they point to all these new acts that have passed. Most of that legislation was non-controversial. It was passed with the full support of the coalition and it is legislation that we would have put up if we had been in government and which would have been supported by Labor. The vast majority of it passed without any issue. There were bits and pieces here and there, but on the whole it would have been very similar if we had been in government. Those that have not been non-controversial or have not gone through with bipartisan support are largely bills that were passed as a result of dirty deals that were done with the Independents and the Greens to get government.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Two of those in particular were bills which were passed despite specific promises before the 2007 and 2010 elections that they would not be. Of course, I am talking about the carbon tax, about which the current Prime Minister—even after this morning—went to the last election, hand on heart, saying, 'There will be no carbon tax under a government I lead.' Yet she introduced one. Now they are going around saying it is one of their main achievements. Similarly, there was the slashing of the private health rebate. Before the 2007 election they said, 'We will not touch it; we won't do a thing'. Now they have. They have broken another promise, and they say that is another one of their great achievements. <span style="font-style:italic;">(Time expired)</span></span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Western Australia</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">15:19</span>):  I am very proud of this government's record, both under Kevin Rudd and under Prime Minister Julia Gillard. We have much to be proud of, and Senator Joyce should not be lecturing us on stability, given his track record. A government is not a popularity contest. It is about making the right decisions in government for the national interest and for the Australian people, and that is something that this Labor government consistently does. We are a government that have been able to make the hard decisions—decisions in the national interest, in the interests of Australian families and in the interests of Australian jobs. We have a strong and functioning government. We have the many hundreds of bills that have been passed—major reforms that have passed the House of Representatives and indeed this chamber. We have a strong and effective government, a government that is getting on with governing and that has wheels that have kept turning.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We also have plans for the future. We have a strong Prime Minister. We have a committed and tough PM, and we have a big agenda. No. 1 at the top of our agenda, our top priority, is managing our economy. It is about giving working people a fair share of our nation's mineral resources. It is about getting our nation ready for the future—for the new economy that we know is emerging. They are difficult decisions because they are difficult things to balance, but we are managing the economy for working people and for jobs—just as we did during the global financial crisis under Kevin Rudd. Now, as you can also clearly see, we are doing it in the manufacturing and auto industries, unlike those opposite. We as a government will maintain our disciplined fiscal strategy. It is about delivering a budget surplus in 2012-13, and those opposite have no plan for the future in this regard. They have a $70 billion black hole, and they cannot deliver a budget surplus for this nation. Labor, on the other hand, is able to build on the fact that, for the first time in Australia's history, we have joined an elite group of countries which hold a AAA credit rating from all three global rating agencies. These are important things for our national interest.</span>

There are terribly contradictory things out there in relation to their agenda. Would they have supported schools around the nation to create jobs? I think that was an incredibly smart thing to do. What we saw during Building the Education Revolution was projects of a scale that meant we could roll them out and create jobs quickly. Had we invested it in large infrastructure, we would not have been able to roll out and create those jobs as quickly. But what we have seen is 9,000 schools around the country benefiting from what was an economic calamity, and we created hundreds of thousands of jobs around the country. This government is committed to infrastructure in public transport, unlike those opposite. <span style="font-style:italic;">(Time expired)</span></span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">
                  <a href="J7Q" type="MemberSpeech">
                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Senator BACK</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Western Australia</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">15:24</span>):  If anybody did not believe the dysfunctionality of this Labor government, they need only have listened to the answers to questions this afternoon by Senators Evans and Conroy and the interjections of Senator Wong. We have seen an admission of the dysfunctionality of this government, and you can just start with Senator Evans himself and others in the field of employment. They omit to mention that in the year 2011 employment flatlined in this country; there was not any increase. They very proudly talk about a minuscule increase in employment in the first month of 2012. That is January; that is the month when everybody leaving school is seeking work. Of course, they also omit to mention—although both Senator Evans and Senator Pratt are Western Australian senators—that all of that increase came from the state of Western Australia. They conveniently overlook what was happening in south-east Australia in manufacturing and in the car industry. Unemployment figures in this country are a disgrace to this government. If you look at underemployment and at those who are not participating, those who are not seeking work and those who have been reduced to part-time employment, you get the actual figures in employment participation.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We look at the question of debt. The Labor government, only four years ago, inherited a surplus of some $70 billion, no net debt and no deficit. In that space of time they have increased the indebtedness of this country to $230 billion. The taxpayers of this country need to understand that, even if that figure stops now, we will be paying back $15.4 billion a month in principal and interest for the next 20 years—$15.4 billion a month. This crowd on the other side have some gall to talk to us about fiscal responsibility. Surplus? They would not know what a surplus was. In 2007 they inherited a very sound economic situation. They ask us to compare America and Europe now to how Australia is now. Ask them how America, Europe and other parts of the world were in 2007.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Now we see the imposition of both carbon and mining taxes. Senator Pratt spoke of the car industry. Did she mention that last year, 2011—a record year for sales of cars in this nation—we actually manufactured less than 20 per cent of all cars sold, 200,000 out of one million? We manufactured fewer cars last year than we did in 1957. And what is the carbon tax going to do? It is going to add a cost $400 per car. So, if we manufacture 200,000 cars, there will be an $80 million increase in cost. But what about the 800,000 cars that will come in from overseas that will not be the subject of a $400 carbon tax impost? And we see that it goes on. There is a lack of business confidence in this country. If people want to start talking about confidence in manufacturing, in retailing and in the tourism sector, they need only pick up the newspapers once we can get this terrible government off the front page.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">In the long, sad and lamentable litany of lies that we have seen out of the Labor mouths in the last week, the one that absolutely got to me was the comment of the past Prime Minister—the deposed Prime Minister, now a backbencher—Mr Rudd in which he said that Mr Abbott doesn't have 'my temperament or my experience to govern'. When I heard that I said, 'Thank God!' Imagine the temperament of Mr Rudd, with language that I have not heard in shearing sheds or stockyards coming out of Mr Rudd's mouth. When it comes to experience, it is an interesting point to note that when Mr Abbott becomes the Prime Minister of this country he will have had more ministerial experience than any other Prime Minister coming into that position in recent Australian history. That is what we in the electorate have had to put up with over the last few days.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We once again have imposed on us a Prime Minister who went to the last election saying, 'There will be no carbon tax under the government I lead,' the same person who said, 'I will not interfere in the private health rebate.' Of course, we have seen her doing exactly that. We see a circumstance in my own state—and how disappointing that the last speaker herself did not draw attention to the damage being wreaked upon the state of Western Australia by this federal Labor government. Why? Because they will have no seats. <span style="font-style:italic;">(Time expired)</span></span>

              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Small">That the Senate take note of the answer given by the Minister for Broadband, Communications and the Digital Economy (Senator Conroy) to a question without notice asked by Senator Ludlam today relating to Iran and nuclear weapons.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">My first question to Senator Conroy, the minister representing the Minister for Foreign Affairs, was not answered. I asked whether or not our government has a position on military strikes on Iran. My second question was not answered. It was: what have we done to express such a position to the United States government or the Israeli government or through multilateral forums? This question was also not answered: what are we doing to ensure that uranium sales to Russia from Australia do not end up in Iran's nuclear facilities? While it is an open question as to whether or not Iran has an active nuclear weapons program, why we would be selling uranium to their key strategic enabling supplier of technology is absolutely beyond me. We do not know if Iran is developing a nuclear weapons program. The regime has consistently denied that it is doing so. In fact, it has even said that nuclear weapons are un-Islamic. I would add to that that they are un-Christian, they are un-Hindu and they are un-Buddhist. They are, in fact, anti-human weapons.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The International Atomic Energy Agency, after years of inspections, has not concluded whether Iran is developing such technology or not, but it did say last week that Iran has not been fully cooperating. The IAEA has been saying for many, many years that it is not getting the cooperation that it needs from the Iranian regime. What is clear, of course, is that Iran could pursue nuclear weapons technology if it wanted to, because the technology for producing nuclear fuel for enriching uranium up to fuel grade is the same technology used to enrich uranium up to weapons grade. I have probably lost track of how many times I have had to make that point in the chamber. The technology for producing fuel is the same as the technology that produces weapons. The only difference is political intent and political will.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The problem, of course, is that once a country has been supplied a nuclear energy program or develops one indigenously it is quite capable of developing a weapons program. The expertise is there, the training is there and the materials and so on are there. That is one of the reasons that the Australian Greens oppose not only the rampant prolifer­ation of weapons but also the proliferation into all parts of the world of civil nuclear energy. Military strikes have never been a successful way to rid the world of weapons of mass destruction. The 1981 bombing of the Osirak facility in Iraq is a good example. The program was delayed by the bombing, but, of course, it then went underground. The Iraqi government took it underground with the result that, whilst Osirak had been monitored by the IAEA, subsequent Iraqi activities in pursuit of nuclear weapons was not monitored. Through Israel bombing this facility, the Iraqi regime simply became more determined following those air strikes and committed more human and economic resources to an underground nuclear weapons program. So we have an example of what happened before. The Greens are opposed to all nuclear programs whether they be weapons or energy programs, and we have been publicly critical of Israel's clandestine nuclear weapons program, just as we are in the instance of allegations of a uranium weapons program. It is clear, however, that this lack of even-handedness from other policymakers here in Australia and around the world is absolutely exacerbating the situation. There is a clear lack of effort and a clear lack of action on behalf of the existing nuclear weapons states, declared and undeclared, on their disarmament commitment and obligations under the nuclear non-proliferation treaty. It is obvious that some countries in the standard discourse are to be trusted with nuclear energy and others are not, and it is very easy for a country like Iran to hide behind the kind of nationalistic rhetoric that we are seeing and assert that it is doing nothing different from any number of other countries, and that part of the story is true.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The only way that we are going to solve the problem is for there to be serious further debate on how to create a nuclear-free Middle East, and this includes Israel. Of course, this is a conversation that is already decades old. It is incumbent on the other nuclear weapons states and the five permanent members of the Security Council, in particular, to lead the way by diminishing and eliminating the role of nuclear weapons in security doctrine and taking concrete steps to eliminate the nuclear weapons arsenal. There are 22,000 or thereabouts of these weapons, many of them vastly more powerful than the devices that were exploded in 1945. Iran is obviously currently a signatory to the NPT, so our challenge there is to stop it violating an agreement that it is a party to. Israel, of course, is a different situation.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The Australian government must end uranium sales to Russia if it is serious about stopping Iran from acquiring nuclear weapons. The Russian nuclear industry built Iran's Bushehr plant and continues to work with the Iranian regime closely. Many other countries, starting with the United States government but including Germany, Argentina and Spain, led the way and helped the Iranians develop the technology that we now ask them to phase out.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Small">I am pleased to introduce this bill which seeks to reverse the commercialisation of SBS. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">Established in the 1970s, our second national broadcaster was the first multicultural broadcaster in the world. Australia's relative success as a multicultural society is owed in part to institutions such as SBS which tell the stories of our cultural diversity and reflect a uniquely Australian experience back to those who have made a home here. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">From the outset, SBS was a publicly funded broadcaster and advertising was not permitted. It wasn't until the Special Broadcasting Service Act of 1991 that advertising was permitted during periods before programs commence, after programs end or during natural program breaks for a maximum of five minutes. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">Over 7 million viewers and listeners who enjoy SBS in 60 languages per week have consistently lamented that their news, drama, sport and content that portrays and appreciates our multicultural society is interrupted by advertising  </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">In 2007, due to financial pressures the station moved – arguable in contradiction of its Act, in spirit if not in letter – to full in-program advertising. This has degraded the SBS viewing experience. As long as advertising revenues continue to rise, the danger is that successive Governments could get away with the structural under-funding of the station. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">This Bill seeks to wind back this trend so that SBS enjoys adequate funding to take full advantage <span style="&#xD;&#xA;    color:#000000;&#xD;&#xA;  ">of the education, employment and creative opportunities provided by digital multi-channeling and the NBN. </span></span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">
                    <span style="&#xD;&#xA;    color:#000000;&#xD;&#xA;  " />Considering it operates on less than a quarter of the budget of the ABC, SBS provides an extraordinary service of which we can all be proud. However, the troubled history of its hybrid funding model has reached a dangerous new stage.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">Senators will be aware that this is the second iteration of a bill to remove advertising during programs from SBS. In the first iteration, I did not deprive SBS from revenues from advertising per se, rather I simply proposed the abolition of advertising on SBS during  'natural program breaks', in other words, restricting advertising to before and after programs.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">Schedule 1 of this new bill clarifies the definition of 'natural program break' to bring advertising practices at the station back into line with the Parliament's original intention when debating the Special Broadcasting Service Act (1991). </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">Schedule 2 of the bill proposes a staged approach in which a proportion of additional funding in the forthcoming triennium will be set aside to retire advertising. How much is retired is at the discretion of station management. The bill proposes to allow the Minister by regulation to set aside a proportion of SBS funding for this purpose. In this sense the bill does not appropriate funds, it merely sets up a scheme whereby the station can use a proportion of future funding increases to wind back advertising that runs during programs. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">Schedule 3 of the bill holds that by the funding triennium after the one commencing in 2012, advertising within programs will have been phased out altogether.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">
                    <span style="&#xD;&#xA;    font-family:;&#xD;&#xA;  ">SBS radio will not be affected by this Bill</span>
                    <span style="&#xD;&#xA;    font-family:;&#xD;&#xA;  ">. </span>
                  </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">The Greens are on the record as supporting an increasing in base funding to support the health of the station and to reduce the amount of television advertising it carries. The 2012-15 triennial funding round provides an opportunity to reset the course of SBS and cement its position as one of Australia's most important cultural assets. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">Competitive pressures have now sharpened with the introduction of digital multi-channels, cannibalising advertising revenues and bidding up the price of appealing content. Since FY 09-10, advertising revenue growth rates have stagnated and are predicted to fall steeply into decline as highly profitable commercial broadcasters with thousands of hours of airtime to fill hoover up all available content and heavily dilute the value of advertising. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">Ironically, the arrival of the commercial multi-channels was smoothed with a surprisingly generous public subsidy to the tune of $250m in waived licence fees for two years. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">The Australian Greens believe it is essential in the next funding triennium to reverse the tide of commercialisation, before declining advertising revenues and rising viewer discontent force a crisis on the broadcaster. In addition, to thrive in an increasingly crowded and converging media market, SBS requires an injection of funds above and beyond that sufficient to end in-program advertising. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">Analysis of answers requested at successive budget estimates sessions reveal that additional public funding of $45 million per year would be required to achieve this (see answer to Question 60 from Budget Estimates Hearings May 2011). This estimate is difficult to verify and does not necessarily model the increased 'scarcity value' of more restricted advertising timeslots at the top and tail of programs. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">Withdrawing advertising could be achieved in a phased manner across the triennium, allowing the station in the short term to use the funding increase to address urgent priorities including first-run Australian content, expanded online services and an expanded slate of Aboriginal content through a proposed tie-up with NITV. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">

                    <span style="&#xD;&#xA;    font-family:;&#xD;&#xA;  ">In framing this Bill, great regard has been given to do so in a manner that does not harm SBS. The Bill does not direct SBS to stop placing advertisements in television programs. It merely provides station management with an option to do that in exchange for monies already appropriated </span>
                    <span style="&#xD;&#xA;    font-family:;&#xD;&#xA;  ">by the Parliament for SBS. If SBS exercise that option, it would be akin to the government buying out all the breaks in a program, while still allowing the station to top and tail programs with advertisements. </span>
                  </span>

In the event that SBS receives a substantial increase in their funding, which we hope is the case, the station will be required to use a portion of this funding increase to retire advertising during in-program breaks</span>

                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Senator BRANDIS</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Queensland</span>—<span class="HPS-MinisterialTitles">Deputy Leader of the Opposition in the Senate</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">15:41</span>):  Some among us in this chamber will remember the late Rob Chalmers, the longest serving member of the parliamentary press gallery, who began his career when Ben Chifley was the leader of the Australian Labor Party in 1950 and who died last year. When I was a young senator I was befriended by Rob Chalmers and I remember having a conversation with him one day when I was very excited about a particular political event—I cannot remember what the event of the time was. He looked at me in an avuncular and indulgent way, I think, a little amused at my excitability about a transient political happening. He shook his head wisely and said, 'Ah, George, there was nothing as good as the split.'</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I think—and if I can conjure the shade of Rob Chalmers in the chamber this afternoon—the extraordinary events that we have seen in the last six days which have riven this Labor government apart will be viewed by historians of the future as events that rival the split. Never before in Australian history, certainly never before in the living memory of any member of this chamber, has a political party been so deeply, so bitterly, so publicly, so poisonously divided as the Australian Labor Party has been in the last several days.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Of course it has only been public in the last several days, but we now know from the mouths of the principal protagonists themselves that this has been going on all along below the surface but not very far below the surface: the government of Australia was a seething well of hatred and poison and personal bitterness and animosity and distrust. I actually feel sorry for the decent people in the Labor Party that they have had to put up with this. We had some disputes on my side of politics in 2009, and I know how trying they can be. I know how corrosive of personal relationships they can be, but, if I may say so, nothing that has happened on the coalition side of politics ever, going back to the days of John Gorton and Billy McMahon and the early 1970s, even approaches this in its bitterness—an observation that comes not just from my side of politics but from Labor Party observers like the former Senator Graham Richardson himself. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The Australian people deserve better than this. It does not matter if they are a coalition supporter, a Labor supporter, a Greens supporter or a genuinely unaligned swinging voter; the Australian people deserve better. They deserve a government that conducts itself with even a minimal level of professional competency and skill. They deserve cabinet ministers for whom the conduct of the nation's business is a higher priority than fighting factional wars for control of the Australian Labor Party. They deserve better than to have the government of the nation consumed by internal power struggles and political games. At a time when the global economy is teetering on the brink of another crisis, they deserve better than to have a Treasurer who devotes his time to blackguarding his historic rival and enemy in Queensland Labor politics, Mr Kevin Rudd.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">At a time of acute diplomatic difficulty in various parts of the world, including the possibility of a war in the Middle East, the Australian people deserve better than to have a foreign minister who is being white-anted by his own Prime Minister and her surrogates to the extent that he feels forced to resign as foreign minister. They deserve better than to have a Prime Minister whom her own ministers and her own backbench have felt so strongly to be untrustworthy that they have declared that fact to the Australian people. Mr Kevin Rudd, the senior politician of the Labor Party most favoured by the Australian public, put it very plainly when he said, three days ago:</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Small">Julia has lost the trust of the Australian people.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">And so she has.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Let it never be forgotten that the only reason Ms Gillard became the Prime Minister of Australia on 24 June 2010 was that she lied to Mr Kevin Rudd when she assured him that, as his deputy, she would support him to the hilt. Mr Rudd learned to his cost how worthless that assurance was. Having secured the leadership of the Labor Party, and the prime ministership, by a political coup executed in the dark of night, Ms Gillard then fell across the line at the 2010 election and was elected as Prime Minister, albeit in a minority government, only because she lied to the Australian people when, on 6 August 2010, a few days before the election was to be held, she looked down the barrel of a television camera and said:</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Small">There will be no carbon tax under the government I lead.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We know that had she not said that, had she told the truth about her intentions, she would not have been re-elected. She seized the leadership of her party through deception and she was elected as Prime Minister in 2010 through deception.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Then, in the political circumstances of the minority government, she only managed to parlay her position into a commitment from the Independents because she told Mr Andrew Wilkie, the Independent member for Denison, that she would support his measures for poker machine reform. The moment, late last year, that the Labor Party, through whatever devious means—I hate to think of it—convinced Mr Peter Slipper, the member for Fisher, to neutralise his vote by becoming the Speaker, giving them one more vote on the floor of the House of Representatives, she dumped Mr Andrew Wilkie, and Mr Andrew Wilkie now says he was betrayed.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">How do you beat that, Mr Deputy President? She became the Prime Minister in the first place because she lied to Kevin Rudd. She fell over the line at the 2010 election because she lied to the Australian people about the carbon tax. She was able to form a government in the hung parliament because she lied to Mr Andrew Wilkie about poker machine reform. Mr Rudd was spot on when, three days ago, he said:</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Small">Julia has lost the trust of the Australian people.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">There will be an attempt, no doubt, to paper over the cracks and, Humpty Dumpty-like, to pretend that the pieces can be put back together. But I dare say that nobody would be so silly as to believe that the hatreds and the vendettas and the poison that beset this government, which have torn it apart in a public spectacle unprecedented in Australian history, will be easily washed away. We know that they will not be. We have a situation in which Labor elders like Senator John Faulkner, Mr Martin Ferguson and Mr Robert McClelland—three senior Labor politicians, all of whom I know and like and respect—have all, in their different ways, declared or acted on their lack of confidence in the government of Prime Minister Gillard. There are so many scores to settle. There is so much hatred, antagonism and poison bubbling below the surface.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">This government is dysfunctional. Its ministers are not on speaking terms. Its ministers publicly denounce one another's lack of integrity. Its ministers are incapable of guiding the affairs of this nation. When there is a political deadlock like this in a democracy there is only one way to resolve it: take it to the people and let the people sort out the mess the Labor Party has created. <span style="font-style:italic;">(Time expired)</span></span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">
                  <a href="e5x" type="MemberSpeech">
                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Senator POLLEY</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Tasmania</span>—<span class="HPS-MinisterialTitles">Deputy Government Whip in the Senate</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">15:52</span>):  I rise to refute the nonsense of this vague and incomprehensible matter of public importance. The internet is a wonderful invention; you can look up almost anything, and instantly there is a response. I did not have to look very far to find an interesting definition of 'dysfunction' on dictionary.com: 'any malfunctioning part or element: <span style="font-style:italic;">the dysfunctions of the country's economy</span>'. Well, fancy that! There it is, in black and white, for all of us to see. So let us see what really is true. We can see it in this motion from Senator Fifield, the Manager of Opposition Business in the Senate—a member of a coalition government that squandered the opportunities in our nation's budgets between 2004 and 2007. Their only interest was pork-barrelling at election time. What would the coalition have done in the global financial crisis? They would have done absolutely nothing. Those opposite, at that time, said we should sit back and wait. They wanted to put their heads in the sand.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">But what did we do? We took the action the Australian people elected us to take. The Gillard government's first priority has been to keep the economy strong by delivering jobs and growth and helping Australian workers. Labor made the right decisions during the global financial crisis to keep people in jobs and deliver economic stimulus to drive growth. We have created over 750,000 new jobs since 2007. We have the right plan now to keep the economy strong and drive future growth to help working people.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Would the coalition have cared if hundreds if not thousands of Australians had lost their jobs during the global financial crisis? Of course not. All they are interested in is big business and their mates—like those in the tobacco industry. Donations are clearly far more important than the Australian community.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Let us have a quick look at what this government has achieved. Those opposite say we should go to an election. The reality is that we have 18 months to the next election, and you have 18 months to come up with some policies to change the Leader of the Opposition's mantra of 'oppose, oppose, oppose'. I might not have time to go through everything, but let us just put things in context. We are about the future, whereas Mr Abbott and the opposition are about taking us back to the 20th century. I said we have created 750,000 jobs since 2007, and we have 140,000 more Australians employed today than we had 12 months ago. The economy is strong. We have bulletproofed the Australian economy and kept it out of recession during the worst economic downturn in three-quarters of a century. Thanks to this, our economy's fundamentals have remained strong, with outstanding employment growth and record investment. We are committed to a return to surplus next financial year.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Mr Deputy President, you would know how favourably the National Broadband Network has been received in Tasmania. It will mean affordable, high-speed broadband for all Australians no matter where they live and for all Australian businesses no matter where they are located. It will mean better education, better health care and better access for Australian businesses to the biggest marketplace in human history.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">With our health agreement, we have more doctors, more nurses, more beds, less waiting and less waste, together with better accountability and community control—achieved through a historic health deal with the states at COAG. Our agreement on the carbon price will cut pollution and create clean energy jobs.. It will cut taxes and increase the pension to support the Australian economy. This is Australia taking responsibility among the nations of the world.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Our mining tax will give Australians a fair share of the mining boom—a boost to retirement savings, tax breaks for small business and company tax cuts. These again are things that those opposite oppose.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We have doubled our investment in school education, upgraded facilities at every school and provided more information for parents than ever before.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">On skills, we are investing $2.4 billion in the Building Australia's Future Workforce package to create 130,000 new training places—new participation measures that provide opportunities but also demand responsibility.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">For seniors, there has been a historic increase in the pension, and now we are looking at improving aged care to give older people more choice and control. Those opposite failed miserably to protect our older Australians over their 11 years in government.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We have made a record investment in our infrastructure of more than $36 billion around the country. We have laid the foundations for a National Disability Insurance Scheme. The 2011-12 budget delivered 95 per cent of our election promises, as well as returning the budget to surplus in 2012-13. Some of the savings measures will not be easy but we will be delivering the biggest fiscal turnaround in 30 years. We have invested $2.2 billion in a mental health package to deliver additional services and a greater focus on prevention and early intervention.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">And the big thing we did for Australian workers and families was getting rid of Work Choices—but we know the opposition's plans for future attacks on Australian workers. We have cut taxes in the last three years for working families and low-income earners. Someone earning $50,000 a year now pays $1,750 less in tax than they did in 2007. Interest rates are still lower than they were when the Liberals left office.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We introduced Australia's first ever paid parental leave scheme, giving new parents more time with their children and reducing the financial pressures on families. We have increased the childcare rebate to 50 per cent.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Meanwhile, what have we seen from the coalition? They oppose the mining tax. They oppose more superannuation for workers. They oppose tackling global warming by pricing carbon and Australia playing its role in the world. They oppose investing in the National Broadband Network. They oppose health reform, and they are even backing away from something as important as the National Disability Insurance Scheme.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Instead, the three finance stooges of the coalition already have a $70 billion problem to deal with. Savage cuts will adversely affect everyone. Cuts will be needed to pay for the $11.1 billion in forgone revenue from axing the mining tax. They want to give back the mining tax to some of the world's biggest and most profitable mining companies and, in the process, stop an increase in superannuation savings for Australian workers. And $24 billion will be needed to refund the big polluters for the carbon permits they will have bought for their pollution.</span>
              </p>

According to the Australian Institute of Health and Welfare, Australian government expenditure on public hospitals increased every year from approximately $5.2 billion in 1995-96 to over $12 billion in 2007-08. And from 1995 to 1996 annual spending on health and aged care by the Australian government more than doubled from $19.5 billion in 1995-96 to $51.8 billion in 2007-08. Senator Polley, next time you come in and lie to this chamber, get your facts right.</span>

The point I wanted to make, Senator Polley, is that you know every time you come in here and parrot that absolute codswallop it is wrong, because you cannot even bother reading the data that has been put out by the Australian Institute of Health and Welfare.

                <span class="HPS-Normal">I now come to the point in order, which is the motion before us about the dysfunctional government. I begin my comments by quoting the <span style="font-style:italic;">Canberra Times</span><span style="font-style:italic;"></span>from 27 February, not that I often quote the <span style="font-style:italic;">Canberra Times</span>:</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">These are the words of venom and vituperation that spewed forth from Labor ranks over the last week, directed at former Prime Minister Kevin Rudd and his brand of leadership, spoken by a cabal of his closest cabinet ministers. We saw the charge led by none other than Minister Roxon and I will come to some of her comments in relation to health in a moment. We had Mr Swan unleashing on Mr Rudd minutes—just minutes—after the latter resigned from his portfolio, accusing him of sabotaging the 2010 election. We had the member for Bendigo, Mr Gibbons, referring to the former Prime Minister as a psychopath. And the list goes on. Sources say, in an article by Samantha Maiden:</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Small">Kevin Rudd described Julia Gillard as a "childless, atheist, ex-communist" at an Adelaide pub as he plotted a political comeback a year ago.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">As everybody was scurrying to deny it, one of the lawyers present at that occasion is prepared to sign a stat dec to that effect. They were all in denial, of course, about this so-called reality of what is now the Labor Party and comments that were made barely a month ago were denied. Now the real gloves are off and we see that a third of Ms Gillard's caucus has now voted against her and a quarter of her cabinet do not have confidence in her.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I come now to health. Through the mouth of former health minister Nicola Roxon, we have had an enormous insight into what has become an example of ramshackle decision making under the Rudd-Gillard Labor government. In Senate estimates I prosecuted this issue in February 2010. I asked questions about whether there actually was a health plan when the Rudd government came to power. There was certainly no plan. There was not even a plan on the back of an envelope. Of course, the officials were quick to deny all of this but the reality is that out of Minister Roxon's mouth we now know just how ramshackle it was. There was not actually a plan. There never was a plan for health reform.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Indeed, in one of many interviews that Minister Roxon gave she talked about the shambolic lack of proper cabinet processes. Processes were not used. She said:</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Small">Some very big decisions were being contemplated, in health in particular, that's of course the closest experience that I had, that often there was an inclination to want to go and announce those things without there being proper cabinet discussion or consideration of the downsides rather than just some of the political or potential upsides.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">And we have seen the example of Mr Rudd wanting to go to a referendum, knowing that a referendum on the takeover of health would not succeed. He thought it would be a good tool to be able to win the election. The cynicism!</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">One cannot but be cynical about the way this government operated. On another occasion in an interview, Minister Roxon referred to Mr Rudd's choice to have a referendum about taking over the health system 'knowing full well and agreeing that that referendum would be lost but thought it would be a good tool to be able to win the election'. Mr Rudd was prepared to have such a cynical approach to this.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Again, on Sky News, Minister Roxon was asked by Kieran Gilbert about the rigmarole of a referendum. She agreed absolutely. Minister Roxon said that Mr Rudd had sat there with Karl Bitar and everybody else and said, 'Look, this is a really popular thing to do; we would win the election.' She went on:</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Small">I said, ‘Yeah, but we wouldn’t win the referendum. Look at the history of referendums.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">This is the sort of cynical stunt that the Rudd-Gillard government were prepared to do in health. And those opposite trumpet the so-called good things that they have done in health! This is what it was all about.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">It was all about the photo opportunities. Then Prime Minister Rudd and then health minister Roxon were going out there for the photo opportunities. That was all it was about. If they really cared about the health of this country they would have taken a serious approach in relation to proper health reform. They knew that they would not get the consent of the states to do it but they went along just for the politics of it.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">It is very clear from the comments that Minister Roxon has now made that health was only one of the examples. This was what they did in relation to their so-called big health reforms. Ms Roxon went on to say, on Sky News on 24 February:</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Small">... he wouldn’t get proper legal advice, he wouldn’t let officials properly prepare the pros and cons and if you don’t do that then you can’t actually assess what risks are involved for Government or the public in going down a course that might be populist and politically successful but ultimately will end in tears.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">That is the approach that this government has taken in relation to health, which was supposed to be one of their most important reforms.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I thank Senator Brandis for his note. He has just informed me that Senator Arbib has just announced that he is resigning from the Senate forthwith. Well they are descending; it is much more shambolic. It will be interesting to see. I wonder if Senator Arbib is going to write a book and tell us the truth about some of the shambolic recent history in New South Wales. I wonder if it is going to be as interesting as the book that Morris Iemma and former minister Costa have written: the real truth about New South Wales.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">With all of this happening it is little wonder that, irrespective of the result today, there will be no peace and harmony—that they will all be 'happy little vegemites' to quote former Prime Minister Rudd. I do not think that will be the case.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">As Martin Ferguson said, he knows that the faceless men will still be in charge. There will be one faceless man fewer now, Senator Mason, because Senator Arbib is going. But those faceless men are at work today, and they will be at work in the future, because they just cannot help themselves. So, I say to this Prime Minister that the issue at hand is about our government and our future. Let's go to an election.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">New South Wales</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">16:12</span>):  Last week I had the great pleasure of touring the beautiful electorate of Cowper on the North Coast of New South Wales. I was up there opening some brand new educational facilities at a number of schools.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">On Thursday I visited Bellingen High School to open their brand new hospitality trade training centre—a $1.5 million investment by this government in better educational facilities for students in that important rural and regional community in New South Wales. I went through and visited their first-class industrial kitchen. I sat in their cafe. I sampled some of the produce of the students—the wonderful coffees that they were making. I talked to the students about the fact that they now have the ability and the choice to begin their apprenticeship whilst they are still at school, giving them a great advantage for a future in a trade in the local community.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Later in the afternoon I travelled to Maclean High School, where I was fortunate to open their brand new construction trade training centre. That is a $1.3 million investment by the Gillard government in first-class vocational education and training facilities for students in rural and regional New South Wales. I spoke to the local builder, the head contractor, who had been involved in the construction of that first-class facility. He told me about the importance of this program for his local community—about the fact that he as a local builder was able to keep on a large number of his employees because of the government's commitment to jobs in local communities and to better education facilities for students in rural and regional New South Wales.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">On Friday I then travelled to Willawarrin Public School just west of Kempsey. It is a small school with only 60 students. I did a tour of the facilities with their wonderful school captain, young Hayden. He showed me their brand new library, a first-class library that has just been constructed, with their wonderful new video conference facilities. He told me that the week before the students in that tiny school had had a video conference with the staff at the Sydney Opera House about their music program. A number of other local schools in that community had plugged into that video conference to tour the facilities of the Sydney Opera House, to learn about its music program, to learn about how productions are put together and how they are rolled out on a particular day—all from the convenience of their school library. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I toured some of the classrooms and the students showed me their brand-new smart boards: how they interact on those smart boards and how they can do programs like mathletics to make mathematics more enjoyable. I spoke to the principal about the benefits of these wonderful new facilities not only for the students but also for the local community—the fact that 80 workers from the local community had secured jobs on this important project and that it ensured during the difficult period of the global financial crisis that many of those local builders, architects and designers were kept in employment. They were also providing an investment in a better education for the kids in their local community. I also toured Kempsey East Public School, which had a $2.125 million investment in a new school hall, and Smithtown Public School with a $925,000 investment in better classroom facilities. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I drove past the work that is going on on the Kempsey-to-Frederickton bypass—a $618 million investment by the Gillard government in a dual carriageway on one of the most treacherous stretches of road on the Pacific Highway. Some 394 pylons are being driven into the ground to provide the largest road bridge in this country—2.3 kilometres of road bridge. Some months ago I was fortunate to drive in the first pylon on that very important piece of infrastructure for rural and regional Australia. Through that investment, 450 jobs were created. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">In two days I witnessed $625 million worth of investment by the Gillard government in rural and regional New South Wales. During that time, of all the people I met not one of them mentioned the ALP leadership issue. They were much more interested in the services that their government was delivering for families and communities. The main game in the community is policy development and policy delivery, and it should be the main game in this place as well, particularly when we are talking about matters of public importance. This debate is meant to be about the issues that matter to the people of Australia. When it comes to matters of public importance, Labor has a clear policy plan to meet the challenges of the future, to keep our economy strong, to grow jobs, to ensure that the benefits of the mining boom are shared equally amongst the community, to support small businesses and to support the disabled and their families into the future. Our plan is affordable and it is costed and we are happy to have it independently scrutinised by the Parliamentary Budget Office or any other independent auditor of election costings. That is unlike those opposite who do not have a policy agenda, who cannot explain to the Australian people their policy on workplace relations and who cannot come into this place and clearly enunciate what their education policy will be. I have just mentioned some of the investments this government has made in better education facilities for students in rural and regional New South Wales. Australia-wide, the government has invested $16.2 billion in better education facilities through the Building the Education Revolution.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Those opposite cannot come into this place and enunciate what their policy plan will be on one of the most important areas of public policy in this country. They cannot tell us how they will deal with climate change; they consistently resort to a student-politics mentality of seeking to debate goings on in, and what is being backgrounded to, the media in this place. There is no greater example of that than the incompetence in their approach to fiscal policy. At the last election they refused to submit their election costings for independent scrutiny. When they did, they came up $11 billion short. When they had them independently audited, their accountants also came up short, and later on the accountants were fined for breaches of accounting standards. That pales into insignificance when it comes to what those opposite have planned for Australia. From the very little policy that has been leaked from the shadow cabinet meetings, we do know that they are planning $70 billion worth of cuts in services. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">When we talk about matters of public importance there is no greater matter of importance to the public than the cuts those opposite have proposed to service delivery in this country. They should come in here and tell the Australian public what they are planning to do with the childcare rebate, an important support from government that helps families get by—particularly those in the early years of child rearing. They should tell us what it means to pensions when they talk about $70 billion worth of cuts to services. They should tell us what it means when we have a plan to increase superannuation and they are planning to cut $70 billion worth of services. They should tell us what it means when we are planning cuts to the company tax rate and they will not agree to those cuts.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We often get into vigorous debate in this place and we criticise each other about what is happening in our parties, but on the issues that really make a difference to the lives of Australians—the real matters of public importance—it is policy that matters to the Australian people. When it comes to policy and when it comes to comparing the different policy agendas of Labor and the coalition, the contrast is stark. We will always come to the conclusion that Labor is doing a good job when it comes to policy development.</span>

After the brutal battles within the Labor Party in the last week, there is no question they are dysfunctional. It reminded me of when the former United States Secretary of State Dr Henry Kissinger was asked about the very bitter war then being fought between Iran and Iraq. He said that it was a pity that both sides could not lose. I have no doubt that most Australians today, having seen the result of the battle between the Prime Minister and Mr Rudd, wish both of them could lose—because the public has certainly lost. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I am in a somewhat generous mood today, even if the public might not be. I happen to agree with both Ms Gillard and Mr Rudd, and indeed their supporters. I agree with them all. My good friend Senator Conroy—he is one of my favourites, as you know—said:</span>
              </p>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Senator Conroy was right. What a pity he did not make that public 18 months ago or three years ago or four years ago. That is what a senior member of the Labor leadership group says about the alternative Prime Minister and alternative leader of the Australian Labor Party, Mr Rudd. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">My fellow Queenslander, Deputy Prime Minister and Treasurer, Mr Swan, said:</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">

                  <span style="&#xD;&#xA;    font-size:9.5pt;&#xD;&#xA;  ">The Party has given Kevin Rudd all the opportunities in the world and he wasted them with his dysfunctional decision making and his deeply demeaning attitude towards other people including our caucus colleagues.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">Again, I agree with Mr Swan. I do not have any doubt that that was Mr Rudd's conduct. But this all came out in a leadership contest—the most bitter I have ever seen; I have never seen a contest as bitter as it—a long time after the event. I only wish my Labor colleagues had had the courage to bring this up when it really mattered: three or four years ago, when a dysfunctional person was running the government. </span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">That is another senior minister talking about the Labor Party's most popular Prime Minister ever. Only now does the truth seep out from senior members of the Australian Labor Party about the most popular Labor Prime Minister there has ever been.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Ms Gillard the Prime Minister said that Mr Rudd had displayed 'very difficult and very chaotic work patterns as Prime Minister.' She added that he had sabotaged her 2010 election campaign. Yet again, that is correct. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">These are the people charged with running our country. They are not talking about the issues that matter. My friend Senator Thistlethwaite spoke about matters that do concern the community; but those things have not been concerning the Labor Party for the last six months. Mr Rudd has been running around, as Ms Gillard says, undermining her and the government. Their focus has been on each other and on their own jobs, not on the concerns of the community.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">As you know, I like to be catholic in my approach—somewhat eclectic. So let us look at the other side. One of the senior ministers voting for Mr Rudd today was the Minister for Immigration and Citizenship, Mr Bowen. He said, 'I do believe Kevin Rudd has a lot to continue to offer.' He might continue to have a lot to offer to the opposition—we do not complain about the political effect of Mr Rudd—but he has a devastating effect on Australia, its government and its people. That is the problem. So I agree with them all; but what a shambles. These are the people who are supposedly administering this nation.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We have one of the largest economies on earth. All of us know that this is a time of increasing pressure on families. The cost of living is going up because of the carbon tax, which is one of the great disasters in Australia's history. It will go down as an absolute and utter debacle. Job security, particularly in manufacturing, is becoming increasingly difficult. The boats keep coming; border security remains a huge issue; that has not changed. The mining tax will be debated, as Senator Evans said today during question time. 'If it moves, tax it,' says the Labor Party. The mining tax will not solve Australia's problems. Taxing does not solve a nation's issues. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">So what has changed? Nothing has changed. The problem with the Labor Party ever since Mr Rudd won the election in 2007 is very simple: they cannot implement anything. The implementation of their policies has been a shambles. The pink batts program was perhaps the classic. It cost $1 billion to implement and $1 billion to fix. The NBN has to be a shambles. I will put a bet on the public record that that will be a shambles—and it will not be worth it. In my own area, in the Building the Education Revolution, I heard what Senator Thistlethwaite said. This is the problem: everyone knows that those school halls cost too much. The government's own adviser said that they cost too much. Do you know what is even worse? It was in state schools where the money did not go very far at all. The government secured much better value when it was dealing with Catholic schools and independent schools. Why is it that government schools cost up to 60 per cent more per square metre than Catholic or independent schools? What is even worse is that the Auditor-General's office said that there were not sufficient oversight mechanisms within the Commonwealth department of education to ensure that the Commonwealth got good value for money. That is the greatest indictment of this government in four years: after spending $16 billion, the Auditor-General said there were not sufficient oversight mechanisms to ensure the Commonwealth government secured good value for money in government schools, because the state governments could not administer the money well. That was the problem. But don't believe me; look at what Mr Orgill said. It is all very well to say, 'People thought it was a great idea but we spent all this money.' The trick in government is not to spend money. That is easy. I actually find spending money pretty easy myself. The trick is to spend it well, because for every dollar a government spends, taxpayers deserve a dollar in value at least. And they did not get it out of the BER. That is the problem. It is true.</span>

They always have more debt upon leaving government. That has happened every single time since 1901. They always leave Australia with more debt. That is the great failing of the Labor Party and social democratic parties in Europe. And aren't we paying for that now?</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">
                  <a href="5K4" type="MemberSpeech">
                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Senator FAULKNER</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">New South Wales</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">16:33</span>):  Let me say that I believe this Labor government is a good government. This is no better demonstrated than by the government's sound management of the Australian economy and by the long list of key policy achievements since its election some four years ago.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">It is very easy for an opposition to say that a government is dysfunctional. But just consider how Australia currently compares with other advanced economies in the world. The Labor government has steered Australia through the worst global recession since the Great Depression more than three-quarters of a century ago. Unemployment is low—currently at 5.2 per cent—and employment growth is strong. Unemployment is lower in Australia than in any every major advanced economy of the world, bar one. Some 750,000 jobs have been created since Labor was first elected more than four years ago, including 100,000 in the last year alone, and the government is on track for the creation of another 300,000 new jobs this year.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Growth is steady with a strong investment pipeline. Debt is low. Australia has a budget position that is literally the envy of every other nation in the Western world. Inflation is contained in this country, and interest rates under the Labor government have reached lows never seen by the previous coalition government. Importantly, as I have said before in this chamber, for the first time in our history Australia has received a AAA rating from all three global ratings agencies—something that was never achieved by the previous coalition government.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">It would not be surprising to anybody that the opposition has proposed this matter of public importance today. As you would expect, the opposition is trying to exploit the fact that we in the federal parliamentary Labor Party had a leadership ballot today. Well, such events are part and parcel of politics. Since I have been in parliament I voted in six leadership ballots: the two challenges by Paul Keating to Bob Hawke, Kim Beazley's challenge to Simon Cream, the ballot between Kim Beazley and Mark Latham, Kevin Rudd's defeat of Kim Beazley, and, of course, today's leadership ballot. I am a traditionalist, and that is a nice way, I suppose, of acknowledging that I am a relic from the past. And I have always refrained from publicly or privately canvassing the respective merits of those who are contesting leadership ballots. I am afraid I have to disappoint my friends in the gallery; I am not about to start now. I will, however, say that I have the greatest respect for all the Labor prime ministers that I have known and I believe that each and every one of them deserves our gratitude for their efforts on behalf of our party and our nation.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">On the other side of the chamber, I have seen Andrew Peacock, John Hewson, Alexander Downer, John Howard, Brendan Nelson and Malcolm Turnbull come and go. I have seen others desperately covet the leadership but not have the guts to contest it—Peter Costello comes to mind there. I have seen Tony Abbott win a leadership vote, the ballot he won in fact by one vote after preferences, against two of his most senior colleagues. So, yes, we have leadership ballots just like the Liberal Party and the Nationals have leadership ballots. And, yes, the Labor Party fights and, yes, the Labor Party fights such ballots hard because the stakes are high. We fight hard because we are passionate in our beliefs. We fight hard because in Labor's broad church so many different views are heard. Like other  political parties, the Australian Labor Party has internal processes to resolve itsdifferences. Those processes have been in operation again today. They have worked again today as they have worked in the past.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">So the bad news for the Liberal Party is that, just as has happened in the past after a leadership ballot is done and dusted, differences will be put aside and members of the government will work together in the national interest. This is the way the Labor Party works. We respect the outcome of democratic processes in the party, in the parliament and at the polls. The Liberals have never done that. They will never acknowledge that Prime Minister Gillard has been voted for by the majority of the Australian voters, the majority of members of the House of Representatives and the majority of my caucus colleagues. They can spend as much time as they like denying reality. While they do that, this government will get on with the job of delivering for Australia.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">
                  <span style="font-style:italic;" />How extraordinary in this matter of public importance debate that the three coalition speakers—Senator Brandis, Senator Fierravanti-Wells and Senator Mason—have themselves been such warriors in internal Liberal Party leadership ballots. Senator Brandis could not stand John Winston Howard. He called him a 'lying rodent'. Senator Mason had similar views. He  probably did not do as much backgrounding as Senator Brandis did  against Mr Howard, but his view was well known. Senator Fierravanti-Wells undermined Mr Turnbull when he was the Leader of the Opposition virtually every minute of every day. Well, I do not think it does any of us any good to have that level of  hypocrisy in the chamber. As I said before, leadership ballots are part and parcel of Australian politics. What I say is that after they are over, a responsible political party  gets on with the job. In the case of a political party that forms government, it gets on with the job of governing. That is what the Gillard government will do: get on with the job of delivering for Australia. <span style="font-style:italic;">(Time expired)</span></span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">This is a very important report. Indigenous disadvantage and Indigenous disconnect are the reality in many parts of Australia and require a commitment not only from individuals but from governments at all levels of Australia to address. When the previous Prime Minister, Prime Minister Rudd, made a commitment to produce a report on the first day of parliament in every parliamentary sitting year on the status of closing the gap, this commitment was certainly welcomed across the political divide. It was viewed as an opportunity to assess how government programs are working, what the community acceptance involvement is and whether or not we are actually closing the gap. Unfortunately, most of the reports to date have concentrated on inputs: how much money has been allocated or spent and how many initiatives have been announced. I have to say in defence of the Labor Party that in the first couple years I could probably understand why that might be the case; we have to get a database. But we have been at this for some time now and it has become apparent that the government now seems to believe that the hard work stops when the announcement has been made. I think all Australians would know that in fact the opposite is true.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">An example is the government's $100 million Indigenous antismoking initiative. We know exactly what is being spent, but we have no real idea about how it is actually working. We do not know—neither does the government—the exact details of what is happening. We have the details of how much money is invested but absolutely no details at all about how many people have stopped smoking, how many people are attempting to stop smoking or the variety of communication mechanisms between Indigenous Australia and the government. Why can we not be told about the effect of the program? After spending the amount of $100 million one would expect that we would know what works and does not work. By the time we get to the end of the program it is going to be too hard to make any changes, so we definitely need some interim targets as the long-term closing the gap<span style="font-style:italic;"></span>targets of 10 to 20 years will mean nothing if we cannot assess how we went last year or will go in the next year. The important trend lines, particularly in closing the gap, are something that I do not think we have developed fast enough and are certainly something that we really need.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">An example of that is the halving of the gap on year 12 completion by 2020. At the moment, we measure how many people will graduate this year and then we try to do a projection which is, in my view, pretty worthless. There is a much better way to do it. What we need to do is measure how many kids are in and passing grade 5 this year, because they are going to be the same students who will go through year 12 in 2020. The reason I use that particular example is that attendance records and NAPLAN results for that particular age group indicate that we have already failed to meet the 2020 target. The number of kids who have been retained in year 5 and who are actually passing year 5 is not even at 50 per cent, so we have clearly failed the target already and do not have to wait until 2020 and say, 'Oh, we've got it wrong. Let's go and do something more about it.' It is very important that we change that approach. The <span style="font-style:italic;">Closing the gap</span><span style="font-style:italic;"></span>report needs to highlight all of this information as well in the glossy brochures. It has plenty of pictures but very little qualitative data, and that needs to change. It does a disservice to both the Australian public, who want action, and Indigenous Australians, who deserve action.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The <span style="font-style:italic;">Closing the gap</span><span style="font-style:italic;"></span>report should also contain data that describes where we are right now. There should be data not designed to attribute blame or shame people but to remind Australia why we need to work so hard to address disadvantage and disconnection. It should be data, disturbing as it may be to some, such as that provided by the Children's Commissioner, Dr Howard Bath. This data was provided in Dr Bath's submission to the Senate Community Affairs Legislation Committee inquiry into the Stronger Futures in the Northern Territory Bill 2011 and two related bills, and it is a salient reminder about why we must continue to intervene in Indigenous affairs. The Australian Early Development Index, the AEDI, provides a population based developmental assessment of children in their first year of school. It explains that those with multiple developmental vulnerabilities will require special assistance in order to benefit from regular schooling and all the lifelong benefits that schooling provides.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">To get an idea, across Australia, 11.8 per cent of children have multiple developmental vulnerabilities—and one of the fundamentals of that is that if you are raised in an environment where you feel safe and confident then you will not fall into multiple development vulnerability. Within the Northern Territory, 46.8 per cent—that is nearly half—of all Indigenous children have developmental vulnerability on more than one developmental domain. That is half of Indigenous children across the entire Territory, but in remote communities the number of children assessed as having multiple development vulnerabilities is far worse. Research has indicated that close to 60 per cent of the children in the Northern Territory emergency response zone—that is, the remote communities and the town camps—have multiple developmental vulnerabilities as they enter the school system. So 60 per cent are significantly behind the eight ball before they enter the school system. If we look at the NAPLAN results and the attendance results—and this is all to do with it—we understand why they find it so very hard to complete an education or, in many cases, as we have seen up to year 5, attempt to start one.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">It is a lot harder to identify and access these children who we need to make a concerted effort to help because they are in these remote communities. Developmental vulnerabilities are significant but there are a lot of other significant issues that contribute to the disadvantage and disconnect experienced by Indigenous Australians. One of those is the exposure to alcohol abuse and general violence. Dr Bath stated, 'One of the hazards facing children that receives less attention because it is somewhat hard to measure and difficult to talk about publicly is the impact of the exposure of children to chronic family and community violence.' You will remember that I spoke a little earlier, Mr Acting Deputy President Back, about the multiple presentation of dysfunctionality and the association with feeling safe. When we look at this, I think one of the most important areas of vulnerability is the exposure to general abuse and violence not only of the children but of the whole family. Just as a statistic, most night patrols that were funded as part of the Northern Territory emergency response are the first response to individual and community violence. In 2010 the patrols responded—and this is for a target population of 29,000 adults, and for violent episodes—to 100,000 incidents. Recent Australian Institute of Health and Welfare data indicate that Indigenous people in the Northern Territory are hospitalised for assault at twice the rate of Indigenous people in other parts of Australia. Of particular concern is the vulnerability of women and children. Indigenous women are hospitalised for assault at an alarming rate, 69 times that of other women in the Northern Territory. Around 2.5 per cent of all Indigenous women in the Northern Territory are hospitalised for assault each year. We can make some comparisons. For example, in New South Wales there are 2½ times more Indigenous people than there are in the Northern Territory. In the two-year period to 2008, the Australian Institute of Health and Welfare records that 635 Indigenous women were hospitalised for assault in New South Wales. For the same period, for half the number of people, in the Northern Territory 1,729 women were hospitalised. In many of these violent incidents, children are present, witnessing, experiencing and absorbing the impact of this violence. I welcome the <span style="font-style:italic;">Closing the gap</span> report, but as I have indicated the document is more noteworthy for what it does not say than for what it does.</span>

                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Senator SIEWERT</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Western Australia</span>—<span class="HPS-MinisterialTitles">Australian Greens Whip</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">16:53</span>):  I also rise to take note of the <span style="font-style:italic;">Closing the Gap statement</span>. I note once again that this report was not tabled on the first day of parliament, as was originally promised. While I am pleased that the report has been tabled and has been issued, I think that, by failing to table it on the first day that parliament sits every year, what we are doing is failing to really mark that important date and say, 'We are totally committed to closing the gap.' We have missed that date every single time, so we have missed that opportunity to say, 'We are putting everything into closing the gap.'</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I, like Senator Scullion, was on the trip to the Northern Territory last week as part of an inquiry into the Stronger Futures legislation. I know that we will have some time to debate that legislation in this place in the coming weeks—far too soon, I might add, because it is obviously a series of bills that make up a piece of legislation that has very many significant holes in it which have become apparent already. One of the key things that were highlighted in the trip to the Northern Territory—along with those appalling statistics that Senator Scullion just referred to and that I will refer to in a minute—was the overwhelming rejection of the inter­vention; overwhelming rejection of the Stronger Futures process and a very clear understanding that it was phase 2 of the intervention; and overwhelming condem­nation of the lack of adequate consultation throughout the process of the intervention but also in the development of the Stronger Futures legislation. Almost to a person—there was one gentleman who did think the consultation was okay—the consultation process was condemned. In other words, once again this government is taking a top-down, paternalistic approach of, 'We know what's best for you,' and selectively listening.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Last week highlighted very starkly the fact that the intervention just has not delivered. The <span style="font-style:italic;">Closing the gap</span> report does highlight some improvements: how can we not acknowledge that it is a good thing that infant mortality rates have improved? But the gap is still enormous in many, many areas and it just has not been dealt with by the intervention. We are still seeing very significant problems with alcohol. While some people will say alcohol has improved, on one occasion some ladies came up to me and said, 'Although some of the men think alcohol's improved, it hasn't. We still have very, very significant problems.' The same is evident in other areas. While some of the legislation that the Northern Territory government have put in place most recently, in the middle of last year, started tightening up some of the alcohol controls, and they are going to be supplying us with some statistics to look at what they think is some decrease in hospitalisation due to violent incidents related to alcohol, we are still seeing enormous trauma caused by alcohol. In other words, the approach that the government has taken has failed to work. Income management has failed to work. This top-down, punitive approach, unless you engage with communities, does not work.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The issue of education is again highlighted in the <span style="font-style:italic;">Closing the gap</span> report. There is overemphasis on NAPLAN reports. Senator Scullion was just referring to statistics about the need for special assistance for children as they go into school. Sixty per cent of the children in those prescribed areas need some sort of special assistance, but they are not getting it. I have lost count of the number of times I have stood in this chamber and spoken about just one of the issues that children need special assistance for—hearing or literacy and numeracy programs. Those sorts of programs are absolutely essential. Unless we start dealing with these programs, I and people coming after me are going to be marking this day and saying, 'We still haven't closed the gap.' When we actually start putting resources into those critical areas, that is when we are going to see the gap starting to close and when we are actually able to develop a positive relationship between children and school so that children realise there is a meaningful reason to go to school—that is, you can get educational outcomes and there may be job prospects at the end of that process. We still do not have jobs being generated in the Northern Territory for people that have been promised and promised and promised. They have not delivered.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We keep seeing short-term decision making. With CDEP, the Howard government announced it was getting rid of it and started getting rid of it. The Labor government came in, put it back for a while and took it away again, and guess what: they have put it back again. They have realised that getting rid of CDEP this July is a massive policy blunder and they have temporarily put a freeze on the transition to killing off CDEP. And what have they done? It is indefinite. So once again we have this indefinite policy process going on in the NT around employment. No-one knows when the next step is going to be taken in this flawed policy approach. Again, with Stronger Futures, we have a series of more flawed approaches: 'Let's extend the SEAM program. Let's penalise parents if they don't send their kids to school. Let's alienate those parents from the education system.' All the research shows that what we need to be doing is engaging parents with the education system, encouraging participation in developing school programs and ensuring that we can have bilingual and culturally appropriate education where parents get a say and where students get something meaningful out of the experience of having their special assistance requirements met. I cannot say to you how many people have expressed the desire to want to engage with school, to want to engage in a better education for their kids and to see something meaningful. When you go back to the <span style="font-style:italic;">Closing the gap</span><span style="font-style:italic;"></span>report, what you see is a whole lot of, 'We've done this and we've done that.' We are getting slightly better results from NAPLAN, but we cannot clearly demonstrate that we are getting satisfactory educational outcomes from sending our kids to school. The process is: 'Let's get the kids into school and the education will take care of itself.' Well, it does not do that. What makes a good education? Engagement with the parents and with the schools, and with a curriculum that is culturally appropriate and actually meets children's needs. Making sure we have the right student-teacher ratio is absolutely critical, as is having quality teachers and quality principals. Those are the keys for delivering good educational outcomes, and we are just not seeing that. The government have tabled this <span style="font-style:italic;">Closing the gap</span> report, and they have tabled the Stronger Futures legislation, but there has been no mention of additional resources.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">When we were in the Northern Territory last week we heard about some of the good things that have come out of the intervention—there are a couple. Police in the community, everyone acknowledges, is a better thing, but resources have been absolutely critical. Putting resources into primary health has been absolutely essential, as is putting resources into helping community organisations address justice issues. One of the other 'benefits' of the intervention has been the skyrocketing incarceration rate of Aboriginal people in the Northern Territory. That is a great outcome, isn't it? Not! One of the benefits of the intervention, fortunately, has also been putting resources into addressing justice issues and enabling Aboriginal people to get access to community justice services.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">That funding runs out in June. The government has made no commitment of resources. We do not know if those very critical health services are going to continue. We do not whether those critical justice services are going to continue. The government have announced an expansion of the income management process both in the NT and in the other states. We do not know whether there are more resources there to cope with that. And, with the same program, the government said that they will commit some social workers, but we have no idea if that very substantial change in education in the Northern Territory is actually going to get additional funding from the federal government.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">In a couple of weeks we in this place will be asked to vote on legislation that goes for 10 years. That will expand the intervention, which will have been in place for 15 years. We are being asked to vote on that legislation, but we do not know if there is going to be any money to implement it. We do not know how much more money is going to be invested in closing the gap. The shadow report that the Aboriginal organisations tabled on the day of the <span style="font-style:italic;">Closing the gap</span> report highlights that as a critical need. It highlights the absolute essential need for the government to commit to resources, to all those health programs that are about to run out in June. It is essential if we are going again to close the gap that we no longer have this stop-start process of funding programs and of people being on short funding cycles. <span style="font-style:italic;">(Time expired)</span></span>

                <span class="HPS-Small">1. The Senate referred the inquiry into the administration and purchasing of Disability Employment Services in Australia (the Inquiry) to the Senate Standing References Committee on Education, Employment and Workplace Relations (the Committee) on 22 August 2011.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Small">2. The Committee report, The administration and purchasing of Disability Employment Services in Australia (the Report) was tabled on 25 November 2011.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Small">3. The Committee majority made 11 recommendations regarding purchasing arrangements for the Disability Employment Services—Employment Support Services (DES-ESS) for 2013-2015.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Small">4. Through submissions and hearings the Inquiry was able to document a range of views about a number of issues. There were some clear and divided opinions reflecting different interests in this area.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Small">5. A number of DES employment service providers and their peak bodies expressed a preference not to have to go through a tender process at all or are seeking to limit the number of providers required to do so.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Small">6. Other employment service providers that have been largely or entirely excluded from delivery under DES, and their peak employment service bodies, on the whole supported the decision to go to tender.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Small">7. It is the view of the Australian Government that the interests of people with disability should be paramount in determining these matters. The Australian Federation of Disability Organisations and other disability consumer organisations such as MS Australia and the National Council on Intellectual Disability provided submissions supportive of the DES-ESS tender decision based on the interests of people with disability.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Small">8. In addition the Department for Education Employment and Workplace Relations (the Department) put the view that the DES-ESS tender decision serves the public interest, as well as those of people with disability and employers.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Small">9. In designing the new DES programs, it is relevant to note that there were extensive consultations, beginning in 2008. Furthermore, there were consultations undertaken in advance of the 2011-12 Budget decisions on DES procurement. Evidence contained within the Report largely reflected the positions known through those earlier consultative processes.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Small">10. The Government recognises that the Committee has sought to strike compromises between competing service provider interests. However, in doing so it has given insufficient weight to the public interest and the interests of people with disability.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Small">11. A competitive tender process primarily based on performance is the most promising mechanism for:</span>

                  <span style="font-style:italic;" />
                  <span style="font-style:italic;">The committee recommends that the Department consider exploring alternative purchasing models for DES-ESS, especially in relation to the purchasing of specialist provider services.</span>
                </span>
              </p>

                <span class="HPS-Small">Not Supported.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Small">The Government believes that people with disability and their employers deserve access to the best possible employment services. A competitive open tender is a tried and proven mechanism that has proven to give fair and balanced outcomes. A tender will result in the contracting of the best possible employment services so more people with disability in more places in Australia benefit. After this tender, the public will be able to have confidence that the best possible providers are delivering these services.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Small">The Government acknowledges that competitive tender processes can involve some disruption to the market for participants and for employers. However, contracting the best providers will more than compensate for any short-term disruption that may occur during the transition and will deliver better outcomes for people with disability. Depending on the individual management of organisations, tendering can result in a temporary slow-down in performance over the tender period. However, there is evidence that the outcomes of a competitive tender have a positive effect on efficiency and the delivery of quality services to job seekers. For example, research by the Productivity Commission into the previous Job Network program showed that competition between providers and the use of outcome payments created strong incentives for providers to improve efficiency and find better ways of achieving job outcomes for job seekers.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Small">The Government will work closely with providers and stakeholders to put in place a transition plan that minimises disruption for participants and employers. Services and support will continue. Where job seekers move to a new provider, services are likely to improve with providers that have demonstrated their performance through the tender process.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Small">The Department has successfully managed changes in DES providers and the transition of job seekers on numerous occasions as part of regular business. In addition to the role of the Government and Department, providers have a role in providing clear and accurate information to job seekers or their families during any transitioning of the job seeker to another provider.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Small">It is also acknowledged that there may be organisations within the industry, both providers currently delivering DES-ESS and other potential tenderers, that have limited experience in preparing and submitting a response to a tender for employment services. The Government will, therefore, be taking steps to ensure that organisations are as well-prepared as possible for the DES-ESS tender by developing a range of communication products to support the tender process.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Small">Finally, the current arrangements in relation to both business share and direct registration of eligible job seekers provide flexibility in the way the system currently works to cater for some organisations to deliver services based on a very small business share.</span>

                  <span style="font-style:italic;" />
                  <span style="font-style:italic;">The committee recommends that any purchasing process for DES-ESS, including competitive tendering, be delayed by a further 12 months to avoid unnecessarily disrupting service provision during a time of improving performance.</span>
                </span>
              </p>

              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Small">Unlike DES – Disability Management Service (DES-DMS) and Job Services Australia (JSA) providers, DES-ESS providers were not required to demonstrate their capacity to deliver services through a competitive tender when the program was established. Existing providers of the program DES-ESS replaced were instead offered contracts, irrespective of performance.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Small">As such, there was no opportunity in 2009 for new providers to enter the DES-ESS market. There was also no opportunity for existing providers to compete for additional DES-ESS business. At the time, the Government signalled its intention to run a competitive tender process for DES-ESS in the future. This decision was also taken in the context of significant stability for many providers that have received recurrent funding without being required to tender – in some cases, for many years.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Small">Contract extensions are being offered to all DES-ESS providers until 3 March 2013 to allow providers a full two years to engage with the DES-ESS model prior to the collection of performance data to determine the tender. This will also extend the term of the current DES-ESS contract to three years in total. Furthermore, a longer than usual transition period has been allocated to support a sensitive and effective handover of participants and their employers.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Small">The Government notes the concerns raised in the Committee's Report about the timing of the DES-ESS tender given that the Government is simultaneously implementing reforms to the Disability Support Pension (DSP). These measures are designed to increase the workforce participation of people on the DSP and will have limited impact on DES providers and no impact on the tendering process.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Small">As the Department indicated in its submission to the Inquiry:</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Small">
                  <span style="font-style:italic;" />
                  <span style="font-style:italic;">"the flexibility of the employment services model enables major government reforms to be incorporated. DES providers will be expected to deliver employment services and record information as per the current Deed and guidelines. Providers will not be involved in the assessment process nor be expected to develop specific reports for the DSP Assessor."</span>
                </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Small">The concerns expressed by some providers that the changes will mean an increase in less motivated job seekers onto their caseload are overstated. The estimated additional 10,000 job seekers per year flowing into DES in 2011-12 and 2012-13 have similar characteristics to job seekers currently being assisted by DES providers and the increase will also occur across all providers and their sites over an extended period of time.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Small">The Government shares the views of the broader employment service and disability consumer sectors that the awarding of contracts should be primarily based on performance as assessed through a competitive tender process. The Government also recognises some merit in five year contracts in which the additional certainty could assist in establishing and growing a business; offering greater security to staff and stakeholders; and building relationships with employers, other local service providers and the community.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Small">Five year contract periods do, however, present some risks. Foremost is the need to ensure that expenditure of Commonwealth funds is efficient, effective, economical and ethical, and represents value for money to the Commonwealth. To do this, there would need to be flexibility built into a longer contract to accommodate change without the need for a renegotiation, for example to cater for changes in economic conditions. Furthermore, there is a need to ensure continual levels of high performance over a five year period. Some of these issues would be addressed through a mid-term business reallocation process.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Small">Employment services contracts are generally for periods of three years with provision for extensions. However, in practice, DEEWR has exercised this extension provision for most contracts, effectively making the contract periods much longer. As has been noted in the Department's submission, many current DES-ESS providers have been contracted for many years without the need to tender.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Small">Under the current purchasing arrangements the Deeds of DES-DMS providers, who were subject to a tender process in 2009, will be extended by an additional three years, taking the entire period to five years and four months. For the first time, organisations that are not delivering sustainable jobs for participants will be subject to a business reallocation process during the DES-DMS contract extension period.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Small">The Inquiry was presented with considerable evidence that a competitive tender process primarily based on performance will contribute to an improvement in service provision to people with disability.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Small">Through the DES-ESS tender process, the Government will test whether there are other organisations able to deliver higher levels of servicing to job seekers than providers currently performing at average or low levels.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Small">Setting the benchmark high for DES-ESS underscores the Government's commitment to quality services for people with disability, and means that job seekers, employers and the community at large can be confident that the best possible providers are delivering those services. It is simply not good enough to assume that average, or three-star performance, in a never-contested market represents quality service for people with disability.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Small">Attempts to draw parallels between the DES-ESS tender arrangements and the arrangements for JSA (that is, the offer of contract extensions to JSA providers rated three stars and above), are unfounded. JSA was established in 2009 after a full, open tender process to test the market and this was a key consideration in designing the current JSA procurement arrangements. By contrast, all DES-ESS providers were offered contract rollovers, irrespective of performance.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Small">However, rather than replicate the JSA arrangements and have a full tender for DES-ESS, the Government has decided to reward high performing providers with a contract extension. This will ensure some stability for people who are currently receiving services from high performing providers.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Small">Quality plays an important role in the DES Performance Framework. Since 1 January 2002 organisations delivering disability employment programs have been required to be certified as meeting the Disability Services Standards in order to receive funding from the Australian Government. This certification is undertaken by auditors that are independent of the Government.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Small">The Government's view is that these arrangements are already in place. The Department already uses a comprehensive range of monitoring and detection strategies to identify activities and practices that impact on the integrity of employment programs. These strategies cover a broad spectrum of activities from centralised data monitoring to site visits and discussions with providers and more detailed feedback from program participants or other third parties through program assurance and customer service lines.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Small">Through its governance arrangements and program monitoring the Department is confident that the vast majority of providers comply with the spirit, intent and letter of their Deed with the Department, the Disability Services Standards and associated requirements for professional service provision to support people with disability.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Small">The Department also has comprehensive and long-standing program governance arrangements which ensure the ongoing quality and accountability of all its employment services programs. This approach meets Commonwealth Government requirements and is reviewed regularly, to ensure its currency and effectiveness. Employment services programs undergo regular audits (both internal and external via the ANAO). The Department also regularly updates its processes in response to these activities and any recommendations by the ANAO.</span>

Non-payable outcomes and non-payable job placements are already defined in the existing DES Deed, which comprehensively detail when an outcome cannot be claimed. The contractual definitions of these outcomes will be strengthened in the DES Deed 2012 – 2015 to further support the management of inappropriate practices. However, some practices which may be termed 'scheming' or 'sharp practices' are more difficult to categorically rule as inappropriate. In determining if a practice is (or could potentially be) in breach of the Deed or in other ways inappropriate, the relevant policy intention, the specific circumstances of the job seeker in question and the broader situation must be taken into account.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Small">The Therapeutic Group Premium (TGP) pricing policy has been in place for 13 years and represents an extension of the evidence-based assessment of cost-effectiveness that is required by legislation for subsidy on the Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme (PBS). It ensures that the Government does not pay extra unless there is evidence of extra benefit.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Small">As of the August 2011 <span style="font-style:italic;">Schedule of Pharmaceutical Benefits</span> there are only seven drug products that attract a therapeutic group premium (five for hypertension and two for ulcers) out of over 3,900 on the PBS. In the therapeutic areas of cardiology and gastroenterology where medicines with therapeutic group premiums exist, there are multiple alternatives with no premium and options for exemption for those patients who cannot take another drug on clinical grounds.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Small">The Senate committee acknowledged the work undertaken by the Government to educate and inform consumers and prescribers at the time the therapeutic group policy was introduced and these approaches are detailed in the report. Important elements of this education campaign still operate to explain the therapeutic groups currently available, together with the alternatives and the process for seeking exemptions from a therapeutic group premium on behalf of a patient. The community pharmacy network is an important source of information on PBS medicines with either a brand or a therapeutic group premium while the PBS information line (1800 020 613) is also available to assist consumers in this area.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Small">Health consumers have a unique and important perspective on health services as the users and beneficiaries of health care and ultimately those who pay for it. The Government is currently looking at new ways to enhance the consumer input in PBAC matters, such as:</span>

This conference, organised every two years, is pivotal in facilitating discussion on the varying perspectives on how public subsidy of medicines operates in Australia, with a particular emphasis on the assessment of medicines through the PBAC; and</span>

              <p class="HPS-SmallBullet" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-SmallBullet">in-depth consultation with the Consumers Health Forum to redesign the public comments pages on the Department’s web-site to facilitate more meaningful consumer input to PBAC agenda items, which are available to the Committee during its considerations.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Small">Both the Government and the PBAC have a long history of improving such input from patients and from the general community. The PBAC has a consumer representative as a full member of the committee; comments are sought from the general public on subsidy applications on the PBAC agenda and these are provided to the PBAC when the submissions are considered; and the PBAC may request a formal consumer impact statement from the Consumers Health Forum when considering the impact of a health condition and the possible improvement in the quality of life for people using the proposed treatment.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Small">Although no new therapeutic groups will be created over the period of the MoU except in specific and limited circumstances, the Government in the development of any future therapeutic groups will endeavour to engage consumers in meaningful consultation, as appropriate within the Budget context. Therapeutic groups remain a valuable pricing policy to reduce costs to the PBS. The policy reflects a 13 year long view of successive governments that PBS patients and taxpayers should pay comparable prices for similar health outcomes.</span>

Information about therapeutic groups is available on the Department of Health and Ageing’s website at www.pbs.gov.au/browse/therapeutic-group; while information about PBAC recom­mendations, in the form of public summary docu­ments, are available at http://www.health.gov.au/internet/main/publishing.nsf/Content/public-summary-documents-by-product</span>

This matter was brought by AstraZeneca against the Minister of Health and Ageing and members of the PBAC. The hearing on this matter was held in Sydney before Justice Buchanan on Friday 25 March.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Small">In his decision, delivered on 12 May 2011, Justice Buchanan found that the PBAC had performed its functions in accordance with the Act, in providing advice that atorvastatin and rosuvastatin should be treated as interchangeable on an individual patient basis. His Honour found that neither the PBAC, nor the Minister, are required to consider the individual dosages of the medicine when assessing interchangeability for the purposes of forming therapeutic groups under the Act. This means the Statins-HP therapeutic group was validly constituted and savings from the creation of the therapeutic group will continue.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Small">This court decision has confirmed the Government’s position that consideration of interchangeability at the drug level, and not at the form and strength level, is consistent with the Act.

              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Small">There was some concern expressed during the inquiry that not all doctors may be aware that they are able to seek an exemption from a therapeutic group premium on behalf of their patients.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Small">However the number of drug products on the PBS with a therapeutic group premium, and hence the option to apply for an exemption for an individual patient, is very low. As of the August 2011 Schedule of Pharmaceutical Benefits, therapeutic group premiums apply to only 7 out of over 3,900 drug products and are in the field of gastrointestinal medicine and cardiology. Some prescribers outside of these fields may be unfamiliar with the process for seeking exemption to a TGP, however we do not consider the concerns expressed by the clinicians appearing before the committee are representative of clinicians working in those fields where Therapeutic Group Premium (TGP) drugs are prescribed.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Small">All prescribers have ongoing access through the Schedule of Pharmaceutical Benefits and their computer dispensing software to the specified clinical criteria by which they may apply for exemption from a therapeutic group premium for their patient. The process by which this happens is the same one prescribers already use to apply for approval from Medicare Australia to prescribe certain restricted drugs on the PBS. The Schedule of Pharmaceutical Benefits, in both in hard-copy and web-based versions, also contains a separate, regularly updated TGP policy section featuring the PBS items that still attract a therapeutic group premium and the process whereby individual patient exemptions may be sought. The Government will continue to use these mechanisms to ensure prescribers are informed about TGPs.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">On behalf of the Joint Standing Committee on Foreign Affairs, Defence and Trade I have pleasure in presenting the committee's report entitled <span style="font-style:italic;">Review of the Defence annual report 2009-10</span>. The review of the Defence annual report is an important task, and an opportunity for the Defence subcommittee of the Joint Standing Committee on Foreign Affairs, Defence and Trade to inquire into a broad range of Defence issues as part of the process of accountability of government agencies to parliament. The subcommittee takes this responsibility very seriously.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The subcommittee took evidence from senior Department of Defence officials at a public hearing held in Canberra on 25 March 2011. The subcommittee selected a broad range of issues for examination at the public hearing. In broad terms, the focus areas were: the Strategic Reform Program; person­nel including the People in Defence Strategy, ADF pay remediation and ADF mental health reforms; justice and security, includ­ing military justice, security of vital national assets in the North-West of Aust­ralia, Border Protection Command and ADF base security; and, the Defence Materiel Organisation, including reform and procure­ment, projects of concern and specific projects.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Due to the size and complexity of the defence department, the committee secretariat offered to assist Defence in its preparation for the public hearing on 25 March 2011. Unfortunately, other than the secretary, the Chief of the Defence Force and those officers representing DMO, Defence officials seemed somewhat poorly briefed. This lack of preparedness was compounded by the delay in the provision of answers to questions taken on notice.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Answers to questions on notice were provided some five months after the hearing. The committee therefore recommends that the Department of Defence review its practices and procedures to ensure that answers to the committee's questions on notice are provided in a more timely manner</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Documentation and hard evidence of the outcomes of the Strategic Reform Program were hard for the committee to find. There is a difficulty, in an organisation as big as Defence of tracking savings. The committee, therefore, spent much of its questioning of Defence on the idea of a 'cost-conscious culture.'</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The committee acknowledge the difficulty in any organisation creating cultural change; however, the committee is concerned that Defence will not be able to institute the cost-conscious culture necessary not only for the SRP but for the Defence organisation long past 2030; the SRP relies more on cultural change than rigorously costed savings plans.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The committee looked into base security and is concerned that, at the time of its public hearing, some 20 months after the threats to Holsworthy Barracks, the defence department is slowly moving towards decreasing the threat level of its bases.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">In relation to the Defence Materiel Organisation, whilst heartened by the establishment of the Independent Project Performance Office the committee is concerned that this not become another level of bureaucracy that hinders rather than helps the performance of DMO.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Lastly, I wish to make a comment on the Joint Strike Fighter. At the time of writing the committee had three main concerns regarding the JSF: cost; schedule; and capability. This is an issue that the committee will be pursuing in its review of the Defence Annual Report 2010-11 at the inquiry next month that is currently underway. I commend the report to the Senate.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Small">This Government has a proud history of reforms that facilitate access to justice.  This Bill marks the latest tranche of those reforms.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Small">The Bill will implement legislative reforms regarding discovery during Federal Court litigation that were recommended in the Australian Law Reform Commission’s Managing Discovery report, tabled in Parliament in May 2011.  </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">The Attorney-General initiated that Inquiry in May 2010, following the 2009 report by the Attorney-General’s Department’s Access to Justice Taskforce, A Strategic Framework for Access to Justice in the Federal Civil Justice System.  The Taskforce identified the high and sometimes disproportionate costs of discovery as a specific barrier to justice.  </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">The ALRC made practical recommendations aimed at the Federal Court taking greater control over the discovery process, many of which have already been implemented by the Court in its new Rules, or are under active consideration by the Court.  I acknowledge the effort the Federal Court continues to put into refining its case management processes, including those relating to discovery.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">The Government also welcomes current consideration by the Federal Court and National Judicial College of Australia of how judicial education and training can better equip judges to manage the discovery process.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">The two recommendations to be implemented by this Bill will give the Federal Court stronger powers to deal with the costs of discovery, and clarify that oral examinations can be used to assist to identify which kinds of documents should be subject to discovery. This will support judges in their role as robust case managers.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">I am confident that this package of reforms will give the Federal Court the tools it needs to control discovery more tightly, assisting in the delivery of a more accessible and effective system of civil justice.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Small">The Bill will also implement – with some minor variations – the model legislation developed by the then Standing Committee of Attorneys-General on suppression and </span>

                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">non-publication orders in the High Court, Federal Court, Family Court and Federal Magistrates Court.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">There has been criticism of the volume and breadth of suppression orders granted by some State courts.  As a result of these concerns, after extensive consultation, in 2010, the Standing Committee of Attorneys-General developed model legislation on suppression orders.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">This Bill will implement that model law in relation to the federal courts – in the interests of national consistency and to provide a more robust and comprehensive legislative framework. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">The Bill has several advantages over the current arrangements for the making of suppression orders in the federal courts:</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-SmallBullet" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-SmallBullet">It provides a clearer legislative framework for the grounds on which suppression orders can be made, what information they can cover, how long they should last for, how broad they should be and what information such orders should contain, as well as clearer rules about standing.  </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-SmallBullet" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-SmallBullet"> It clearly preserves the importance of the principle of open justice, and provides that suppression orders can only be made where such orders are necessary, consistent with recent High Court jurisprudence.  </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-SmallBullet" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-SmallBullet">The Bill does not include the provision in the SCAG model law that allows a court to grant a suppression order if it is necessary in the public interest for the order to be made. The Bill therefore does not broaden the grounds on which suppression orders can be made from those that currently apply. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">This Bill will provide a more transparent and accountable legislative regime for courts to make suppression orders.  By ensuring that courts can only make suppression orders when they are clearly justified – and in as narrow terms as necessary to achieve their purpose –the Bill appropriately recognises the fundamental importance that open justice plays in the administration of justice, and ultimately in upholding the rule of law.  </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">

                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">Vexatious litigants have the capacity to absorb an enormous amount of judicial and registry staff’s time, to the detriment of other litigants waiting to have their cases dealt with.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">It was for this reason the then Standing Committee of Attorneys-General developed a model law on vexatious proceedings.  This law has already been implemented in Queensland, New South Wales and the Northern Territory.  This Bill will implement the model law in the High Court, Federal Court, Family Court and Federal Magistrates Court.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">It is important to bear in mind that a self-represented litigant, or a litigant who has challenging behaviour (perhaps caused by mental illness), is very different from a vexatious litigant.  With advice and assistance, many self-represented litigants are often able to adequately formulate and articulate their claims, or to obtain legal representation to enable them to do so.  Those with challenging behaviours may be able to obtain professional assistance of another kind.  I want to emphasise that these are not the kinds of litigants intended to be addressed by this Bill.  </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">Rather, vexatious litigants are those who frequently bring proceedings that are, for example, an abuse of process, designed to annoy others, or have no reasonable grounds.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">Although the federal courts already have existing powers to deal with vexatious litigants, these powers are located across various legislation and court rules, and differ in detail.  The Bill will establish a more comprehensive and consistent legislative regime across all four federal courts. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">While an order preventing access to the courts should not be made lightly, where a person has frequently instituted or conducted vexatious proceedings in any Australian court or tribunal, a court will be able to make an order that a person not be able to commence any subsequent proceedings in that court without first obtaining the leave of the court.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">The intention is that, once nationally consistent laws are passed, a vexatious litigant will no longer be able to repeatedly initiate proceedings in different courts with hopelessly doomed litigation.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">It is essential that court resources are devoted to cases that have merit, and cases which cannot be resolved by other means.  The courts need appropriate powers to be able to deal with clearly unmeritorious cases brought by vexatious litigants.  This Bill will deliver that.</span>
                </p>

                  <span class="HPS-Small">The Bill will also remove the current jurisdictional ceiling on Family Law Magistrates in Western Australia that applies in family law property matters.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">This will bring Western Australia’s Family Law Magistrates into line with the family law property jurisdiction which can be exercised by the Federal Magistrates Court in the rest of Australia, and give the Family Court of Western Australia more flexibility in the allocation of cases.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Small">The Government re-introduced this Bill because we want to make the private health insurance rebate fairer and more sustainable into the future. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">The Government supports a mixed model of balanced private and public health services. We are committed to a sustainable private health system, and to ensure it remains sustainable the Government will rebalance support for private health insurance to provide a fairer distribution of benefits. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">Let me emphasise one point that has been missing in much of the debate about these changes.  The vast majority of taxpayers with private health insurance will not be affected by the means testing this legislation introduces.  Singles earning $83,000 or less and couples and families earning $166,000 or less will receive the same rebate as they currently enjoy.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">In fact, the Government’s changes will ensure that these taxpayers receive a greater share of the private health insurance rebate than they currently get.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">Under the rebate model we inherited from the Howard Government, approximately 14 per cent of single taxpayers who have incomes above $83,000 receive about 28 per cent of the total private health insurance rebate paid to singles based on an average premium—or twice their population share.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">And approximately 12 per cent of couple taxpayers who have incomes above $166,000 receive about 21 per cent of the total private health insurance rebate paid to couples based on an average premium—again, almost twice their population share.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">So when the Opposition was in Government it designed a system that favoured wealthier income earners.  That is people like myself and the Opposition Spokesperson on Health – not the cleaners and security guards who work in this building.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">How does the Leader of the Opposition reconcile his track record on this issue when he was Health Minister with the crocodile tears he was crying for the ‘forgotten families’ in his Budget reply?</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">Under our reforms, the 14 percent of single taxpayers earning more than $83,000 with private health insurance will receive about 12 per cent of the total private health insurance rebate paid to singles based on an average premium. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">Similarly, the 12 per cent of couple taxpayers earning more than $166,000 will receive around 9 per cent of the total private health insurance rebate paid to couples based on an average premium.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">Far from being an attack on families as some have alleged, this Bill reinforces an important principle that has underpinned the Australian tax-transfer system for decades - that the greatest share of benefits are provided to those on lower incomes. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">There is a second crucial principle at stake here – the need to ensure our health system is placed on a sustainable footing for the future.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">Spending on the private health insurance rebate is growing rapidly and is expected to double as a proportion of health expenditure within the next 40 years. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">Clearly this presents challenges in the current fiscal environment. It is estimated that these reforms will result in savings to Government expenditure of around $2.4 billion across the forward estimates. This will help ensure that the Government’s support for private health insurance remains fair and sustainable. </span>

                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">The Opposition’s previous refusal to support this legislation has already hit the 2010-11 Budget bottom-line by $890 million.  If we don’t act now the fiscal consequences will only worsen.  Treasury estimates that not passing this legislation will have a cumulative impact on health spending of around $100 billion over 40 years.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">No-one professing an interest in good fiscal management can ignore these statistics.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">The Opposition has also said on the record that if they oppose savings measures they will identify where these savings can be found in the Budget.  On 22 June, Kevin Andrews said in the House of Representatives “if we are going to oppose measures which the Government puts forward and that opposition will lead to a cost to the budget, we will identify where the savings are going to be made in the budget in order to compensate for that loss to the budget.”  </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">I challenge the Opposition to find an area in the Health portfolio where an equivalent saving of $2.4 billion can be found, that will not have a noticeable impact on health outcomes as is the case with means testing the private health insurance rebate.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">So the Government will act.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">From 1 July 2012, the Government proposes to introduce three new private health insurance incentive tiers. The tiers will mean high-income earners receive lower Government payments for private health insurance but will face an increase in costs if they opt out of private health cover. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">The Government’s commitment to retaining the private health insurance rebate remains. Rebates for low and middle income earners will be unchanged, with the Government continuing to pay 30 per cent of the premium cost for a person earning $83,000 or less and couples and families earning $166,000 or less. The existing rebates for older Australians will remain in place for people earning below these thresholds—35 per cent for people aged 65 to 69 years and 40 per cent for people aged 70 years and over. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">These people will continue to have no surcharge liability if they decide not to take out appropriate private health insurance. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">The new tiered system will be introduced for higher income earners and will set three different rebate levels and surcharge levels based on income and age. The purpose of this is to reduce the carrot but increase the stick and ensure those who can afford to contribute more for their health insurance do so. The Government does not believe it is appropriate for low-income earners to subsidise the private health insurance costs of high-income earners. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">Tier 1 will apply to singles with an income of more than $83,000 and couples and families with an income of more than $166,000. For these people the private health insurance rebate will be 20 per cent for those up to 65 years, 25 per cent for those aged 65 to 69, and 30 per cent for those aged 70 and over. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">The Medicare levy surcharge for people in this tier who do not hold appropriate private health insurance will remain at one per cent. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">Tier 2 applies to singles earning more than $96,000 a year and couples and families earning more than $192,000. The rebate will be 10 per cent for those up to 65 years, 15 per cent for those aged 65 to 69, and 20 per cent for those aged 70 and over. The surcharge for people in this tier who do not have appropriate private health insurance will be increased to 1.25 per cent of income. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">Tier 3 affects singles earning more than $129,000 a year and couples and families earning more than $258,000 a year. No private health insurance rebate will be provided for people who fall within the third tier and the surcharge for avoiding private health insurance will be increased to 1.5 per cent of income for these people. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">Annual indexation to average weekly earnings of the tiers income thresholds will ensure that these changes remain equitable and can be maintained into the future. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">There has been some hysterical claims made in recent times about the effects of these changes.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">None more so than the claim in a Private Healthcare Australia (then the Australian Health Insurance Association) Report that 1.6 million people would abandon private health cover if the Government introduced a means test for the rebate.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">I won’t waste any time pointing out the flaws in this Report, but I would draw the attention of the Senate to the statement about the impact of the rebate changes issued to the Australian Stock Exchange by the private health insurer nib on 4 May 2011 which said, and I quote:</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">“our analysis indicates any impact would be moderate, which is in line with previous Treasury estimates which … rely upon the countervailing influence of the Medicare Levy Surcharge and proposed increases.”</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">As the nib statement points out, the Government is retaining a system of carrots and sticks that will minimise the impact of the proposed changes.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">The increased Medicare levy surcharge for people on higher incomes will help ensure that about 99.7 per cent of insured people remain in private health insurance. This is because those high-income earners who receive a lower rebate will face a higher tax penalty for avoiding private health insurance.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">It is estimated that approximately 27,000 people may no longer be covered by private health insurance hospital cover and this might result in 8,600 additional public hospital admissions over two years. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">When considered against the fact that public hospitals have around 4.7 million admissions per year, the impact of this measure will be insignificant. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">The Ipsos Syndicated Survey: Health Care &amp; Insurance - Australia 2011 was released in November 2011.   According to Ipsos approximately 40,000 would drop their private hospital insurance– provided that insurers inform their members about the impact of Lifetime Health Cover and the Medicare levy surcharge.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">In summary, this measure will make private health fairer, more balanced and more sustainable in the long term. By maintaining a carefully designed system of carrots and sticks, it will have a negligible effect on both private health insurance premiums and the public hospital system. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">At the same time, low and middle income earners who choose to have private health insurance will continue to enjoy the benefit of a significant Government rebate. </span>

Julia Gillard and other Labor members have, over many years, repeatedly ruled out any changes to the private health insurance rebates. They have been totally and utterly false about their positions.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">I take the Senate back, if I may, to the then shadow minister for health, Julia Gillard, on 2 September 2004:</span>

                <span class="HPS-Small">The truth is I never had a secret plan to scrap the private health insurance rebate and, contrary to Mr Latham's diaries, do not support such a claim. For all Australians who want to have private health insurance the private health insurance rebate would have remained under a Labor government. I gave an iron-clad guarantee of that during the election.</span>

Then we had Nicola Roxon on <span style="font-style:italic;">Meet the Press</span><span style="font-style:italic;">,</span> on 23 September 2007, saying, 'We are committed to the 30 per cent.' Then, when she was asked by Steve Lewis, 'So you won't wind back the 30 per cent private health rebate, despite the fact that Labor has been ideologically opposed to it in the past?' Nicola Roxon replied, 'No, we won't.' On 26 September 2007, the former Minister for Health and Ageing, Nicola Roxon, said:</span>

              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Small">The Liberals continue to try to scare people into thinking Labor will take away the rebates. This is absolutely untrue.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">Then we have the letter of 20 November 2007 from then Prime Minister Rudd to the Australian Health Insurance Association, reiterating this commitment in writing, but the letter was not even worth the paper it was written on. After that federal election, former Prime Minister Rudd said that the private health insurance rebate policy 'remains unchanged and will remain unchanged'. We kept getting these promises that Labor would retain the rebate.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">In a speech in October 2008, Nicola Roxon was again making this commitment, yet during Senate estimates it was revealed that, while Minister Roxon was giving that public assurance behind closed doors, she and other senior members of the government were seeking advice on how to progress changes to those private health insurance rebates. They were firmly committed to retaining the existing rebates in public, while secretly working on plans to reduce and scrap them. We know that Minister Roxon first obtained advice from her department on 12 January 2009, and the advice on how to change the rebate was being sought by the health minister's office as early as December 2008. Treasury provided advice on means testing the rebate on 20 February 2009 at the request of the Treasurer.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">This is the hallmark of the Rudd and Gillard governments. They say one thing and they do another. We know that these cuts will affect and further add to Labor's cost-of-living burden on working Australians. After years of waste and mismanagement, Labor is hiking up prices for working Australians. We know that Labor's premium hikes will force people to drop private health insurance and will downgrade their cover, and this will further stretch the overstretched public hospital system. Labor is wrong to imply that private health insurance is only for the rich—5.6 million people with private health insurance have an annual household income of less than $50,000 and 3.4 million have an annual household income of less than $35,000. Given this government's history, we are very concerned that, unless these bills are discharged from the <span style="font-style:italic;">Notice Paper</span>, the Australian public will be hit again. Consequently, I seek support for a suspension to enable this discharge motion. <span style="font-style:italic;">(Time expired)</span></span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Western Australia</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">17:23</span>):  The government's decision to abolish the private health insurance rebate for millions of Australians is just another example of the bad and ideologically driven policy we get from this very incompetent and deeply divided Labor government. This broken promise on the private health insurance rebate is bad policy, it is bad for our health system and it is bad for patients right across Australia. Before the 2007 election the coalition was somewhat suspicious about the Labor Party's intentions in relation to private health insurance. So we made the assertion that Labor in government would do what they have done before—that is, undermine those Australians who take additional responsibility for their own healthcare needs by taking out private health insurance, who are putting additional money into the health system and who received a tax incentive from the Howard government to encourage them to put more of their own resources into the health system. Of course, whenever we made the assertion that Labor would do as they have always done—that is, make people who take additional responsibility for their own healthcare needs pay the price for the government's reckless and wasteful spending in other areas—Labor put their hands on their hearts and said: 'We wouldn't do that. We're not going to touch the private health insurance rebate. We're committed to the private health insurance rebate.' This government, which is completely untrustworthy—this Labor administration which made promise after promise before the election only to break them after the election—is now trying to put through the Senate a piece of legislation which has previously been rejected by the Senate.</span>

                  </a>  As Senator Fierravanti-Wells has just reminded me, the Senate very sensibly rejected this bad legislation on two occasions. And why did the Senate reject Labor's attempts to make people who take additional responsibility for their own healthcare needs pay for Labor's own reckless and wasteful spending in other areas? Because the Senate knew that this piece of legislation will push up the cost of private health insurance, put it beyond the reach of a number of Australians and see more people leave private health insurance, which will push up the cost of health insurance for everyone, including low- and middle-income earners who are currently making significant sacrifices in order to be able to afford their private health insurance every year—the people who are most likely to leave private health insurance after the cost increases by 42 per cent immediately.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Courtesy of this decision, many Australians will have to pay 42 per cent more for their private health insurance just like that, without even taking any of the flow-on consequences into account. As those Australians who are least likely to need private health insurance in the foreseeable future leave private health insurance, the cost for all of the remaining Australians, including those who are most likely to need private health insurance in the foreseeable future, will go up. This will take us back to the vicious cycle where past Labor administrations have taken us before, where we see the cost of private health insurance go up and people leave, and then the cost goes up more and more people leave. Of course, we end up with a downward spiral of additional pressure on our public hospital system, with more people having to join public hospital queues, when quite frankly what the government should be doing is providing well-targeted incentives to encourage more people to take out private health insurance and put additional resources into the health system.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">All of the evidence that has been presented over the last 10 or so years since this very sensible and very successful Howard government policy was put in place has demonstrated that this has been part of a highly successful package of policy initiatives. It was of course the Howard government that reversed the decline in private health insurance when it came into government in 1996. The private health insurance rebate, lifetime health cover and the Medicare levy surcharge were a successful package of initiatives that helped restore the balance in our health system. We need both a strong public system and a strong private system so that all Australians can have timely and affordable access to high quality health care.</span>

We have heard this debate twice over now. They get up on procedural matters and suck up oxygen which could be used for the merit of the debate when we have the second reading debate and the committee stages of the bill. Rather than wait for that, they use a cheap political stunt such as a procedural motion to argue the point again. What we did not hear from those opposite is the actual argument for why Senator Fierravanti-Wells's motion should get up—not the merit of the actual debate. Senator Fierravanti-Wells and Senator Cormann can have their say, for 20 minutes a pop, during the second reading debate to argue their case and convince those here in this chamber. But we did not hear one jot about why we should up-end the Senate and pay attention to the false and pitiful motion that Senator Fierravanti-Wells has put up, which would ultimately stop the bill from proceeding. Forget about the fancy words that are put in front of it; it would stop the bill from proceeding. And what would we be doing? We would be denying reform by a Labor government committed to improving the lives of working people and creating greater fairness for them and their families. This legislation is a win-win for working families, and those opposite do not want to participate in it. I understand that. They have a different view. They have a very different view on this legislation. But this is not the time for that debate. They will all have an opportunity to debate that in due course.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">We are now having a debate on this motion, put up by Senator Fierravanti-Wells, that is simply a procedure device. They have used it before; they will do it again. As I said, they have not learnt from the last time. All you are doing is using procedural devices to try to change the course, to say that your particular motion should have precedence. This would effectively mean that your motion would take precedence in the Senate. There is no argument for that. There is no argument as to why your motion should take precedence. No specific issues were raised other than the same arguments that were raised in the lower house about the merits of the bill. It is quite appropriate. You can have your say when the second reading debate comes on. That is the place to say it, not here. If we start to add them up, it becomes very clear to me that you are simply into delay and Senate time-wasting opportunities.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">In recent years, it seems those opposite have been unable to contain themselves. They find procedural devices to give the debate some more currency—wake up to yourself. Use the force of the second reading debate to make your point in committee rather than try to use cheap political stunts such as this to rerun your argument. Alternatively, subscribe to the groundhog theory that you simply want to rerun the argument time and time again without recognising that what you are doing has little merit. In my view, it has no merit at all.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">Five bills have been introduced. This is the point where we introduce the bills for debate. It is usually non-controversial. We bring these bills in, we put them on the <span style="font-style:italic;">Notice Paper</span> and they are there for debate. Unfortunately those opposite seem unable to resist the temptation to use the time of the chamber for procedural shenanigans on the introduction of the Fairer Private Health Insurance Incentives Bill 2012 and related bills. Let us be clear: this debate is using up the time of the Senate for a cheap, political stunt on a procedural motion that cheapens the opposition's ability to argue during this second stage. Quite disappointingly, those opposite seem only prepared to rerun the arguments without— <span style="font-style:italic;">(Time expired)</span></span>

It is so that this legislation is not further considered and does not proceed through this chamber. That is the purpose. We have been denied leave to move the motion so we are now debating that standing orders be suspended to enable this particular debate. I hope that the chamber agrees for that to happen.</span>

                  </a>  I think the word 'fib' is well within the bounds of discourse in this place but thank you, Madam Acting Deputy President. I was saying that this is as clear-cut a case of breaking one's word, of fibbing, as was the broken carbon tax promise. At successful elections members of the Australian Labor Party—candidates, members and senators—put their hands on their hearts and said, 'We will not touch the private health insurance rebate.' I recall the member for Griffith saying, 'Not one jot; not one tittle.' I am not sure what that was but I took it to mean he was not going to change it in any way, shape or form. That is the commitment they made. They said: 'Trust us, we love private schools—no schools hit list.' They said, 'Trust us, we love private health insurance. We're not going to touch the private health insurance rebate, in any way—not even a means test.'</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">You know what? A lot of Australians at successive elections took them at their word. I know because I had members of the public come to me and say, 'Look, Labor don't want to attack private schools. Labor don't want to attack private health insurance. I have heard Labor senators and members say that.' That is what they say to me. I would explain, calmly and patiently, 'Don't believe them; they haven't changed.' It is clear that nothing has changed about the Australian Labor Party. Its traditions and its roots in class envy and envy politics go deep.</span>

We believe that if you do not take out private health insurance and you have the capacity to, above a certain income level there should be a penalty. We believe there should be that stick. But we also believe that there should be a carrot—encouragement and reward for making provision for yourself. This legislation seeks to attack that very idea of making provision for yourself when you have the capacity to do so.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">South Australia</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">17:39</span>):  I indicate that I will not be supporting this motion. I think it is important that I outline the reasons for doing so, so that it is not misinterpreted as in any way supporting the government's position, in a substantive sense, with respect to the legislation that is being put up.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Firstly, I do not think it is appropriate to use this vehicle of the suspension of standing orders in relation to a motion with respect to legislation that will be coming to the Senate shortly. The fact is the legislation has passed the House of Representatives. The fact is we will have ample opportunity to debate this. Provided there is not a gag motion applied there will be a fulsome debate on this piece of legislation. So my issue with Senator Fierravanti-Wells is not with the substance of what she is trying to achieve—that is, to highlight the inadequacies of this legislation—but I do not think it is appropriate for there to be a suspension of standing orders so that the bills are not debated at all.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I do have concerns about the government's bills. I will be opposing the government's bills for the same reason that I opposed them previously. I think that this legislation will have a number of unintended consequences. Those consequences will be that people will drop out of private health insurance. It will mean that more and more people will go to the public system. It will place an undue and unnecessary burden on the public system.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We need to bear in mind what the impact of that will be. It could mean a spiralling of increased premiums in the private health insurance system. It could mean a greater burden on the public purse in terms of the public system. I think it is worth reflecting on the work of the Productivity Commission. Some three years ago I negotiated with the government, in return for my support for changes to the Medicare surcharge thresholds, that a report be undertaken by the Productivity Commission into the different outcomes between the public and private systems. Something like that was never done before. I thought it was a very fair report. It was a robust report, as is generally the case from the Productivity Commission. That report, I think, is worth reflecting on in the context of the legislation that this motion refers to. I am worried that we will disturb the equilibrium between the public and private systems as a result of the government legislation that has already gone through the lower house.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I am worried that the government has not adequately modelled a whole range of issues in terms of the impact of this legislation, including the issue of people dropping out or downgrading their cover because, if that is the case, expect to see—with respect to physiotherapy, some help with dental work, occupational therapy and a whole range of ancillary covers—a massive shift to the public system. In order to avoid any levies and in order to avoid any penalties people will simply downgrade their cover to the absolute minimum. That, to me, will have all sorts of dire consequences to the private health system, with a significant flow-on effect to the public health system.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">These are matters that I think ought to be ventilated at the second reading stage. So I agree with Minister Ludwig in relation to this. That stage is the appropriate time to debate them. I certainly hope there will not be a gagging of debate either at the second reading or committee stages.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I do not quite understand that this motion to suspend standing orders is appropriate. I think we should subject this legislation to the robust scrutiny it deserves. I will be voting against the legislation but I am looking forward to the committee stages. For those reasons—those technical reasons, if you like—I cannot support what Senator Fierravanti-Wells is proposing. But I do share her deep concerns about the impact of this legislation.</span>

                  </a>  There is nothing wrong with stunts, Senator Xenophon. I think you got the prize today! But this is another stunt. If the motion were carried—let us be very clear about what this means—we would not allow the Senate to do what it is noted for, and that is to scrutinise legislation.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">The upshot of this being carried would be that we would not debate a series of bills that have been passed by the House of Representatives. We would not be able to do what the Senate is noted for—scrutinise, amend, negotiate, and work with the crossbenchers to get a better outcome for the Australian community. I believe that the bills represent very good policy—great policy—but there are people in this place who have a different opinion. And Senator Xenophon has said as much in his contribution. This is a procedural motion—a procedural motion that would mean, if it were carried, that we would not debate significant changes to the private health insurance levies system in our country. Let us go to why the Liberal Party does not want to have a fulsome debate about this particular set of bills. We know that this legislation will save taxpayers $2.4 billion over the next three years or $100 billion over the next 40 years. We also know that the opposition leader had said that, if he were to become prime minister, the proposal that Labor is putting forward would be repealed. That is another $2.4 billion that he has to find in the forward estimates. It is another $100 billion over the next 40 years if these changes to the private health insurance rebate are not carried.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">If we carry this motion we will not have the opportunity to refute the absolutely incorrect assertions that private health insurance membership will decrease. We know Treasury modelling estimates that, after these changes come into effect, 99.7 per cent of people will remain in private health insurance as a result of incentives such as the Lifetime Health Cover and the Medicare Levy Surcharge. Any time there is a change to the way the premium subsidy works, we get railed by that side about how everyone is going to leave their private health insurance and that the public hospital system will be inundated. Can I say that that has never happened. That has not happened any time there have been changes to the private health insurance modelling even under previous governments.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The facts are that 90 per cent of lower income adults should not subsidise the private health insurance of the top 10 per cent of contributors. It is not fair, in our view, that a bank teller who is earning $50,000 should be subsidising the private health insurance of a banker who is taking home $260,000. That is not fair. I think if you go out there and talk to those wealthier Australians, they are probably a bit embarrassed that the people they are employing in their businesses are subsidising their private health insurance. It will not result, in my view or Treasury's view, in an exodus from private health insurance coverage. In fact, eight million Australians will not even be impacted; 2.4 million people will be; 930,000 of those will have their rebate reduced by 10 percentage points; and 780,000 will have their rebate reduced by 20 percentage points. We are talking about 700,000 of the wealthiest Australians who will no longer receive the rebate; 700,000 of the wealthiest Australians who currently have their rebate subsidised in many cases by the people they employ. This is a stunt of the first order and should be opposed.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Victoria</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">17:48</span>):  Before I start talking I notice that the acting Manager of Government Business spoke about the fact that we were not addressing the motion but rather the substance of other issues and then moved straight away to talk about the substance of other issues. I feel as if I have a licence to do so.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Clearly, what we have seen today is another broken promise from this Labor government. When Senator McLucas says the outcome of this motion getting up would be to remove these bills from the <span style="font-style:italic;">Notice Paper</span>, she is absolutely right. That is exactly what we want to do. We want to remove this because we want to keep you to the promise you have made over successive elections. We want you to keep your word to the Australian people, as you did before the last election and the election before that, about what you were going to do. It reminds me of what you have done in relation to the carbon tax, another broken promise. You go into election campaigns, say one thing and then do another.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Do you know how many people supported you on the back of your firm, non-negotiable commitment to keep the private health insurance rebate? Tens of thousands of Australians were warned you would do this, but they said, 'No, surely not.' As Senator Fifield said: 'They believed you. We warned them of what you were going to do.' You sit here and laugh as if it is funny that you can break an election commitment and it is worth giggling about, Senator McLucas. If you find those sorts of things funny, then I think that is a gross indictment on the party that you represent. You broke this promise. You went to two elections saying you would not do it and you have broken it. You went to the last election with a promise on the carbon tax and you broke that. <span style="font-style:italic;">(Time expired)</span></span>

                <span class="HPS-Small">Purpose of the Bill</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Small">Following the release of the initial report of the Remuneration Tribunal (the Tribunal), <span style="font-style:italic;">Review of the Remuneration of Members of Parliament</span>, on 15 December 2011, the Members of Parliament (Life Gold Pass) and Other Legislation Amendment Bill (the bill) seeks to implement the Government's commitment to abolish the Life Gold Pass (LGP) entitlement prospectively so that it is not available to those who enter or re-enter the Parliament following the commencement of the <span style="font-style:italic;">Members of Parliament (Life Gold Pass) and Other Legislation Amendment Act 2012</span>.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Small">The bill also reduces the number of return trips available to an existing LPG holder, who has never held office as Prime Minister, and his or her spouse or de facto partner and the spouse or de facto partner of a sitting member who has qualified for a LGP (entitled person) from 25 to 10 per financial year. Consistent with the Tribunal's recommendation that the entitlement for existing LGP holders be reduced now, the bill includes a transitional provision for the last quarter in this financial year or the date of Royal Assent, whichever is the later, limiting the number of return trips available to two, where the entitled person has at least two unused return trips from his or her 2011-12 financial year entitlement.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Small">The bill also amends the <span style="font-style:italic;">Remuneration Tribunal Act 1973</span> and makes consequential changes to the <span style="font-style:italic;">Parliamentary Contributory Superannuation Act 1948</span> (1948 Act) to grant the Tribunal the power to limit the flow of windfall gains to the superannuation benefits for current and former parliamentarians covered by the 1948 Act, from increases in the additional salary for Ministers of State and parliamentary office holders.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Small">Reasons for Urgency</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Small">The bill should be introduced and passed in the 2012 Autumn sittings to ensure the number of return trips for existing LGP holders is reduced from the start of the 2012-13 financial year. It is also preferable that the transitional provision apply from 1 April 2012. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Small">It is also important that the Tribunal has the capacity to limit any windfall gains that could flow to the superannuation benefits of current and former Ministers of State and parliamentary office holders covered by the 1948 Act, from a determination of the Tribunal on parliamentary remuneration. The Tribunal has indicated that it will not determine any variation in parliamentary remuneration, terms and conditions, or any associated matters, until measures have been enacted to address the potential windfall gains. Delays in passage of the bill will mean that the Tribunal is not able to properly fulfil its role in determining parliamentarian's remuneration.</span>

                      <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Senator BRANDIS</span>
                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Queensland</span>—<span class="HPS-MinisterialTitles">Deputy Leader of the Opposition in the Senate</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">18:02</span>):  The opposition is occasionally and foolishly accused of being too negative. Many of the legislative proposals of the Gillard government are catastrophic and against the national interest. An opposition should always oppose legislation which is against the national interest, and we always will. But an urban myth has developed, fostered and propagated by the Labor Party spin machine, that we oppose everything. As a matter of fact, the opposition has supported the vast majority of the bills brought before the parliament by this government. You do not hear about that in the public debate because ex hypothesi such bills, being uncontroversial, do not generate news. The Nuclear Terrorism Legislation Amendment Bill 2011 is such a bill. It is uncontroversial, like the vast majority of the legislation which the government brings before the chamber, and the opposition, agreeing with its effect, supports it.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The purpose of the bill is to add a new offence to the Nuclear Non-Proliferation (Safeguards) Act 1987 by implementing provisions of the International Convention for the Suppression of Acts of Nuclear Terrorism—known as the 'nuclear terrorism convention'. The nuclear terrorism convention arose from a global initiative established by the United States and the Russian Federation in 2006. One of the fruits of the West's victory in the Cold War is that the United States and the Russian Federation are able to agree and jointly sponsor such beneficial measures. Commonwealth legislation already implements most of the convention obligations. This legislation seeks to ensure that all criminal offences provided for in article 2 of the convention are covered by Commonwealth law. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The amendments in this bill would create new criminal offences for possessing radioactive material or a 'convention device'—a term defined by the convention as including a nuclear explosive device or a device to emit material with radiological properties which may cause death, serious bodily injury or substantial damage to property or the environment; making a convention device; using or damaging a convention device or nuclear facility, or threatening to do so; threatening to use radioactive material; demanding that another person create radioactive material, a convention device or a nuclear facility; and demanding that a third person access or control radioactive material, a convention device or a nuclear facility.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Members of the Australian Defence Force will not be liable to prosecution in respect of acts done in connection with the defence or security of Australia. The convention does not govern the actions of armed forces during an armed conflict. That exemption does not apply to serving personnel whose actions are not connected with the defence or security of Australia or who are otherwise acting unlawfully. The bill does not criminalise the lawful possession and use of radioactive material—for example, material with a medical application. There must be an intention to use or make available the material for a prohibited purpose, such as death or property damage. Whether or not the intended outcomes occurs is not relevant to a prosecution. A maximum penalty of 20 years imprisonment applies to the offences created by the bill. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The bill is directed toward the conduct that all members of the Senate would devoutly hope will never come to pass. Should such threats ever be contemplated, we must ensure that we have the legislative armoury to enable our security and law reform agencies to nip them in the bud. Accordingly, the coalition support the bill—as we do all sensible bills brought to the chamber by this government.</span>

                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Western Australia</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">18:07</span>):  I rise to add the comments of the Australian Greens to the debate on the Nuclear Terrorism Legislation Amendment Bill 2011 and to add my support to that of the coalition for this bill. This bill is Australia's instrument to ratify the 2005 International Convention for the Suppression of Acts of Nuclear Terrorism. This is a threat that has been considered internationally for decades. Indeed, the fears of individuals or state networks illicitly acquiring nuclear materials and using them for deadly ends have been felt for as long as nuclear technology has existed. The very existence of nuclear materials invites these fears and makes them rational to have because this technology is truly terrifying in the scale of its consequences.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">In 1979 the Convention on the Physical Protection of Nuclear Material was adopted in Vienna. This treaty aimed to avert the potential dangers posed by the unlawful taking and use of nuclear material and to protect nuclear material in use, storage and transfer. The events in New York on 11 September 2001, Bali in October 2002, Madrid in 2004 and London in July 2005 prompted that negotiation of the treaty we are discussing today. The International Convention for the Suppression of Acts of Nuclear Terrorism is the 13th antiterrorism convention of the United Nations and the first international accord aimed at fighting against acts of nuclear terrorism. The document, for the first time, defines nuclear terrorist crimes. It fills the gaps in the existing antiterrorism treaty system, it helps improve the international legal framework on antiterrorism and it provides the legal guarantee to prevent and punish acts of nuclear terrorism.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The sentiments that led to the negotiations are summed up very well in a 2005 speech given by the former United Nations Secretary-General Kofi Annan. He said:</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">I firmly believe that our generation can build a world of ever-expanding development, security and human rights—a world "in larger freedom". But I am equally aware that such a world could be put irrevocably beyond our reach by a nuclear catastrophe in one of our great cities.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">In the chaos and confusion of the immediate aftermath, there might be many questions. Was this an act of terrorism? Was it an act of aggression by a state?  Was it an accident? These may not be equally probable, but all are possible. Imagine, just for a minute, what the consequences would be. Tens, if not hundreds, of thousands of people would perish in an instant, and many more would die from exposure to radiation.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">The global impact would also be grave. The attention of world leaders would be riveted on this existential threat. Carefully nurtured collective security mechanisms could be discredited. Hard-won freedoms and human rights could be compromised. The sharing of nuclear technology for peaceful uses could halt. Resources for development would likely dwindle. And world financial markets, trade and transportation could be hard hit, with major economic consequences. This could drive millions of people in poor countries into deeper deprivation and suffering. As shock gave way to anger and despair, the leaders of every nation represented here at this conference—as well as those who are not here—we would have to ask: How did it come to this? Is my conscience clear? Could I have done more to reduce the risk by strengthening the regime designed to do so?</span>
                </p>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The Greens support the intention of this legislation and treaty, but we remind the Senate this is really only a bandaid measure—it is a valuable one, but that is all it is when it comes to identifying the root cause of nuclear terrorism, which is of course the existence of nuclear materials, fissile materials and nuclear weapons.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">As senators would know, the four forms of nuclear terrorism canvassed by this bill include theft or purchase by terrorists of a nuclear weapon from the arsenals of the states that possess nuclear weapons and those states include the United States, Russia, France, the UK, China, India, Israel, Pakistan and the DPRK. The second category is acquisition by terrorists of highly enriched uranium, HEU, or plutonium for use in an improvised nuclear device. The third category is terrorist attacks on or sabotage of vehicles transporting nuclear materials or weapons or on nuclear reactors themselves, which you often hear described as pre-deployed radiological weapons waiting to be detonated by an enemy. Around the world there are also numerous research reactors at universities which have virtually no security at all. Finally, the building and use of radiological dispersal devices, or 'dirty bombs'. This does not involve fissile material but simply dispersing material, whether it be from radioactive sources or material from uranium mines or indeed the dispersal of depleted uranium emissions.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The Weapons of Mass Destruction Commission rightly called their report <span style="font-style:italic;">Weapons of terror</span> because the weapons they had spent some years analysing were designed to terrify as well as destroy. The title was somewhat controversial at the time. They used this terminology because these weapons are in the stockpiles and hands of states. Critics of the treaty in the bill that we are discussing today have noted that it excludes activities of armed forces during an armed conflict and that it does not address the issue of the legality of the use or threat of use of nuclear weapons by states. So, of course, what it effectively does is entrenches the legitimisation of nuclear weapons and fissile materials in the hands of a very small number of states while further criminalising—as is entirely appropriate—the possession or theft of these weapons or materials by nonstate actors or terrorist networks.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The WMD Commission dealt with the threat of nuclear terrorism in lengthy detail in their report but they were also unequivocal on a crucial point. The commission:</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Small">… rejects the suggestion that nuclear weapons in the hands of some pose no threat, while in the hands of others they place the world in mortal jeopardy.

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Explanations by the nuclear haves that the weapons are indispensable to defend their sovereignty are not the best way to convince other sovereign states to renounce the option. This is a debate that is occurring in the Australian defence community at the moment with the reconsideration of the defence white paper. Where do US nuclear weapons fit within Australia's security doctrine? We exist, as we did right through the years of the Cold War until now, under what is called the United States nuclear weapons umbrella—that is, we are not pursuing actively the development of Australian nuclear weapons because we understand that the United States government would use them on our behalf if they had to. Let us think about that for a moment. That entirely legitimises the use of these weapons of genocide in the cause of the defence of Australia. That is completely unnecessary. We need to get out from under the US nuclear umbrella as a way of encouraging our nuclear ally to disarm. Although it is often forgotten and not much remarked upon these days, President Obama came to office with such an extraordinary promise in his speech in Prague shortly after his election about renunciation of these weapons—that is, not simply a non-proliferation agenda: a disarmament agenda. In this respect, the commission was echoing the Canberra commission final document, which says:</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Small">… immediate and determined efforts need to be made to rid the world of nuclear weapons and the threat they pose to it. The destructiveness of nuclear weapons is immense. Any use would be catastrophic.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">That was an extraordinarily valuable effort on behalf of the Australian government and, I think, quite a creative example of middle power diplomacy in order to get our allies to shift their thinking and to shift doctrine.</span>

                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Nuclear weapons and nuclear reactors are themselves the root cause of the problem of nuclear terrorism that is being addressed by this bill and by this treaty that it enshrines. The fact today that the theft of fissile material somewhere can jeopardise security everywhere is not controversial, as Dr Mohamed ElBaradei, the former head of the IAEA, explained when discussing the AQ Khan network, which illicitly sold weapons technology to Libya, North Korea and Iran. He said:</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">The relative ease with which a multinational illicit network could be set up and operated demonstrates the inadequacy of the present export control system. The fact that so many companies and individuals could be involved (more than two dozen, by last count)—and that, in most cases, this could occur apparently without the knowledge of their own governments—points to the shortcomings of national systems for oversight of sensitive equipment and technology. It also points to the limitations of existing international cooperation on export controls, which relies on informal arrangements, does not include many countries with growing industrial capacity, and does not include sufficient sharing of export information with the IAEA.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">… In a modern society characterized by electronic information exchange, interlinked financial systems, and global trade, the control of access to nuclear weapons technology has grown increasingly difficult. The technical barriers to mastering the essential steps of uranium enrichment—and to designing weapons—have eroded over time. Much of the hardware in question is "dual use", and the sheer diversity of technology has made it much more difficult to control or even track procurement and sales.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This reflects some of the comments that I made subsequent to question time here in the Senate this afternoon in the instance of Iran. The technology that you use to enrich nuclear materials for fuel is the same plant, the same factory and the same technologists and engineers that you employ to enrich that same uranium all the way up to weapons grade.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Dr ElBaradei's words are those of a man who deeply believes in nuclear energy, unlike myself, and who headed up an agency with a mandate of promoting nuclear energy. Nonetheless, we are still making a long-term radioactive mess that will be dangerous and usable by terrorists—however you define that term; the international community has still not arrived at a mutually shared definition—for centuries. Solutions to the threat posed by nuclear terrorism obviously involve international cooperation such as the means advanced through the treaty that we ratify through this bill. Obviously eliminating nuclear materials would seriously impede terrorist networks' ability to acquire such materials. Immediately securing all nuclear weapons and weapons-usable material is also obvious. Locking down and eliminating existing fissile material and nuclear weapons and facilities is really the only way to address the danger of nuclear terrorism.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Of course, terrorist networks are very unlikely to blow up a wind farm or make a dirty bomb from a solar panel, but these weapons will continue to exist as long as we give our collective consent to that existence. So, inasmuch as we support the aims of this bill and the work that has gone into it—the international collaboration and the international work that has gone into bringing this bill into this parliament and other parliaments and assemblies around the world—we know that it is only part of the question. This does not deal with the source of the materials. It does not deal with the source of the expertise or any of the rationales why various networks or other states around the world might seek to acquire these weapons. This debate must go further. We pass this bill today but we must proceed further to the debate about how to eliminate these weapons from the arsenals of all nations, including our ally the United States.</span>

                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Tasmania</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">18:19</span>):  I also rise to speak to the Nuclear Terrorism Legislation Amendment Bill 2011, and I acknowledge the contribution by Senator Ludlam. This bill implements the International Convention for the Suppression of Acts of Nuclear Terrorism, a treaty that was signed by Australia in September 2005 and which entered into force generally in 2007. Certainly the passage of this bill is well overdue. Despite many of its provisions already being covered under Australian law, it is important to strengthen our existing legislation and to better complement international regimes to prevent terrorism wherever possible.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Consideration of this bill by the Senate today is in fact timely, as Australia's ratification of the convention will be an important contribution to the second nuclear security summit, to be held in the Republic of Korea next month. The international convention was conceived and created as part of the redoubling of global efforts against terrorism and the changes in the way in which terrorism is and potentially could manifest. Taken together with the International Convention for the Suppression of Terrorist Bombings, the International Convention for the Suppression of Financing Terrorism and the Convention on the Physical Protection of Nuclear Material, this treaty and the legislative change introduced by this bill contribute to a framework for international cooperation on terrorist offences, including investigation and extradition.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">It goes without saying that over the last decade, especially since the tragic events of September 11, 2001 and the attacks on Kuta, Bali, in October 2002, the nature and challenges of asymmetric warfare have become clear. Global terrorist cells have become more widespread, just as they have become more sophisticated. Changes in warfare have necessitated a new legislative response. While the conduct of state actors in conflict has long been dealt with through international humanitarian law—that is, of course, the laws of war—the way in which non-state actors wield the same instruments of destruction requires a specific criminal response. In an age in which nuclear proliferation has been far too widespread and where too often the security around state-held nuclear devices has been vulnerable to degradation and exploitation by organised crime, there exists this terrible prospect that radical organisations willing to resort to political violence rather than peaceful expression may be able to acquire nuclear material.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This legislation, of course, responds to that awful possibility, reinforces Australia's criminal law against political violence in these especially extreme circumstances and sends a message to the international community that Australia stands committed to addressing the threats of global and domestic terrorism. The bill creates new criminal offences of making or possessing radioactive material or a convention device, damaging a nuclear device or a nuclear facility, threatening to use or damage radioactive material, and demanding that another person create radioactive material, a nuclear device or a nuclear facility. Whilst these offences are new under this bill, some other crimes captured under the international convention already exist under Australian law. Each of these offences carries a maximum penalty of 20 years imprisonment, reflecting the gravity of the offence conduct.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The bill inserts a number of new definitions for expressions relevant to the new offences. To ensure consistency with the convention which the bill will implement and in accordance with current drafting practices, the bill adopts the definitions set out in the convention. In recognition of the need to work in concert with our allies and partners overseas, these offences are not limited to conduct by Australians and in Australia but will apply in a broad range of situations where the convention requires state parties to assert jurisdiction.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Importantly, the bill makes a consequential amendment to the Extradition Act 1988 to prevent a person avoiding extradition from Australia for a convention offence by arguing that they had committed a political offence. Understanding the time, I will make the rest of my contribution short, but I would like to add that I strongly believe that the types of offences considered under this legislation are far, far from being considered statements of political expression. We must emphasise, however and wherever we are able, that recourse to violence, especially the types with devastating, enduring effects covered by this bill, can never be excused by any legitimate cause.</span>

Australia takes the proliferation and use of nuclear weapons and related materials seriously and actively participates in a range of international activities and forums designed to reduce proliferation and improve nuclear safety arrangements. Australia is a longtime supporter of the international legal framework for the nonproliferation of nuclear weapons, including as a state party to the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons and the South Pacific Nuclear-Free Zone Treaty. Australia also participates in the Proliferation Security Initiative. The purpose of the initiative is to prevent illicit trafficking in weapons of mass destruction, their delivery systems and related materials.</span>

                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The Nuclear Terrorism Legislation Amendment Bill 2011 will make a contribution to Australia's fight against terrorism and misuse of weapons of mass destruction. Importantly, it will also demonstrate to the international community that Australia is serious about cooperating with other nations to defeat threats to international peace and security. Nuclear terrorism is a horrifying thought. A nuclear terrorist attack could kill millions, lay waste to cities and the environment for decades, and cause grave social and economic dislocation. We hope that the world never sees this day. While our hope is that the probability of this happening is low, we should never discount that possibility. The bill will put in place offences that will allow Australia to more easily prosecute nuclear terrorists. It would also facilitate cooperation with other nations in the fight against nuclear terrorism. The bill forms part of a broad effort by the international community to fight nuclear terrorism. It will allow Australia to ratify the International Convention for the Suppression of Acts of Nuclear Terrorism. It is a significant piece of legislation which sends a strong message to the international community and would-be nuclear terrorists. I commend the bill to the Senate.</span>

It implements the recommendations of the Remuneration Tribunal, released in December last year, which in simple terms are to close the Life Gold Pass scheme to new entrants to this place from the commencement of the bill, including those who have not qualified but re-enter. It also reduces the cap upon the number of domestic return trips eligible for current holders of the Life Gold Pass. It also gives the Remuneration Tribunal the power to determine portions of additional office holder and ministerial salary that may be excluded from the benefits payable to members of the now closed 1948 parliamentary superannuation scheme.</span>

The opposition supports this bill.</span>

                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">New South Wales</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">19:31</span>):  The Greens have long opposed the Life Gold Pass. In July 2009, Senator Bob Brown called for the Life Gold Pass to be reviewed by an independent arbiter. The bill abolishes the Life Gold Pass entitlement prospectively so that it is not available to those who enter the parliament at or after the commencement of the bill. The bill also severs the link between the additional pensions paid under the 1948 superannuation scheme and additional salaries paid to office holders and ministers.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The Life Gold Pass scheme, which in 2010 to 2011 cost taxpayers—cost the public, therefore—$1.3 million, will be closed for new members, and the entitlement of existing members will be reduced from 25 to 10 business class flights a year. While we commend the closure of the scheme, it should be noted that the reason for the rush to pass this bill is to facilitate the Remuneration Tribunal in gifting parliamentarians a pay rise. It has been made clear by the Remuneration Tribunal and the minister that this rise in base salaries from $140,910 to $185,000 per year is contingent on the passage of this bill. The reason for the government and opposition support for the hurried debate of the bill is certainly clear.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The Greens do not support the corres­ponding restoration of the Remuneration Tribunal's power to determine parliamentary base salaries without the power of parliament to disallow the determinations. Surely that should be in place. Transparency and accountability demand that the parliament maintain oversight over such matters. The major parties removed the embarrassment of accepting the pay offer and shed respon­sibility for a pay grab. They are some of the comments that were made when this announcement was made. It is the responsibility of each parliamentarian to justify to the electorate, to the taxpayers, to the public, the remuneration for MPs. Politicians' salaries should be compared with those of ordinary Australians like police, nurses and teachers, not corporate executives who earn millions of dollars. We support the bill but it is important that we note what is behind it.</span>

                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">South Australia</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">19:34</span>):  My contribution will be short, perhaps not quite as short as Senator Ryan's or Senator Rhiannon's, but I think it is important that we put a few things in context, and I have an amendment that I will move in the committee stage of this bill. I understood, when I spoke to the Special Minister of State's office, that the government was not inclined to support the amendment, but I believe in miracles. Who knows? Senator Feeney may have some different news for me, although I doubt it.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We need to put this in context. This bill relates to consequential amendment. It relates to recommendations made arising out of the Belcher review, and that was a very useful process. I would like to commend the work done by former Special Ministers of State Faulkner and Ludwig, and I would particularly like to thank the current Special Minister of State, the Hon. Gary Gray, for the work his office has done to bring about some reforms to the system.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">When we dealt with the issue of the independence of the Remuneration Tribunal, I raised some concerns about issues of transparency and openness, and I will discuss that further in the context of the amendment I will be moving. I think it is very important when we consider legislation such as this that it should not be not about us; it should be about the people who voted for us. The people of Australia are our employers. Their taxes pay our salaries, their votes give us our jobs and their confidence or otherwise, and they determine our futures. Like any employer, the Australian people deserve to have some say in what they pay their employees. There has been a long-time argument that politicians deserve to be paid on an equal footing with other industries—wages relativity, if you like. I think that what the Remuneration Tribunal has done by speaking to a number of MPs—and I was one of those—was a very useful and good exercise. I was impressed with the forensic nature of what they did, and I think that the secretariat of the Remuneration Tribunal should also be commended for their professionalism and the way they tackled the task in their discussions with MPs and senators. I think that was a very good exercise.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">While I accept that if you pay peanuts you are most likely to get monkeys, we cannot forget that our sole purpose in being here is to represent our constituents. Schemes like the Life Gold Pass might not raise an eyebrow in another industry but they erode the faith that Australians have in their representatives. People believe fairly enough that, after we retire, we are not here to enjoy business class flights and comfy pension packages. I can understand why there is significant public opprobrium in relation to the gold pass scheme. I think there is one exception: we need to make sure that our former prime ministers are treated differently. My understanding is that they are, and I do not think we will ever go to the stage—nor should we—of the way they treat former presidents of the United States. It is fair to say that if you have been a Prime Minister of this nation then you have something to offer. You are in demand from the community from all over to discuss and be requested to open an art exhibition or speak on issues of public policy. It is quite reasonable that those gold pass entitlements ought to continue for former prime ministers if they are travelling for the purpose of public duties arising from the fact that they are a former Prime Minister.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I support the government's intentions in this bill and, even though they have been a long time coming, there have been some welcome reforms. I think we need to go further. I propose some amendments to this bill that will require the Remuneration Tribunal to hold public consultations before making a determination into politicians' pay or entitlements, and I will expand on this during the committee stage. I note that the government has previously made changes to the Remuneration Tribunal's operations and their powers. Having true independence is a good thing but it ought to be coupled with greater transparency. I believe those changes need to go further. One of the Australian Labor Party's founding principles is 'a fair day's work for a fair day's wage', and there are not too many who would disagree with that. It should apply to those who make the rules as much as to those who are required to obey them. There needs to be a transparent process for evaluating politicians' pay and entitlements, a process that takes into account the positions of the general public, of interest groups and of politicians themselves. In the real world there are not many people who would get to decide whether they should get a pay rise, and I think that is why it is good that there is now independence on the part of the tribunal.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">It is important to strengthen confidence in the process of politicians' pay and their entitlements and to have a process that is much more transparent, where there is a public hearing process and where public submissions are called for. I note that the Remuneration Tribunal did that in previous years, but mandating that the tribunal do this does not fetter their independence; it is a question of ensuring some essential processes to ensure that occurs. Whether we like it or not there is a higher standard on politicians to be transparent, particularly in respect of the processes that relate to their pay and conditions being altered. It is an honour to serve Australia in this place but it does not make me or anyone here deserving of special treatment, and that is why it is important that this legislation ought to be strengthened. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I will have some questions at the committee stage about the issue of the decoupling of politicians' superannuation, those who were elected prior to the changes in 2004 and these changes. They will be genuine questions as to how this will work and what formula will apply to ensure that there is not an unnecessary windfall, which is the intention of this bill. I want to ask some technical questions in relation to how this will actually work. I would like to hear from my colleagues on all sides as to whether or not they support some greater transparency and why the Remuneration Tribunal, which I think is made up of honourable and capable people, along with its secretariat, would not be able to accommodate these amendments to have a much better system of determining politicians' pay and entitlements.</span>

                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Victoria</span>—<span class="HPS-MinisterialTitles">Parliamentary Secretary for Defence</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">19:41</span>):  I thank senators for their contributions to this debate on the Members of Parliament (Life Gold Pass) and Other Legislation Amendment Bill 2012. This bill is a further demonstration of the government's commitment to reform the parliamentary entitlements framework. In 2009 the government commissioned an independent committee chaired by Ms Barbara Belcher AO to review parliamentary entitlements. On 24 March 2011, the Special Minister of State tabled the committee's report and introduced the Remuneration and Other Legislation Amendment Bill 2011, which restored the power of the independent Remuneration Tribunal to determine the parliamentary base salary of parliamen­tarians. On that day the Special Minister of State also agreed to the tribunal's request that it consider the other recommendations of the committee's report and to make recom­mendations on parliamentarians' tools of trade and other entitlements issues. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The tribunal released its initial report into the review of the remuneration of members of parliament on 15 December 2011 and the government has moved immediately to accept key recommendations of this report, including that the Life Gold Pass scheme be closed prospectively; that the travel entitlement of Life Gold Pass holders be reduced; and that the link between additional pensions under the Parliamentary Contri­butory Superannuation Scheme, the 1948 scheme, and additional salaries for serving parliamentary office holders and ministers be severed. This bill implements those recommendations of the independent tribunal.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Once this bill takes effect, the Life Gold Pass scheme will be closed to those who enter or re-enter the parliament. The travel entitlement of existing Life Gold Pass holders who have never held office as Prime Minister and their spouses or de facto partners will be reduced from 25 to 10 domestic return trips per financial year from the 2012-13 financial year. Sitting senators and members will remain eligible to accrue an entitlement to a Life Gold Pass where they serve the remainder of their relevant qualifying period prior to leaving the parliament. Further, a sitting senator or member who ceases to be a member of their house and who becomes a member of the other chamber within three months will be regarded as having had continuous service in the parliament and will continue to be eligible for a Life Gold Pass. In accordance with the tribunal's recommendation that the travel entitlement of Life Gold Pass holders be reduced immediately, the bill introduces a transitional provision which limits the number of domestic return trips for the remainder of 2011-12 to a maximum of two. This provision will apply from the later of the day on which the bill receives the royal assent or 1 April 2012.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">As senators may be aware, serving ministers of state and parliamentary office holders receive additional salaries as a percentage of parliamentary base salary. Any increase in the parliamentary base salary determined by the tribunal would then flow to the additional salaries of ministers of state and parliamentary office holders. The measures in this bill will allow the Remuneration Tribunal to limit any windfall gains from increases in the additional salaries of office holders and ministers of state flowing to the superannuation benefits for current and former parliamentarians. These measures complement similar arrangements approved by the parliament last year, in the Remuneration and Other Legislation Amendment Act 2011, in relation to increases in the parliamentary base salary for members of parliament.</span>

I commend the bill to the Senate.</span>

                    </a>  The parliamentary secretary Senator Feeney said that is the case. It was a good, direct answer, which is what I expect from Senator Feeney. My question is this: how will the formula be derived at? Has the tribunal indicated to the government the sorts of things that it will be looking at? I understand the independence of the tribunal—I get that—but how will the tribunal look at those issues to ensure that there will not be an undue benefit or, arguably, an undue detriment to those members of parliament elected prior to 2004? The other issue, which would also apply to the issue of the gold pass, is whether consideration has been given as to whether there is any potential for legal action by any aggrieved members of parliament—presumably former members of parliament—in terms of the gold pass being reduced. Would they argue that it is taking away a property right? Similarly, has advice been obtained in relation to the issue of superannuation benefits for those elected prior to 2004, particularly those who may have retired?</span>

                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">
                    <a href="I0O" type="MemberSpeech">
                      <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Senator FEENEY</span>
                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Victoria</span>—<span class="HPS-MinisterialTitles">Parliamentary Secretary for Defence</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">19:48</span>):  Thank you, Senator Xenophon. I begin by outlining, in general, the government's position with respect to your amendments, before turning to some of the particular points you made in those remarks.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Firstly, as you foreshadowed, Senator Xenophon, the government does not support your proposed amendments—that is, to add a schedule to the bill prescribing a process for the way the independent Remuneration Tribunal goes about making a determination or a report about members of parliament. It is the government's view that it is a matter for the independent Remuneration Tribunal to determine how best to undertake the task of determining remuneration levels within its jurisdiction. It is already open to the tribunal to take submissions and conduct hearings, and the tribunal can also publish submissions received and the transcripts of hearings.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The easiest way I could sum this up is to say that the public hearings you are seeking may be entirely possible. It is, of course, within the remit of the tribunal to conduct its affairs in that way if it so chooses, but the legislation does not mandate it. Rather, the legislation seeks to emphasise the independence of the tribunal to conduct its affairs as it sees fit. The government submits that the proposed amendments submitted by Senator Xenophon would constrain the independent tribunal's discretion in this matter.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">It is worth noting that the tribunal undertook a wide range of public consultations in the lead-up to its most recent reports regarding members of parliament, departmental secretaries and specified statutory office holders. The Remuneration Tribunal already has transparency measures in place. The tribunal is already required by section 7A of the Remuneration Tribunal Act 1973 to publish full details of its reports. In relation to its most recent report into the remuneration of parliamentarians, the tribunal published a detailed report of 67 pages, with 227 pages of appendices for those who have the stomach for it, as well as a related consultant report and an accompanying statement. The tribunal is also subject to the Freedom of Information Act 1982 and, as such, any submissions to the tribunal may be accessed under the act, subject to any necessary exemptions. For these reasons, the government does not support the amendments proposed by Senator Xenophon.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Firstly, with respect to the question, 'Does the tribunal need the power to determine a portion of additional office holder salaries that will not flow to members of the 1948 scheme?' the answer is yes. In its report of 15 December 2011, the Remuneration Tribunal indicated that the link in the 1948 scheme between the additional salary of a current office holder in parliament or a minister of state and the additional pension of a retired parliamentarian be severed. The bill achieves this outcome by extending the tribunal's existing power in the Remuneration Tribunal Act 1973 to determine a portion of parliamentary base salary not to be taken as parliamentary allowance for the purpose of the 1948 scheme. These new powers will allow the tribunal to similarly determine a portion of additional salary that is not to be taken into account for superannuation purposes. The tribunal indicated in its statement that it does not intend to make a determination on the remuneration of parliamentarians until this issue has been resolved.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Secondly, the government does not consider that the closure of the Life Gold Pass scheme, and the reduction in the number of domestic return trips available under entitlement, is an acquisition of property within the meaning of paragraph 51(xxxi) of the Constitution. This issue was considered in 2002, when limits were first introduced on the number of return domestic trips provided by the Life Gold Pass scheme, and resulted in a constitutional safety net provision being included in the Members of Parliament (Life Gold Pass) Act 2002. This bill includes an equivalent provision to provide a reasonable amount of compensation in circumstances where any provisions in the bill are found to result in an acquisition of property under section 51(xxxi) of the Constitution.</span>

He made out that the problem with Senator Xenophon's amendments is that they will constrain the independence of the tribunal. But he really has not established that case at all. I think this is an important point for our consideration. I congratulate Senator Xenophon. I am sure he will not mind me saying that what he has put forward here is very minimal. It is certainly not a constraint; it is just setting out some very minor issues of process. That is all we have here. Let us remind ourselves what the essence of that is: there should be a call for public submissions; there should be a website where those submissions can be received and there should be a public hearing conducted—and there are a few other process issues. So Senator Feeney's statement that the independence of the tribunal will be restrained—which obviously nobody would want to do—has not been established. I would ask that the senator set out his arguments for making that statement, which, from what I heard, was the whole basis of his argument for dismissing Senator Xenophon's amendments. I would be interested in his arguments.</span>

It really goes to the point of the independence of the tribunal. It is the view of the government, as set out in the legislation, that the tribunal itself ultimately determines how best to undertake the important task of determining the remuneration levels within its jurisdiction. It is obviously given an independence—</span>

                    </a>  I am just responding to the question. As I said earlier in response to Senator Xenophon, the public hearings, which he in particular is seeking, would not be precluded by the tribunal; rather, it is our view that the tribunal, in determining how best to go about its business, will have discretion as to whether that is or is not appropriate. That is a matter for the tribunal. I understand that in your view, Senator Rhiannon, we should mandate or require that. I would simply say that that is a difference of opinion between you and the government. Our view is that the legislation means the tribunal is able to contemplate what you are seeking but is not required to do so.</span>

I think it is appropriate that I move those amendments now, but I may have some further questions in the committee stage about how widely disseminated the call for submissions was and what sorts of submissions the tribunal got in respect of their quite comprehensive report of December last year. I seek leave to move the amendments as a whole.</span>

It is a case of these amendments being quite straightforward. These amendments do not constrain—in any way, whatsoever—the independence of the tribunal in making a determination about the salary, conditions and entitlements of members of parliament. But it sets up a process that guarantees a certain benchmark of transparency. To require that certain benchmark of transparency is not onerous and is essential for public confidence in the whole issue of politicians' pay and entitlements. It would help demystify the process; it would help strengthen public confidence in the process by which politicians are remunerated and how their pay and conditions are set. That would unambiguously be a good thing. At the moment there seems to be too much mystery. There is something to be said for having this benchmark of transparency.</span>

Politicians are employed to serve the Australian public. I think it only fair that the Australian public be involved in that process in a transparent fashion. This bill makes amendments to the definition of salary and allows the tribunal to make determinations of what constitutes salary for the purpose of assessing superannuation. Therefore, there is a direct relevance to these amendments, because they relate to the heart of what is being proposed. These amendments would not have been necessary, in a sense, had it not been for the subject matter of the bill and what is being proposed.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I note that Senator Feeney has indicated the government's opposition to this. I ask Senator Feeney if he would concede that the independence of the tribunal to make determinations as to the pay and conditions and entitlements of members of parliament is not in any way constrained by this bill. There is simply a requirement to have advertisements for public hearings, to conduct a public hearing, to have submissions that can be published on the website subject to the consent of those making the submissions and to at least make reference to the submissions that have been made and to the evidence heard in the course of a public hearing. I say to Senator Feeney, with his eminent legal background—I say that without any irony whatsoever: how does that impinge on the independence of the tribunal? The tribunal could hear all this evidence and go through the process that is suggested or mandated in this amendment. It can still decide what it wants to decide, but at least the Australian people will know that there has been a benchmark of accountability and transparency in the process.</span>

Regarding the requirement for the tribunal to advertise that it is seeking submissions, to obtain submissions, to publish those submissions with consent and to hold a public hearing, it does not say how long the hearing has to be. It could be a 30-minute hearing, which would be problematic. But, if it were a one-day hearing in Canberra or a half-day hearing, how on earth does that impinge on the independence of the tribunal? That is what the government is saying, through Senator Feeney's answer.</span>

It really is very simple. It is within the remit of the tribunal to do all of the things you have described. We have in no way constrained its powers. It may very well undertake the course of action that you are suggesting. But it is the government's view that the independence of the tribunal must be enshrined and maintained and that it must govern its own affairs. It may very well do the things that you are describing, but we are not mandating that it does.</span>

                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">South Australia</span>) (20:06):  Senator Feeney made reference to the issue of public confidence. Does the government believe that there would be greater public confidence in the process of setting the pay and conditions of members of parliament if there is a process that would involve public submissions and a public hearing? It is my understanding that he does not disagree with that proposition—that there would be greater public confidence in the process if the tribunal undertook, for instance, the public submissions and the public hearing, referring to the evidence that was obtained and heard.</span>

It is equally my firm view that that public confidence will be strengthened by the fact that this tribunal is independent—independent of politicians and the decisions of politicians—and is able to go about its business and to govern its own inquiry process. I believe that that governance—that independence—will ensure that its future determinations have the confidence of the public.</span>

In short, I note that Senator Xenophon earlier commended the work of the Remuneration Tribunal in recent months. The opposition agrees that the current legislation allows the tribunal to conduct investigations as it sees fit. Everything Senator Xenophon has proposed is quite within the powers of the tribunal to conduct at the moment. The very independence that parliament has granted the tribunal is critical to generating the public confidence that I think we all share with Senator Xenophon. The opposition does not see the need to mandate a particular course of action for the now independent Remuneration Tribunal. We will not be supporting the amendments.</span>

It seems that there is no real dispute that the more transparent and robust the process, the greater the degree of public confidence. But you do not want to mandate that, notwithstanding that the tribunal is still free to decide whatever it wants to decide in terms of politicians' pay and entitlements.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I have a budgetary question. It goes to the ability of the tribunal to have a public process. In other words, if it wanted to advertise and hold a public hearing for a day, two days or more, is there any provision in the current budget of the tribunal for that to take place? If there is not, would the government be in a position to say, here and now, that if the tribunal made a request, 'We want to hold public hearings; we want to hear the submissions'—because it has been flooded with submissions and they have to be duly considered—the government would provide the necessary resources for the tribunal to carry out its work? If it does not have adequate resources then that raises issues of its ability to carry out its functions appropriately and independently.</span>

I am advised that, should the tribunal resolve to go down the course of seeking public hearings, then that would, in all likelihood, mean that the tribunal's small budget would require budget supplementation in order to meet such requirement. In the event that the tribunal resolves upon a process which engenders more costs, that is something the tribunal would then raise with the minister.</span>

I will decline your invitation. It is not for me to imagine future scenarios and engage in hypotheticals. I really cannot go any further than to say that should the tribunal seek to adopt a course of action whereby it requires additional resources then it would, of course, put such a request to the relevant minister.</span>

                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">South Australia</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">20:12</span>):  I just say that I am disappointed in the position of both the government and the opposition. I think that here was an oppor­tunity to strengthen transparency, accoun­tability and processes. Senator Ryan quite accurately reflected my views of the Remuneration Tribunal. I think that they have done a good job in terms of improving processes and in their publishing of decisions. I thought they were quite rigorous and robust but fair in the processes by which they dealt with members of parliament in taking a forensic view of their roles and the like. I have confidence, based on their past record, that if they were mandated to do this—to have public hearings and to request public submissions—they would do a very good job.</span>

We had an opportunity with this amendment tonight to say that we have confidence in this process in the sense that we can mandate these requirements. I think we would have brought some significant members of the public with us to say that this is a better process. I am happy for this to be put to a vote. I will be seeking a division, come what may.</span>

                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Tasmania</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">20:23</span>):  I rise to make a contribution to the debate on the Intellectual Property Laws Amendment (Raising the Bar) Bill 2011 [2012]. The coalition is broadly supportive of this piece of legislation, but we also recognise that a number of elements remain to be considered in relation to intellectual property in this country.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The opposition has undertaken considerable consultation during considera­tion of its position on this piece of legislation. We have spoken to a broad range of interested parties in relation to the bill. During that consultation a number of issues were raised with us, and I will detail those shortly. I also note that there are a number of issues around intellectual property that concern a number of members of this chamber. However, during our consultations, the bottom line was that this piece of legislation is broadly beneficial; those we consulted with would prefer that this legislation be passed so that work can continue with other elements that remain of concern to those we have spoken to. We have given that commitment to continue to work on those matters.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We understand that government thinks this is the full kit as far as managing issues around intellectual property might be concerned, but it is quite obvious from our consultations that there remains some work to be done.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The bill amends the Patents Act 1990, the Trade Marks Act 1995, the Copyright Act 1968, the Designs Act 2003 and the Plant Breeder's Rights Act 1994. The bill is divided into six schedules.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The first schedule relates to the quality of granted patents and addresses concerns that the threshold in Australia for granting patents is too low, and I am certain some of my colleagues will address some of that later in the debate. I know there are some particular concerns around the granting of patents for human and plant genes. With respect to where Australia sits at the moment, the concern was that the threshold was too low and that patents were granted for inventions that were not sufficiently inventive. So this piece of legislation addresses that to a certain extent.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Schedule 2 provides for free access to patent inventions for regulatory approvals and research. That is an issue that has been discussed at length; it has been the subject of a couple of Senate reports around patenting breast cancer research. The intention of this schedule is to ensure that free access to patent inventions for regulatory approvals and research is freed up.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Schedule 3 looks at reducing delays in resolution of patent and trademark applications.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Schedule 4 looks at assisting the operations of the IP profession. That provides for amendments to the patents and trademarks acts to allow for registration and regulation of incorporated patent attorneys and to extend the same client-attorney professional privileges as currently exist for communications between a lawyer and their client.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Schedule 5 relates to improving mechanisms for trademark and copyright enforcement.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Schedule 6 amends the patents, trademarks, design and plant breeder's rights acts, to remove some procedural hurdles, streamline processes and make improvements to ensure the system is fit for purpose in the increasingly electronic and globalised business environment.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">My colleagues and I have heard that—as with other legislation—although there was government consultation, there was a question as to whether it was effective. A number of people have told us that they made submissions but received no response—in other words, their submissions were effectively ignored.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">There are some concerns around the practicality of implementing some sections of the legislation, particularly relating to jurisdiction of the courts for criminal matters. It appears that even members of the bench are confused. One submission we received was in respect of a practical issue relating to the mechanics of issuing court proceedings for summary offences and the difficulties in ensuring court or courts have jurisdiction to hear such matters—being in the midst of running a criminal prosecution for breaches of the Trademarks Act 1995—it is clear that there is a considerable amount of doubt amongst the bar and the profession, and even from the bench, on this issue. There is also concern around the ability of Customs to provide the required information to brand owners in respect of Customs seizures. That relates to the sophistication of many businesses involved with counterfeit operations and concerns around Customs regarding the ability of Customs to effectively pull together the threads of deception. We know that some of these counterfeit operations are extremely sophisticated and we have heard concerns expressed in relation to other elements of Customs operations. There is cost shifting within Customs to increase capacity in some regions, but at the expense of others, and that obviously remains a concern for people within this industry in relation to products coming in and the capacity to bring in small quantities of product on a regular basis that might be scoping the system.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We note that there might be a need for further reforms to section 41 of the Trademarks Act, and we will continue to look at that. I also note that in respect of schedule 2 there is some concern from agricultural chemical companies around the capacity for springboarding. I acknowledge that that has some benefits with respect to providing cheaper product in the context of generics into the market, ensuring that the effective time for a patent and the protection that provides is provided to the industry and not too much more, but I do note that there remained some concern about the viability around some particular products coming into the market if that period is shortened too much. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">With respect to schedule 5, I note that the Senate Standing Committee for the Scrutiny of Bills has provided comment regarding the proposed penalties and offences under schedule 5, item 27. Notably, the committee leaves to the Senate as a whole the question of whether the provisions under this item are appropriate. The coalition does not have any specific comments to make in relation to this piece of legislation, but, as I said at the outset, given the consultation that we have had, despite the concerns raised by industry that there are a number of issues that remain to be dealt with surrounding the issue of intellectual property in Australia, I know that this will be addressed by colleagues as this debate proceeds. There is no question, given the strength of the submissions that the coalition has received as part of its consultation process, that this legislation in its current form should be allowed to pass the parliament so that the benefits it provides to the operations of IP can be taken advantage of. Some work does need to be done to follow up on the other issues that, I have no doubt, will be raised as this debate proceeds. The coalition will be supporting this legislation, despite some concerns that we continue to have.</span>

                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">
                    <a href="H6V" type="MemberSpeech">
                      <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Senator BOYCE</span>
                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Queensland</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">20:33</span>):  As my colleague Senator Colbeck has pointed out, the coalition is broadly supportive of the Intellectual Property Laws Amendment (Raising the Bar) Bill 2011 as a result of not only the inquiries that took place but also the extensive consultation undertaken by the coalition with business, industry representatives and the legal profession. Public consultation on this bill started in May 2009, and there were some issues raised during those consultations, but the majority of industry is urging this parliament to proceed with the bill.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I am a passionate advocate of the Australian intellectual property system. Our system of trademarks, patents and registered designs is the absolute underpinning of industry and service provision in this country. Without it there would be fewer products, less commerce and much less happening in Australia. I took part, as did my colleague Senator Heffernan, in the gene patents inquiry. Whilst I am sure that Senator Heffernan will want to talk a lot more about some of the issues there, there are some very well-intentioned people who have some serious issues with the patent system as it currently is in Australia. In my view, we cannot sacrifice the broad intellectual property system in Australia for the sake of some quite narrow concerns. Not unreasonably, one of the primary issues that has to be dealt with is what constitutes a discovery—which of course is not patentable—and what constitutes an invention. This was certainly dealt with a lot in a narrow context within the gene patents inquiry, but it is a far broader issue than the use of gene patents. It applies right across our entire patents industry.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Other concerns that were raised during the inquiries were around the reasonable use of patented materials for research and looking at better ways to undertake testing. It does not apply just in the gene patents area. Concerns were also raised by academics—who of course are not patent lawyers—about what they could do in terms of legitimate research using patented products and what they could not do. Currently, in the law, there are no statutory provisions clarifying researchers' freedom to conduct experiments. There is uncertainty about the scope of any existing common law protection and this leads to inefficiencies in research. Researchers are discouraged from taking up new lines of research when there is uncertainty about their liability for infringing a patent. That uncertainty can lead to researchers who, in Australia, are not the best resourced people to spend a lot of effort and expense trying to find out whether they are going to be behaving legally or illegally. The bill seeks to actually give them the opportunity to be very certain about where their research sits within this framework.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">There was evidence given during the gene patents inquiry that in fact this law was unnecessary because reasonable research was acceptable under the law as it currently stood. However, we heard that evidence from very well resourced, very large medical groups. It was the smaller groups, who perhaps had the best opportunity to come up with some interesting research, who were very worried about whether they could go ahead with that research and simply did not have the in-house resources to know the answer. This bill is designed to fix that aspect.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The other concern that was raised during that inquiry was the interaction of regulatory approval processes with the patent legislation. Obviously, regulatory approval processes are extremely important in ensuring that Australians have good-quality, high-standard, safe products in every aspect. But we did not want unintended consequences of the interaction of those regulatory processes with patents law, which basically meant that in some cases patent terms could be extended well beyond the maximum 20 years. This activity was known in other places as 'evergreen'. It is an unintended consequence that a company, by somehow tweaking a patent, may have the opportunity to extend that patent well beyond the original 20 years they were given for the patent.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We need to think about why patents exist. What are they there for? They are there to encourage and reward innovation and clever invention. No company is going to spend the money that is required in researching and developing new products, new technologies and new ways of doing things without some sort of sense that they can recoup their investment by having what is effectively a monopoly in a field for a certain length of time. In the majority of cases this is up to 20 years.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I hoped to speak a little bit about the history of intellectual property in Australia, because we are very good at it. We introduced the first prepaid postal system in 1838; the first combine harvester in 1882; the first automated locomotive brake system in 1904, which was in fact the first-ever patent that was issued under Australia's law; and the first electric drill. How would half of Australia cope at the weekend without the invention of the first electric drill, which was patented in Australia in 1889? In 1926 we patented the world's first electronic pacemaker. Think about that: 1926. There have been improvements on that since. There are hosts more: the tank used in warfare, the box kite, the wine cask. We were even the first people in the world to codify and afterwards copyright a kicking ball game. That was in 1875 when the 10 basic rules of Aussie Rules were developed and, as I said, copyrighted. Vegemite is another creation that was protected by IP statutes in 1922.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The Australian Patent Office in fact opened in Melbourne in 1904, but the Australian government's involvement in protecting Australian innovation and development began in the previous century with the individual state registers of trademarks, patents and copyrights. It was in 1904 that we got our act together nationally. I was quite interested to look at some of the statistics provided by Intellectual Property Australia, which is the organisation we have to thank for the impetus behind the amendments proposed in the Raising the Bar bill. In 2010 the United States, perhaps not unsurprisingly, led the world with over 10,500 patent applications. But we came second. There were 2,409 patent applications in 2010 from Australia. In the world of trademarks, as opposed to patents, we came first with 68,241. There may well be an argument to say that this simply means that it is too easy to trademark something in Australia. There may be some truth in that. But it is not just about that. It is also about the fact that we are a very innovative and inventive nation. Without legal support for that, it is not going to continue.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I am indebted to IPA who used the Sydney to Hobart Yacht Race as an example of how intellectual property underpins so many aspects of our lives. What do you see as the race starts? You see brand names, logos and trademarks. The race is core marketing for major corporations. But without those brand names, logos and trademarks and the safety, protection and security of them, this would not exist. We are talking millions of dollars when you add in naming rights, broadcast rights and the brand-naming sponsorship of crews. Whether this marketing investment would happen without the protection of the intellectual property of those companies through their registered trademarks is another question.</span>

But without this Australia is not going to survive as a commercial or industrial society. Without the money trademarks create, the Sydney to Hobart yacht race broadcast itself would be of poorer quality. There would not be live satellite crosses, onboard yacht cameras or views from helicopters, because all the technology used to create all of those is in many cases patented. It would not happen without a patent system.</span>

A world without intellectual property, without patents, would mean slower boats. Racing yachts are in fact made from patented materials that are also used in the aeronautical and motor racing industries. The locator beacons, the Gore-Tex, and I should probably draw the little circle with the 'R' in the middle, the foul weather gear, the Spectra and Dyneema ropes, and the Kevlar sails are used—and, again, we need all those registered trademarks—and are all supported by trademarks and by intellectual property.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Patents, as I have said, are granted across a very, very broad array of products and processes, from industrial machinery to pharmaceuticals and even to toys. They represent innovation, improvement and advancement. They apply in every part of our lives, and it is quite interesting sometimes to look at some of the history of them. The can-opener, for example, was a patented product. The seatbelt was a patented product. In 1879, a 'parachute hat' that was designed to allow the wearer to leap safely from a burning building was patented. I presume from the fact that we are not all running around with a parachute hat in our back pocket suggests that this was not one of the world's greater inventions.</span>

One of the key components of our innovative economy is our intellectual property regime. I could go on to talk considerably more about the intellectual property regime in Australia, but I want to congratulate IPA on the work that they have done to develop the amendments to our legislation that are contained in the bill and to acknowledge that intellectual property in Australia applies across a very broad field of activity. It is not limited to one or two products.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I congratulate IPA on the work they have done in getting this to the stage where it becomes legislation in this house and the fact that we now have the chance to pass legislation that will not just support and underpin research and further invention but also ensure that the activities that are undertaken by people who hold patents are legitimate and recognise honestly their need to make a profit out of their product without it giving them the opportunity to pork-barrel those inventions into the future. I think this legislation is a good start. There are some concerns about it, but it is a balanced approach to underwriting, supporting and strengthening an absolutely crucial part of the structure of our economy.</span>

                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">New South Wales</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">20:50</span>):  Well, where do I start? That was a fairly off-the-subject sort of way of working out what is discovery and what is invention. Can I say that this bill does not address the core problem. There is a lot of gutless rhetoric that has been given by government bureaucrats and people who have spoken on this which does not address the question: why are we allowing the patenting of discoverable material to be included in inventive patents? So as to highlight the fundamental flaw, which is not addressed by this bill, Senator Boyce talked about a can-opener being patented, the point being that the steel that the can-opener was made of is not itself patented; the inventive use of the steel is. The problem we have in the patent world—and Australia is a soft entry point for patents globally—is that we have included in the patents, which have now been challenged in Australian and American courts, the discoverable material. No-one was allowed to discover and patent the moon and, Senator Scullion, you cannot patent the wood in a tree—but you, being a clever bushie, might be able to patent a use of the wood. You might have been able to make a smart boomerang, but you could not actually patent the wood that the boomerang was made out of. This argument is as simple as that, and there is a lot of gutless political cover given to that. Politicians have been intimidated by the commercial world, and I have to say they are winning the argument.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">When the minister last rose to speak in support of this bill last June, he described it as 'a major reform of the intellectual property system'. He also said it would 'ensure that Australia maintains a world-class intellectual property system'. But, at the same time, he did not have the courage politically to define the line between discovery and invention, so who is he kidding? The legislation does absolutely nothing of the kind. It really only feathers the nest of patent lawyers—and we have had plenty of them through the inquiry—patent attorneys and their mostly foreign owned clients. Australia is a soft entry point. The legislation ignores the opportunity to make real and lasting reforms. Why wouldn't you allow the freeing up of access to the discoverable material—that is, the gene? This bureaucratic—I will not say BS argument, but it is—</span>

                    </a>  Yes, ignore it—that discoverable material is patented or not. This is all about saying, 'Well, we'll give an exemption for research.' All right. Suppose I am a laboratory and, Madam Acting Deputy President, I apply to you for research because you hold the patent on the gene that I want to research. I have a smarter laboratory and a smarter technician than you, and I beat you to the commercialisation prize. So then do I go back to you and say, 'Can I now have an exemption so I can commercialise my research?' You will say no. If you do not say no, why did you have the patent on the gene in the first place? It is an absurdity to say that you will give an exemption for research when it naturally follows that you will need an exemption for the commercialisation of that research.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The argument put by all the phoneys in the debate is that, if you do this, you will somehow have a decline in research. You will not at all. This is not about banning inventive work to be patented—work that has an inventive step and a commercial and useful purpose. You can certainly patent it. This bill is about nullifying the argument through some phoney clause that you can give an exemption for research, which does not address the question of how you then proceed to give an exemption for the commercialisation when someone else is holding the patent. Most people, when you talk to them, say, 'How in God's name can you patent something that is naturally occurring in your body?' This is the bureaucratic answer to the minister—certainly in the case of the Department of Innovation, Industry, Science and Research as opposed to the Department of Health and Ageing. By the way, just for the record, the department of health is seriously opposed to the view of the department of industry on this, because the department of health knows the added cost to health care in the case of biological materials for pharmaceuticals. We have not even begun to talk about the cartel that is growing in the seed world for food production; we will get to that. Do not ask me what this has to do with a tin-opener, as demonstrated, or the Sydney to Hobart yacht race.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This is about having the guts to say—which is clearly demonstrated at law—that discoverable material is not patented. What is in your body no-one invented, but people did discover it. We now have medical opportunities for research and enhancement of human life, which includes multiple series of genetic sequences. So, if you are tucked away in the back of Westmead Hospital in a little room on a six-month contract because the hospital cannot guarantee you any longer than six months—which is actually a fact of how it works—how can you mount a case against a bunch of lawyers and a multinational to defend your rights to do research on a gene that is naturally occurring? The phoney argument is, 'Oh, well, we've isolated it; therefore it's materially different from what's in your body.' That is absolute rubbish. It is identically the same. There is no material difference. We demonstrated that through estimates, and IP Australia was up there versus the health department, and they were fundamentally opposed during the hearing. This is just cheap political cover.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I just take you to an example. I have asked to table some documents of a court case which I am about to address, and hopefully they can be tabled. The government have those documents and they have said that it is okay to table them. I raised this in estimates the other day. A French pharmaceutical company called Sanofi-Aventis succeeded in absolutely hoodwinking Australia and the patent office into giving an extension—one of these evergreening patents—for a drug called clopidogrel. As a result, the total period of the patent protection, which was due to expire in 2013, was nearly 30 years. The second patent, however, was revoked in 2009 by the full Federal Court. The High Court refused to interfere. These are the problems here. First is the cost to the PBS. When the pharmaceutical company took out the injunction to go to the High Court against the generic company in 2007, it said in the injunction—and the documents back this up—that it would recompense the Commonwealth for any loss to it through the extra funding of the PBS, instead of having the generic brand. The reality was that the cost to the Commonwealth in that time was $60 million. The High Court refused and the pharmaceutical company lost, but the Commonwealth has not collected, and I presume it will probably spend $60 million in legal fees to try to get it. The cost from when the original patent ran out to the present time is somewhere between $480 million and $600 million extra because of the evergreening effect of the patent, which has been declared invalid. And who in the government has got the guts to go to the pharmaceutical company and say, 'We would like compensation for that?' This is just one pharmaceutical line. It is because of the flaws in the patent law, where patents are allowed to include the genetic material which is naturally occurring.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I assure you that, if you thought about it, without biotech and patent lawyers whispering—as they do around this building—you would agree that no-one invented the BRCA genetic mutations linked to breast and ovarian cancers, but they were certainly a discoverable material. Yet here we are about to vote on a bill that the minister says makes all the problems about the patent system, including the ones I have just talked about, go away. That is as big a furphy as Myriad's claim to have invented the BRCA human genes that cause breast cancer. There is a legal process and, as we all know, the courts are not actually about truth. If you have ever been to court you will discover that the courts are about the law. If you are guilty, you get a good solicitor or a lawyer or a barrister, not to tell a lie but to use the law to avoid the truth. It goes on all the time. It happened the other day. I had better not mention the case, but if you take a trip to The Gap you will find the case. Rather than give research scientists an exemption from patent infringement, which is one of the things this bill's so-called improvements do, wouldn't it be better and more efficient if the scientists' knew upfront that any discoveries of nature, such as the BRCA human genes, are simply not patentable? Everyone agrees that you cannot patent discoverable material but no-one wants to draw the line between discovery and invention. As for raising the inventive step threshold—it is actually lowering the bar—what is the point of the exercise when IP Australia, the patent attorneys and the patent pharmaceutical companies can drive a truck through the loophole? It is as simple as that. This bill may be well intended but it does not address the problems.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I would just like to go to Senate estimates and define this one pharmaceutical item. In March 2010, two years ago, the High Court of Australia rejected an application for leave to appeal in a patent case concerning the drug Clopidogrel. Until then, the drug had been subject to two Australian patents. The original patent over the chemical compound expired in 2003. Sanofi-Aventis, the patent owner, had applied for and was granted a second patent—as we call an evergreening patent—over virtually the same chemical compound. The difference was immaterial, so the full Federal Court found. The second patent was due to expire in 2013 because the Federal Court held that it was invalid. A decision of the High Court was not prepared to interfere with it and the second patent came to a premature end in March 2010. This saved the PBS and the Australian taxpayers tens of millions of dollars and is a good example of the issue of lax patents being granted by IP Australia. Globally we are known as a soft entry point for patents.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Here is the problem. As part of the legal proceedings, the pharmaceutical company Sanofi sought and was granted an interim injunction to prevent Apotex, a generic medicines company, from marketing a generic version of this particular pharmaceutical. That was back in September 2007. As a result of the injunction, the generic company Apotex was enjoined from marketing the generic version and this resulted in two things. First was the automatic price reduction of 12½ per cent, which, by the way, is now 16 per cent, that applies to any PBS listed drug on market entry or if a generic version does not happen. This is why the Department of Health and Ageing are really concerned about the patent law, whereas the Department of Innovation, Industry, Science and Research, which is driven by all the lawyers and their promoters and the people who creep around this building giving you stuff and getting paid good money to do it, have a different view. This meant the PBS had to keep paying the same price to Sanofi-Aventis that it agreed to under the PBS while a patent was alive. Secondly, it was a condition of the grant of the interim injunction that Sanofi-Aventis agreed to compensate any party, which included the Commonwealth, adversely affected by the interim injunction. This means that when the High Court of Australia refused the application for special leave to appeal, that condition to the interim injunction took effect. No-one has done anything about it.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The estimated cost of the interim injunction between September 2007, when the injunction was granted, and March 2010, when the injunction was lifted, to the Commonwealth PBS—and therefore taxpayers—is some $60 million. That figure does not take into account the benefit of the illegal patent monopoly that this company had since the first patent expired in July 2003, which has been estimated to have cost between $480 million and $600 million for one pharmaceutical item.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">So my question to the Department of Health and Ageing was: what have you done, what are you doing or what are you planning to do to collect at least the $60 million from the pharmaceutical company? At five per cent per annum on the debt, which has not been collected, it certainly starts to compound. I would also like to know what involvement the Department of Health and Ageing had in the patent litigation between Apotech and Sanofi-Aventis. I understand that any patent law suits must be served under IP Australia under the Patents Act. IP Australia has the right to be heard by the court. Would the department care to enlighten me in this chamber on what steps were taken to ensure that IP Australia intervened in these proceedings so as to protect Australian taxpayers from overpaying this pharmaceutical company? You may smile, Madam Acting Deputy President Fisher; this is a serious issue. We are talking about $600 million because of a slack patent law interpretation.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I also understand that one of many patent cases inviting what we might call evergreening is this one: that is to say patents over some pharmaceuticals renew the period of patent protection for so-called innovations that often amount to little more than a new cover around a pill or tinkering, as in the case of clenbuterol, which the High Court has rejected. It is hardly what you call inventive.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I would like to know what protection Australian taxpayers have against this sort of behaviour. In this debate we have the patients, the people locked away in those little rooms on six months wages, universities, people driven not by money but by vocation against lawyers, attorneys and bankers who are trying to avoid the question for the betterment of human health and the future of humans on the planet to an affordable access to health remedies by absolutely having the guts which this bill does not address. It does not address the fundamental problem of why we have allowed the patenting of discovery. We have allowed discovery through the broad interpretation of patent law to be included in the inventive side. Why can't we say, 'Sure, you've have got the gene there. You've twigged it. You've done something with it which is inventive, commercially useful and patentable, but let everyone have access to the original gene'? They say it is because you will reduce research; you will actually increase research, and no snarly, smiling legal advice can get around that. I seek leave to table these documents.</span>

                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">
                    <a href="8IV" type="MemberSpeech">
                      <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Senator XENOPHON</span>
                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">South Australia</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">21:10</span>):  I endorse the remarks of Senator Heffernan and I think we need to put this in perspective. Senator Heffernan indicated just one example: it did not cost taxpayers tens of millions of dollars but hundreds of millions of dollars. That is something that should be addressed in the government's response to the quite serious allegations that Senator Heffernan made in relation to how the patent system in this country is and has been abused. I think Senator Heffernan is right: you see a difference of opinion in the way that these matters ought to be dealt with in terms of our patent laws between the Department of Health and Ageing and IP Australia, which is of course part of the Department of Innovation, Industry, Science and Research and has portfolio responsibility for Australia's IP system. There is a huge gulf between the two. I have seen it in Senate inquiries on related matters to gene patenting. I am a co-sponsor of the bill, along with a number of other senators—coalition and Australian Greens senators and, without verballing Senator Madigan, I think he shares similar concerns in relation to this. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">These are important issues. I think it is widely agreed that Australia's patenting system is in need of an urgent overhaul. It could be argued that this bill takes the first steps towards that but does not go far enough. It does not deal with the fundamental issues that have been outlined by Senator Heffernan and additional issues that I will refer to shortly.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I support the government's intention of raising the standard of patents in Australia and I also support the provisions for the bill relating to research, but, again, I wonder whether it actually provides the protection that needs to be provided. Supporting Innovation Australia is vital. If we continue to fail to provide a research exemption in relation to patents, we face more and more companies taking their research work offshore. In particular, it hampers those medical researchers who for altruistic reasons are doing all they can to improve the lives of others through medical breakthroughs. They are tied up. Patents can tie them up in a way that is quite destructive that winds back the cause of genuine medical research. It fetters our science and innovation.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We need to take into account the remarks and tremendous work of Dr Luigi Palombi of the Australian National University Centre for Governance of Knowledge and Development in his submission to the Senate community affairs committee and its inquiry into gene patents. Dr Palombi made it very clear how gene patents negatively impact on the provision and cost of health care, progress and medical research, and the health and wellbeing of Australian people. We should heed his warning and legislate to ensure that genes cannot be patented as an invention. This will ensure that researchers are not impeded in medical research and that Australians are not denied access to healthcare treatments. My question to the parliamentary secretary in relation to this is: to what extent does the government consider that this bill would adequately deal with these issues so that medical research is not fettered, is not impeded, by the unfair use or abuse of patent laws? </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I believe that the government needs to consider this bill as only a first step in reforming Australia's patent system. The consultation process for this bill revealed major concerns within interest groups about how the current patent system operates. The general consensus seems to be that this bill is better than no reform at all, but without further reforms we run the risk of losing even more of our best and brightest overseas.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I would like to reflect on some of the concerns that have been outlined by Dr Palumbi. He acknowledges that there are aspects of this bill that are long overdue and positive. It is not all bad, but, really, it is just tinkering around the real problems. I share Dr Palumbi's concern that this bill may not make any real practical difference to how the Australian patent system works, which is currently pathetically poor. I agree with Dr Palumbi's concern about the way the Patents Act 1990 is written. It was drafted by IP Australia, with the help of senior patent attorneys and patent licensing executives from major corporations, so I wonder about issues of potential conflict within the patent system in terms of how the bill was structured.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">What are the matters that I think need to be addressed in any future bills? We ought to have all patent applications and granted patents define one single invention in the patent specification. That would be an important reform. Under the current legislation, the patent ability requirements in subsection 18(1) are that the presence of a patentable subject matter, novelty, an inventive step and utility are assessed against each and every claim. Again, I am borrowing directly from the concerns outlined by Dr Palumbi. His concern is that, if a patent has 50 claims, the patent examiners have to look at each and every claim. How much time should that take in order to do it properly? I am concerned that not enough time is being taken. The problem, as we know from IP staffers, is that they do not have the time, and the tendency for patent examiners is to allow the claim rather than to rigorously apply the rules. I do not blame the patent examiners, who I believe diligently do their very best to enforce the law, but they simply do not have the resources or the time to go through some of these applications properly.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The BRCA patents are a perfect example. What is it that Myriad Genetics invented? Was it the BRCA genetic mutations linked to breast cancer? Was it the genetic sequence of the BRCA genetic mutations? Was it the genetic test for BRCA gene mutations? Or was it something else? I agree with Dr Palumbi that by looking at one of the four BRCA patents you can see that they are apparently all related to one invention. I think there is an issue there. Every patent should define clearly and simply what it is that the inventor says the invention is. In the BRCA patent example, why did Myriad have four patents if the invention was a BRCA genetic test? Why did they have 30 claims alone in just the first of the four patents? And why did they include claims to BRCA genes and proteins if they did not invent them? These are the questions posed by Dr Palumbi and I believe they ought to be answered.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">There are other matters that need to be dealt with. The test should be that all patent ability thresholds are assessed against the one invention, as defined in the patent specification. This will save much time, as the patent examiners can then focus on that invention. That is a necessary and important reform. There ought to be antiavoidance provisions inserted in our patent laws. It is a bit like the tax act in that, if patent attorneys know that they are crossing the line, if they are overreaching in a way that stifles innovation or in a way that unfairly knocks out competition, then they could be subject to prosecution and fines at the very least. There needs to be a definition of patent abuse and it needs to be a crime to be involved in patent abuse. It is a controversial issue that has been raised by Dr Palumbi and I agree with him. If you hold back essential research when dealing with breast cancer, or any cancer, to me that is untenable. We need to have clear antiavoidance provisions. Patents are like taxes in reverse in that, unlike the tax act, in which the government gets the money, it is private individuals and companies who get the money. Without a patent abuse provision there is no disincentive not to game the system, and my fear is that the system is being gamed.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">There ought to be a meaningful objects clause in the Patents Act. There ought to be a meaningful damages provision that enables the Commonwealth or state governments and individuals who are negatively impacted on by a patent that is revoked to recoup the value of the patent monopoly or the damages caused by the patent monopoly. That is what a patent is: it is a monopoly sanctioned by law. It is the only circumstance where a monopoly is allowed by virtue of a patent. So if we are going to grant a monopoly we need to be very careful about the circumstances in which that monopoly is granted. I still remember that quote by Rupert Murdoch, who said, 'A monopoly is a terrible thing, unless you happen to have it.' I think that is something we need to bear in mind in the context of patent law. This is the only form of a sanctioned, legislated monopoly protected by statute that private individuals are allowed to have, and we must grant monopolies for patents very carefully. We must have antiavoidance provisions. We must have a provision to allow for damages following an abuse of that monopoly for those who have been damaged by that monopolistic abuse of this provision.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">These are just some of the issues that need to be dealt with. Again, I have borrowed heavily from the wise research and work of Dr Palumbi. We need to heed his concerns regarding the abuses occurring within our Patents Act. This piece of legislation is not unwelcome, but I believe it ought to have gone much further. I would like to think that this is the beginning of further reforms. We should note the tension between the Department of Health and Ageing and IP Australia. The department of health understands what the cost will be to the public health system unless we address these issues comprehensively and unless we comprehensively tackle the issue of abuse of the patent system. I think it was Senator Madigan who helpfully mentioned that we need to look at the cost to people. The cost to people could actually be their lives if we hold back unnecessary research and the cost of essential life-saving medication is much higher than it ought to be because of abuses in the patents system. I commend the work of Minister Carr in relation to this, but I believe we need to go further. I fear that, unless the warnings of Dr Palumbi and others are heeded, unnecessary abuses of our patent laws will continue to lead to adverse outcomes for the Australian people.</span>

                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">
                    <a href="KO6" type="MemberSpeech">
                      <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Senator HUMPHRIES</span>
                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Australian Capital Territory</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">21:23</span>):  I want to make a brief contribution to this debate. I participated in the Senate community affairs committee inquiry into the private member's legislation that proposed to deal with the way in which patents relating to genetic material are dealt with. I think all the participants in that inquiry—and it was a very substantial inquiry—came away with somewhat more knowledge of the patents laws of Australia than perhaps they really wanted to have. But it did demonstrate very amply, I think, to those who participated in the inquiry that intellectual property laws in Australia are creaking and groaning, are in need of overhaul, have not kept up with the changing way in which technology is impacting on the process of industrial manufacture and invention and that there needs to be a revision of some of the concepts within our legislation.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Many pointers to those findings were available to the committee, particularly things like the report of the Advisory Council on Intellectual Property and at least one report by the Australian Law Reform Commission. The fact that it had been quite some time since these reports had been tabled—in the case of the ALRC report, at least—suggested not only that these were important and complex issues but also that the difficulties associated with understanding the implications of the changes recommended had caused some lack of movement on the part of those in government who are responsible for progressing the sorts of reforms which have been identified.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">So the legislation that we see before us today has been brought forward. I welcome this legislation. Although, as other senators have said, it does not solve the sorts of problems I have just referred to with respect to Australia's intellectual property laws, particularly its patent laws, there are welcome steps forward in this legislation and it does deserve the attention which the Senate now gives it to ensure that issues such as research are addressed in a more contemporary way than is evident in the existing legislation.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I particularly welcome the provisions relating to research. There is claimed to be uncertainty about the scope of protection at common law for those who seek to use existing patent material or patents as the basis for their ongoing research. The fear that a person might conduct research, make a significant finding and then find that they are unable to use that discovery because they have infringed someone else's patents is alleged to be a significant barrier towards proper research in Australian companies and, in particular, not-for-profit organisation such as universities and research institutes. The evidence of that barrier to research is not as plentiful as some have suggested. But I suggest that some clarification of what a person may do when they are conducting research in an area where patents already exist does need to occur. As such, the step forward in this legislation is important.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This bill provides an exemption for activities undertaken solely for the purpose of gaining regulatory approval to market or manufacture a patented technology. The effect of this expands the existing exemption for pharmaceutical inventions to all technologies. That provides a measure of certainty, which is important, and I welcome that very much.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">There is more precision required from patent applications than has been the case in the past. Senator Xenophon made reference to the ambit claim approach which so many patent applications appear to have made in the past—and, I think, fairly did make in the past. This legislation appropriately limits the scope of that and requires more to be demonstrated by the patent applicant than has been the case in the past.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I think it also needs to be recorded, however, that Australia's intellectual property laws do not operate as an invention of the Australian legal system. Our intellectual property laws are very much a reflection of international property regimes around the whole world—and we depart from those norms at our peril. We have to acknowledge that most of the companies around the world that use patents to bring products to market—products which are efficacious to health, agricultural production, manufacturing and all sorts of other purposes—will generally want to own patents in every country where their products might be produced or sold. If the regime applying in Australia is dramatically different from the regimes applying elsewhere, it is hard to do that, and Australians might miss out because we do not share the common approach, broadly speaking, of other countries in the world.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I do not want to use this debate to rehearse the many arguments that took place in the community affairs committee about the patenting of genetic material. I would simply say that some clarification of the law needs to occur. It is provided for here, at least in part. I want to associate myself very much with Senator Colbeck's remarks that further work needs to be done and the concerns of a number of parties who submitted to the examination of this legislation that it has not been addressed fully and does need to be addressed. I look forward to this legislation being an important first step in getting a better state, a better functioning intellectual property system, than Australia currently enjoys.</span>

                      <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Senator CARR</span>
                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Victoria</span>—<span class="HPS-MinisterialTitles">Minister for Manufacturing and Minister for Defence Materiel</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">21:30</span>):  I thank the senators for their contribution to this debate. As I understand it, there is broad support in the chamber for this bill and I thank senators for that. Let me take this opportunity, in response, to try to answer some of the questions that have been raised. My understanding is that Senator Heffernan and Senator Xenophon have raised the case involving Sanofi-Aventis, where the High Court invalidated a patent. As I understand this particular case, or the suggestion has been made— </span>

                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">

                      <span class="HPS-MemberInterjecting">Senator Xenophon:</span>
                    </a>  That was Senator Heffernan, I think.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">
                    <a href="AW5" type="MemberContinuation">
                      <span class="HPS-MemberContinuation">Senator CARR:</span>
                    </a>  You did not raise it? I see. My understanding then is that Senator Heffernan raised the issue about an undertaking to compensate the Commonwealth in regard to the court's actions in invalidating a patent. It has been suggested that money was lost to the PBS system because of the extended patent but it has not been repaid to the Commonwealth. The officers who are here tonight do not have the detail of that matter. It is the responsibility of the health department, as I understand it. The officers will take the questions on notice and provide further information to Senator Heffernan.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">There have been a number of issues raised by the stakeholders. Senator Colbeck, I am sure you would appreciate this point. The bill is one that the community values and wants passed. I support the point that Senator Boyce made on the importance of the IP system. These are changes that have been under negotiation through a very broad range of consultations since 2009. It is a project that I had the opportunity to work on with the community to ensure significant advances to the IP system as a result of consultations. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I believe the effect of the three separate rounds of discussions over the past two years have seen innovators, researchers, small businesses, large corporations, lawyers, and patent and trademark attorneys make very useful contributions. The bill before the chamber is now a much better piece of legislation. A strong intellectual property system is critical to our capacity to drive innovation and research in this country. It directly benefits Australians. A robust patent system ensures that we have a proper system to protect intellectual property, but the administrative arrangements are undertaken in such a way as to not clog up the system. It allows proper competition in regard to the development of new ideas and better inventions.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This bill provides us with an opportunity to align standards with our major trading partners, to modernise the system. It allows us to be more competitive for Australian inventors, so they do not have to take their work overseas. It provides clarity, it provides certainty for our researchers and it means that if there is any suggestion—and the argument has been put that it is not presented with great evidence to sustain it—that litigation might be used as an impediment to research then that will be removed as a result of this legislation.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This bill when enacted will speed up the process of resolving patent and trademark applications. It will provide applications and the public with much better opportunities to ensure that they have the protections of patent law. The law helps IP professionals to assist those who seek to take advantage of the patent system. It makes it easier for them to secure a patent, but not for trivial things. It provides a much stronger quality of advice by making it easier to ensure that we can secure the necessary legal protections for people. It protects people from imitations and fakes. It provides better border protection systems and stronger sanctions against counterfeits.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Finally, the bill simplifies the more technical aspects of the current IP system so that innovators can spend less time prosecuting applications and more time innovating. That is why the bill is so named: raising the bar. It raises the quality of the innovation system to raise the quality of innovation and to benefit all Australians. That is why I argue we ought to support this bill and we ought to give it rapid passage.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">

                      <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Senator BRANDIS</span>
                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Queensland</span>—<span class="HPS-MinisterialTitles">Deputy Leader of the Opposition in the Senate</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">21:37</span>):  The opposition supports the Extradition and Mutual Assistance in Criminal Matters Legislation Amendment Bill 2011. Because it is increasingly common for criminal activity to have a transnational component, the coalition believes it is essential that Australia provides and seeks international cooperation in ensuring that criminals are not able to evade justice simply by crossing borders. This requires a working extradition regime that includes appropriate safeguards.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Australia's extradition relationships with other countries ensure the effective administration of criminal justice here in this country. They also allow us to cooperate with other countries to fight crime and prevent Australia from becoming a safe haven for people who have been accused of serious crimes in other countries. Our national interest also requires that criminals cannot evade investigation, prosecution and asset confiscation simply because the evidence or proceeds of their crimes are in different countries. The coalition strongly believes this requires a responsive mutual assistance system to combat domestic and transnational crime with, again, appropriate safeguards built into the system.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">It is important to recall that extradition does not arise as an obligation under international law. Rather, it is a favour accorded by one country to another. Extradition obligations between countries therefore arise principally from reciprocal treaty arrangements between states. The extradition treaties to which Australia is party are given effect by the Extradition Act. Mutual assistance is a different process directed towards a different outcome: it is directed towards the provision of formal government-to-government assistance in criminal investigations and prosecutions rather than the surrender of individuals between jurisdictions. Mutual assistance is also used to recover the proceeds of crime, which is integral to the fight against serious and organised crime.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Although a number of treaties exist between Australia and other countries for mutual assistance in criminal matters, the Mutual Assistance Act does not depend on the existence of a treaty with the relevant overseas country. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The current laws relating to extradition and mutual assistance in criminal matters were passed more than 20 years ago. A number of reviews of the legislation have been undertaken in the meantime, including a 2001 Joint Standing Committee on Treaties report, a government review in 2006, and more recently, discussion papers on both acts in 2009 and again in January 2011. As we all know, there have been significant changes in the nature and scale of global crime since that time, attributable to globalisation and changes in technology.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The Australian Federal Police have expressed concerns that the legislation, as it stands, has not kept pace with the advancements in technology—including the pervasiveness of technology—as it exists today. In a public hearing held by the House of Representatives Standing Committee on Social Policy and Legal Affairs the AFP expressed its concern about the fact that it is now possible to make telephone calls that do not go through Australian exchanges and it is possible to store data on devices and servers that are not in our jurisdiction. The AFP argued that this issue needs to be addressed in order to maintain the fight against organised crime and protect national security. The coalition strongly supports giving the AFP the tools it needs, subject to appropriate safeguards, to protect Australia's national security and wage war against transnational crime.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This bill amends the following features of the extradition and mutual assistance regimes. Firstly, it expands the existing grounds for refusing an extradition request, to include punishment or discrimination on the basis of a person's sex or sexual orientation. Secondly, similarly, it expands the existing grounds for refusing a mutual assistance request to include discrimination on the basis of a person's sexual orientation. Thirdly, it extends of the availability of bail in extradition proceedings, so that bail may be granted where a person has consented to extradition, and permits applications for bail in the later stages of the extradition process. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Fourthly, the bill widens the circumstances in which a person may be prosecuted in Australia in lieu of extradition. Currently, this only applies where extradition is refused on the basis that the person is an Australian citizen. Under the proposed amendments, a person may be prosecuted in Australia in any circumstances where Australia has refused extradition, and thus ensures that a refusal to extradite will not entail an escape from justice.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Fifthly, the bill incorporates an express prohibition on providing mutual assistance where the provision of that assistance may expose a person to torture, and provides guidance on assessing the risk of torture in extradition determinations, consistent with the UN convention. Sixthly, it expands the death-penalty grounds for refusal in mutual assistance requests to cover situations where a suspect has been arrested and detained but not formally charged. Finally, it expands the grounds for refusal to cover mutual assis­tance requests which relate to all stages of the investigation, prosecution and sentencing of a person. The coalition supports all of those amendments.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The Greens have circulated amendments to this bill, which the coalition does not support. I do, however, wish to make some remarks in relation to the proposed Greens amendments on the bail provisions. As a general principle, the coalition agrees that there should be a presumption in favour of bail in criminal proceedings. However, this presumption does not apply in extradition proceedings and is available only where special circumstances exist.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The status quo on the presumption against bail is appropriate in extradition matters because there are significant risks in granting bail to people suspected of serious criminal offences who have fled a jurisdiction in an attempt to evade justice. The Senate will be aware of the recent case of accused Serbian war criminal Dragan Vasiljkovic—also known as Daniel Snedden—who disappeared from the High Court in Canberra just one day before it ruled against him in an extradition request from Croatia. The result was a 43-day manhunt, involving a team of up to 40 police and a four-day covert surveillance operation by the Australian Federal Police, which eventually led to his arrest. The coalition agrees with the position of the Attorney-General's Department, which states that:</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">The current presumption against bail for persons sought for extradition is appropriate given the serious flight risk posed by the person in extradition matters, and Australia's international obligations to secure the return of alleged offenders to face justice in the requesting country. The High Court in United Mexican States v Cabal had previously observed that to grant bail where a risk of flight exists would jeopardise Australia's relationship with the country seeking extradition and jeopardise our standing in the international community.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Evidence given to the Joint Standing Committee on Treaties during its inquiry indicated that the presumption against bail was included in the legislation on the basis that 'there was a very high risk of a person escaping, particularly since in many cases the person had fled the jurisdiction for Australia to evade justice'. Other countries, such as the United States, also uphold the presumption against bail, only allowing suspected criminals to be granted bail in special circumstances.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">In summary, the coalition supports measures to ensure Australia is not seen as a safe haven for criminals and the profits of their crimes or indeed is not in fact a safe haven for criminals and the profits of their crimes. We also support measures that contribute to improving Australia's international crime cooperation legislation. For those reasons, the coalition supports the bill.</span>

                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">
                    <a href="200287" type="MemberSpeech">
                      <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Senator WRIGHT</span>
                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">South Australia</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">21:46</span>):  I rise to speak on the Extradition and Mutual Assistance in Criminal Matters Legislation Amendment Bill 2011. The bill proposes a number of significant reforms to streamline and modernise Australia's laws on extradition and mutual assistance. It is the first major reform to these laws in over 20 years. There is no doubt that in this time the landscape within which international crime occurs has changed considerably. Over the last 20 years we have seen massive advances in technology, communications and travel, and criminal networks have adapted accordingly.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Our law enforcement agencies must be adequately equipped to effectively combat crime in this new era. Certainly the Australian Greens do not dispute that law reform in this area is warranted. However, I wish to place on the record some considerable concerns that I, as legal affairs spokesperson for the Australian Greens, have about certain aspects of the bill and to explain why we feel it is necessary to move the five groups of amendments that we will be moving when the debate resumes. Despite the imperative to act effectively and decisively against international crime, Australia must also ensure that our justice system at all times respects and safeguards the democratic freedoms and human rights of those it affects.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">There are significant social and economic costs of crime, but we must be vigilant that in responding we do not unduly encroach on hard won and painstakingly developed fundamental legal principles or erode well-recognised universal human rights, which are the hallmark of fair and civilised societies. As everyone here would agree, we need to strike the right balance. The issue exercising my mind has been whether indeed the right balance has been struck in this bill. It is the hard but essential work of this parliament to confront difficult issues such as how best to combat international crime without eroding the principles of the rule of law in Australia. In the laws that it makes, this parliament must fully discharge our international human rights obligations both at home and abroad. In so doing we help to protect our own citizens against arbitrary and unfair action and extend that approach to citizens in the rest of the world.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I recognise that this bill seeks to streamline and modernise Australia's laws on extradition and mutual assistance while maintaining appropriate human rights safeguards. I recognise that in a number of cases the bill introduces important new safeguards to the existing extradition and mutual assistance regimes. But on close consideration the Australian Greens cannot sit back and say that the right balance has been struck. In saying that I do wish to acknowledge the extensive consultation undertaken by the government with respect to this bill. I also recognise that significant changes were made to the bill as a result of that consultation process. However, through the consultation process, dating back to 2006 when discussion papers canvassing these reforms were first released, serious reservations have been expressed by a number of Australia's peak legal and human rights bodies about a range of matters associated with this bill, some of which have not been addressed by the government. These bodies include the Law Council of Australia, the Australian Human Rights Commission, the Australian Lawyers Alliance and the Human Rights Law Centre.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">
                  <a href="7G6" type="MemberSpeech">
                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Senator LUNDY</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Australian Capital Territory</span>—<span class="HPS-MinisterialTitles">Parliamentary Secretary to the Prime Minister and Parliamentary Secretary for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">21:50</span>):  Over the last several years Australia's national capital city has recognised and celebrated a series of centenary moments as we work our way towards the climax of activity on the big birthday, 12 March 2013. Notable highlights of this commemorative suite so far have included the battle of the sites, when in the first instance cities and towns right across the continent and later courtesy of section 125 of the Constitution across the state of New South Wales pushed their optimistic claims to host the capital city.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The option originally called Yass-Canberra would ultimately carry the day and in late 1908 it was a very close-run thing and hotly contested. With the elegant Monaro Plains region thus secured for the new national city, it was time for the surveyors to embark on their vital work. So it was Charles Scrivener and the many talented men he hired for the Commonwealth who did their bit, marking out the city as we know it today. Perhaps the far more exhausting and challenging work for them was mastering the many ups and downs of a full five-year border survey which took them to the heights of the southern alps. In 2009 and 2010 we rightly recalled those original surveyors for their skill, resilience and the sheer quality of their work, which would enable the Federal Capital Territory to be established on 1 January 1911. The first ordinance of the new Federal Capital Territory was announced by the Minister for Home Affairs of the day, the colourful Labor Party personality King O'Malley. That first ordinance was in fact the introduction of prohibition. It is hard to imagine a dry capital, but that is definitely a story for another day. In 2011, the major centenary was getting ever closer and we were all beginning to appreciate the extraordinary achievements and milestones of that first federal government since Federation to have a majority in both houses of parliament, from 1910 to 1913. It was 100 years ago that the majority Labor government of the impressive Andrew Fisher was, over its full three-year term, able to pursue an ambitious nation-building policy agenda.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The country was finally put on a stable political, social, economic and cultural footing as Prime Minister Fisher and his team of committed ministers firmly prioritised national infrastructure. I would like to cite two Fisher government initiatives that had their centenary last year. In June 1911, the Royal Military College at Duntroon was established. Duntroon cadets were actively involved in the earliest AIF conflicts, including Gallipoli, and they participated with distinction, as did the college's first commandant, Brigadier General William Throsby Bridges. Bridges was shot by a sniper near Anzac Cove on the morning of 15 May 1915, only weeks into the campaign. He died on 18 May, and his body was controversially returned to Australia for eventual burial on Mount Pleasant, in a Walter Burley Griffin designed grave site, overlooking the college that he helped to found. Duntroon's establishment just over a century ago was a defining moment in Australian military history.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Perhaps much less well known, but of seminal cultural importance for the new nation and the new national capital, was the establishment by the Fisher government of the Historic Memorials Committee, which was immediately tasked with establishing a historic memorials collection. As Kylie Scroope, the Director of Art Services in the Department of Parliamentary Services, noted in her Senate occasional lecture late last year:</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Small">This invaluable collection also set in place the foundations for other important collecting institutions, such as the National Gallery of Australia and the National Portrait Gallery.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">It was entirely appropriate that these early symbolic foundation stones of our nation's broad and diverse cultural fabric should be erected under the careful watch of Labor's third government since Federation.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">But the reformist government did much more for the fledgling nation. Prime Minister Fisher personally oversaw the redesign of the Australian coat of arms, confirming the genuinely Australian emblem we have such great affection for today. He shepherded through the parliament the purchase by the Commonwealth of the massive 16,500 item collection of Edward Augustus Petherick—what Fisher called a national heirloom, with its impressive array of books, newspapers, photographs and ephemera. He made sure that Australian stamps shrugged off the dated monarchist icons in favour of images distinctively Australian, particularly the kangaroo.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Fortunately, in the midst of all of this prodigious output, the Fisher government, under the watchful eye of home affairs minister Mr O'Malley, recognised that it was time that a national government took concrete steps to honour the Federation founders' commitment to create an inland purpose-built capital city. The result was an international design competition that quite simply captured the imagination of the world—and this from a nation not even a dozen years old. The competition—its winners and the stunning entries, from winner and place-getters and a number of the unplaced—all demand to be richly celebrated as we near the exact centenary of the announcement of the prize winners on 23 May 2012.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The internationally renowned Finish architect Eliel Saarinen came second, and the French architect planner Alfred Agache—who would in time produce the plan for the Rio de Janeiro we know today—came third. But, of the 137 announced entries, the deserving winner was the Chicago architect, Walter Burley Griffin, who, with his wife and professional partner, Marion Mahony, formed an irresistible creative team.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">There is no doubt in my mind that the Griffin entry, with its 16 large and radiant panels now carefully preserved in the National Archives of Australia, comprises one of Australia's most treasured artistic collections. Equally, there is no doubt in my mind that Australians will, as the 21st century unfolds, come to properly appreciate and honour the visionary design, the futuristic design, the city truly in the landscape, selected in that original competition.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Minister O'Malley famously declared at the time:</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Small">I am satisfied the best design has been selected. It is a wonderful design and shall make the federal capital [of Australia] the finest in the world … what we wanted was the best the world can give us and we have got it.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Griffin was certain of what he and Marion had gifted to Australia. In perhaps the most often quoted utterance in Canberra's design history books he wrote:</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Small">I have planned a city not like any other city in the world. I have planned it not in a way that I expected any governmental authorities in the world would accept. I have planned an ideal city—a city that meets my ideal of the city of the future.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">So, in this the centenary year of that landmark competition, I ask all of my parliamentary colleagues to spare a bit of time to familiarise themselves with one of their nation capital's most engaging moments, when the Griffin's entry, No. 29, was showcased around the world, one century ago.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">One of life's most enjoyable experiences as an ACT senator is to take overseas visitors to the top of Mount Ainslie to see the outline of that indelible Griffin landscape design for themselves. Once they see it, they get it; they understand the significance of the capital, the 'city in the landscape', beautifully spread out before them, with its compelling geometry, at one with the natural landforms.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">It is a precious legacy. The Griffin's then radical concept of the living city is the city of the future. Through Canberra's centenary years, as parliamentarians we all share the responsibility to inform ourselves as proactive custodians of this unique history of our beautiful national capital.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">
                  <a href="YW4" type="MemberSpeech">
                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Senator IAN MACDONALD</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Queensland</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">21:59</span>):  I noticed during the break that Senator Brown and the Australian Greens had been waxing lyrical yet again in the media, this time wanting the government to legislate to regulate newspapers to control content and ownership—shades, I might say, of totalitarian regimes of the 20th century. So tonight I want to return to an issue related to the so-called independent media inquiry which is currently being conducted at the behest of the Australian Greens party, primarily as a payback to News Limited for its scrutiny of Senator Brown and his party—a scrutiny which, I might say, has exposed the Greens party for its hypocrisy and the contradictions between its policies and its rhetoric.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Senators may recall that late last year I drew attention to Senator Brown's advocacy to this inquiry of tax deductibility for not-for-profit journalism enterprises. In particular, I drew attention to the fact that this policy would benefit the Greens' major donor, Mr Graeme Wood, with whom Senator Brown negotiated the largest donation in Australia's political history and who is now backing former ABC reporter Monica Attard in a new 'independent' journalism enterprise, The Global Mail, to the tune of $3 million a year for five years. The Global Mail, senators might recall, was launched earlier this month. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Senators may also recall that I called upon Senator Brown to say whether or not he has had any discussions with Mr Graeme Wood about the need for such a journalism venture and/or the need for such ventures to receive tax deductibility status and to say what, if anything, he knew of the genesis of the letter to him from six academics advocating just such a policy—whether it was something out of the blue or whether Senator Brown had had any discussions about it and, if so, with whom. According to Crikey, which broke the story of Graeme Wood's support for The Global Mail, Mr Wood said, 'He's happy to cop ongoing businesses losses,' and also, 'I think eventually there will be a financial business model for this sort of thing, but it ain't there yet.' </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">In an interview with the ABC in July last year, Monica Attard said, 'I have a generous philanthropist in Graeme Wood, who is prepared to fund us into the foreseeable future whilst we attempt to forge a new model of journalism and perhaps even a new business model somewhere down the track.' At the time I thought to myself, 'What could Graeme Wood and Monica Attard mean by this talk of "new business models"'? We now have some idea and—surprise, surprise—it seems that The Global Mail's business model is that it should get tax-deductibility status, the status advocated by Senator Brown to the independent media inquiry.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">In October last year, The Global Mail made a submission to the media inquiry which, in a section entitled 'How governments can help', urged the government to make donations to such ventures tax deductible by giving them deductible gift recipient status with concomitant fringe benefits tax and GST concessions. In addition, The Global Mail puts in bids for government subvention by way of direct funding, compensation and seed funding, as well as asking for relief from state based payroll taxes. Why is it that whenever the Greens and the Left talk about business models, what they are really talking about and what they really mean is taxpayer handouts?</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Monica Attard concluded her submission to the inquiry by saying: 'This is not an exhaustive wish list. It is, however, a means by which government might assist in supporting media ventures aimed at producing high-quality, non-partisan journalism.' We will wait to see how non-partisan The Global Mail turns out to be. I would have my guesses, but it will have to guard against just being a more sophisticated Green Left media outfit dressing up a left-wing agenda in the guise of public interest—all the while wanting taxpayers to underwrite its operations.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">In the meantime, Senator Brown—as all senators know—still has a lot of explaining to do about how he came to advocate a measure which would provide a tax windfall to his party's biggest donor to the tune of a million or more dollars a year. Senators will be aware that the Privileges Committee is currently investigating whether or not Senator Brown acted corruptly in using Senate or other fora to repeatedly push Mr Wood's commercial interest to secure the Triabunna woodchip mill for future property development and also to damage the interest of his competitors. The question arises as to whether anything untoward has occurred on this occasion.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">As well as calling Senator Brown to come clean, I would ask Senator Rhiannon—who is known to hold certain views on political donations, particularly from property developers—to encourage her leader, Senator Brown, to say whether or not he discussed with Mr Wood the desirability of a journalism venture like The Global Mail or the desirability of such a venture receiving tax deductibility status.</span>

                    <span class="HPS-MemberContinuation">Senator WATERS:</span>
                  </a>  You just did interrupt me, Senator Macdonald. I rise to speak about the Rural and Regional Affairs and Transport Legislation Committee's report, which was tabled earlier today, into my bill—the Environment Protection and Biodiversity Conservation Amendment (Protecting Australia's Water Resources) Bill 2011—the aim of which is to better protect water from the ravages of the mining and coal seam gas industries. It is with great shame and disappointment that the committee has recommended that the bill not be passed. Once again, we see both of the old parties colluding to make sure that the federal government takes no responsibility whatsoever for acting on coal seam gas and protecting our precious and ancient water resources from coal seam gas and other mining.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">My bill proposes to improve and increase the environment minister's power to better protect water. What environment minister or government would not want the power to protect water from various impacts? It is lost on me. Surely, in the driest inhabited continent on earth, water should be treated as a national resource. I genuinely do not understand why the federal government still thinks that it is not their business to properly protect our national water resources, particularly given that the states have demonstrated time and time again that they are failing to protect our farmland, our rural communities and our environment from the risks of the rampant coal seam gas industry.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">You only need to look at the example of the contamination in 2009 of the Springbok aquifer—in my home state of Queensland, on our beautiful Darling Downs, our best food-producing land—from fracking to know that fracking is not safe. Why is the federal government still doing nothing about that? The examples continue. Following the terrible floods in Queensland just over a year ago, we saw massive pollution of our rivers from both mining pits and coal seam gas evaporation ponds. There was massive environmental damage, and still the feds do nothing. Most recently, we saw a terrible spill in the Pilliga State Forest of New South Wales caused by a dodgy—if I may use that word—previous operator. Again, the feds still think that the states are doing a fine job and that the feds should not be bothered to do anything about it. I, and in fact 67 per cent of Queenslanders, beg to differ. A poll last week showed that that percentage of Queenslanders do not support coal seam gas and that they are rightly worried about our lack of knowledge about the long-term impacts of this industry.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I now turn to addressing some of the complaints about the bill made by the committee in its report and to talk about why I think the bill is an excellent idea. First of all, our surface and groundwater systems are ancient. We do not properly understand how they are connected and we certainly do not understand the impacts that coal seam gas and other mining is having on them now and may have on them in the long term. There are big threats to our water, our land and our environment. There is an incredible level of uncertainty. National bodies like the CSIRO and the National Water Commission gave evidence in the inquiry into the bill, and they have put out various public statements saying, 'We do not understand the long-term impacts of coal seam gas on our water, and we do not understand enough about the hydrological connectivity of our groundwater and surface water systems to know whether or not fracking and other aspects of coal seam gas are safe.' These are big warning bells being sounded by our most informed expert bodies. You would think that the government would listen to those expert bodies—certainly they should.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">A number of charges have been levelled at the bill, and I will address the key ones. Once again there is a tendency to say, 'The states have this all covered; it's not a problem—go back to sleep everybody.' Unfortunately, the states are not managing this risk properly. I cited some of the examples of where state regulation has not protected our water resources and our rural communities. CSIRO, as I said, has highlighted the uncertainties about coal seam gas. In their evidence to the committee they stated:</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Small">As it is a relatively new industry, whilst the processes are understood, it takes some time to understand the properties associated with any hydrogeological setting … In a situation where you have done extraction for a limited amount of time, you are working with less information and the uncertainties are higher.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">That is the first reason that the federal government should be involved in properly protecting our water resources—we simply do not have enough information. It is not okay for the feds to say, 'Because we don't know what we don't know, we're not going to do anything.' That is a really flimsy excuse. The second point—you have heard me say this before, Mr President, and I am sure I will have the opportunity to say this many more times in this chamber, unfortunately—is that there are serious gaps and shortcomings in the states' and territories' regulation of this matter. We heard a lot of evidence in the hearing into this bill from various experts, in fact we heard from a body of national lawyers as well as some conservation activists, about the various loopholes in state laws. They demonstrated—very amply, I thought—that the states are simply not doing their job of protecting the environment and protecting our water resources.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I express in particular my disappointment at the position of the National Farmers Federation. They did not back the bill because they were concerned that at some point in the future another bill might come in which would somehow regulate agricultural water use. This bill does not do that. It is squarely confined to regulating the impacts of mining on water—and, of course, mining includes coal seam gas in the definitions. So I found it a little disappointing that the Farmers Federation were, I think, acting against the interests of their members in recommending that the bill not proceed. In fact, many farmers have told me that they do want the federal government to play a better role to protect water and that my bill is in fact precisely the means of doing that. So I have a bit of a bone to pick there with the National Farmers Federation.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I turn now to the assertion the committee makes that somehow the federal government's most recent announcements are adequate in this space. I wish they were. A number of announcements have been made. First of all, there is a proposal for national harmonised regulation for coal seam gas through COAG. That is all well and good provided you are not harmonising to the lowest common denominator. The Greens will be watching with great scrutiny to make sure they are not harmonising to the lowest common denominator. Unfortunately, we will probably be watching for a very long time. As everyone knows, COAG processes are notoriously slow, and that is another major concern. The coal seam gas industry is absolutely barrelling ahead, yet the government is saying, 'Never you mind; COAG will deal with it.' But don't hold your breath people; it is going to take too long, and we are going to see devastating impacts in the meantime. I do not think that the slowness of COAG's processes is a valid excuse for doing nothing.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The other assertion that the committee adopts as to why we do not need this bill is that the agreement the Prime Minister reached with Tony Windsor MP to establish an independent expert scientific panel is, again, going to somehow solve all our problems. We think that this panel is a really good idea and that it is a great first step. We support the fact that they are going to be providing advice to government, and we support the fact that they will be doing bioregional assessments of priority areas. I am interested to see how those areas are chosen. No doubt they will be in marginal seats. Be that as it may, we think it is a great first step. But the problem is that that panel will not be able to advise the federal government. The panel will simply be advising the states; the federal government does not have the power to look at these water impacts, because my bill has not yet been passed. That is the very point. It is all well and good to say, 'Let's provide science based decision making'—and we completely support that—but this is just another pretext for the federal government to wash its hands of properly protecting our water resources. I am afraid that I do not think anyone is going to be fooled.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I finish by pointing out that, despite the committee's report that the bill is unnecessary and duplicative, a water trigger is in fact what the Prime Minister herself proposed in the event that this COAG agreement does not come off. I found it somewhat perplexing that the report found the bill was unnecessary when it is indeed a foreshadowed policy outcome of the Prime Minister's own undertaking in the event that those COAG processes do not come to fruition.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I look forward to the debate on this bill when it comes before this chamber. The Greens have long been advocates for strong national protection for our water resources, which do not respect state borders. The states are not doing a good job of protecting our water, and they are unfortunately selling out our rural communities to turn a buck from the mining industry. The Greens will continue to advocate for better and stronger federal protection for our water resources.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">
                  <a href="2L6" type="MemberSpeech">
                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Senator MARK BISHOP</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Western Australia</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">22:23</span>):  In November last year I spoke on the subject of procurement, with an emphasis on skill shortages and training. I spoke of the competing demands for skilled workers coming from the mining industry. I also expressed concern at the apparent lack of effort on high-tech engineering, especially in systems engineering and integration. These are areas of extreme importance in the new era of defence capability, development and maintenance—areas to which so much funding is being allocated by the Commonwealth government. In this I was stimulated by some worthwhile submissions to the Senate Foreign Affairs Committee inquiry by several submitters—namely, the Association of Professional Engineers, Scientists and Managers of Australia and the Defence Systems Innovation Centre, located at the University of South Australia and clearly in that state. I set out the current skills development initiatives in defence and in industry, expressing quite significant misgivings about their adequacy.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I was therefore pleased to see the release of the initial Defence Industry Workforce discussion paper issued by Skills Australia. This paper was released by the minister only a couple of weeks ago, on 1 February this year. The task force behind the report is comprised of a complete raft of government agencies. Defence industry representatives were also on board. In this I hoped to see a thorough professional assessment of the scope of the task. However, I must say at the outset that I am a little disappointed at that publication.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">If its purpose was and is to quote 'stimulate discussion and debate', it is far too general, simply because the picture it paints is very incomplete. In fact, given the strength of membership from industry generally, as well as a senior officer from Defence, I wonder whether any of them had any serious input at all. Indeed, given the strategic importance of this task, I wonder why Defence, with DMO itself, has not done this work already. It is, after all, a fundamental plank of any industry policy. In short, the paper adds little to our knowledge.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Let me summarise what I think is needed from this task force if it is to be treated seriously and have serious input. First, on the demand side we need an accurate assessment of the implications of the current capability plan for both design and production. The same is needed for materiel in service—that is, the context in which this problem of skill shortages is to be considered. You need to look at the scope and nature of the industry task in a total defence framework. That should include an assessment of the technology with respect to its sophistication for each of the three services. I expect this has already been done. It should include the maintenance task, none of which should be a surprise to industry—they, of course, having many multibillion-dollar contracts going over decades and decades. After all, the capability plan, while huge, should be sufficiently well known and understood by industry.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Industry would be only too aware of their own internal skills needs, one presumes. In assessing this demand, the task force also needs to more finely delineate between the skills needed—for example, trades skills, project management skills, and the higher level graduate and post graduate qualifications needed. Specifically, we need to see greater specificity with respect to those skills, reflecting the high degree of specialisation necessary from basic trades through to the most difficult systems integration tasks. To that end, I suggest the generality of the descriptors used in the discussion paper are not very indicative at all of the range of skills needed.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The discussion paper correctly identifies the competition on the demand side. However, I suggest the assessments significantly underestimate its strength, especially from the mining and support industries sectors. I refer again to the work of Port Jackson and Partners issued by the ANZ Bank last August. I would suggest in line with that report, recognition needs to be given on the supply side for significant new and re-training programs. They will be needed to cope with rapidly changing nature of the workforce driven by economic restructuring already seriously underway.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We know that the manufacturing industry in this country is already under pressure, especially in the case where it is competing with cheaper imports against a very strong dollar—and I would suggest a dollar this is going to both remain high and go higher over the next 10 to 15 years.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">On the supply side, I accept the reservation that industry has expressed that continuity of work poses for stability of investment. It is particularly the case within their manufacturing workforce. Over the next 30 years the defence procurement budget is set at almost $300 billion. There is high-level technical input and therefore considerable reliance on reach back to overseas company headquarters where R&amp;D is usually concentrated. I seek leave to continue my remarks.</span>

                  </a>  The Minister for Immigration and Citizenship has provided the following answer to the honourable senator's question:</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Small">(1) Section 252 of the <span style="font-style:italic;">Migration Act 1958</span> provides detention service provider staff and officers of the Department of Immigration and Citizenship the powers to search clients for weapons. This includes powers to search clothing and property. In addition, there are a number of measures and procedures in place to prevent contraband or weapons from being brought into immigration detention facilities. These ensure the department is able to meet its obligations with regard to maintaining the good order of its detention facilities. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Small">There are a range of items that are either not permitted or are controlled in detention facilities, such as weapons, illicit drugs and associated paraphernalia, alcohol, flammable sprays, liquids and solids, sharp items, pornographic or offensive material, mobile phones with visual and audio recording devices, and other visual and audio recording devices. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Small">All clients and their property are screened before entering immigration detention facilities. Screening may include a client walking through screening equipment, or the passing of hand-held screening equipment over or around the client and the client's possessions, or passing the client's possessions through screening equipment. Any controlled items are stored securely with the client's property and cannot be accessed by the client. All controlled items are returned to the client when the person leaves immigration detention. Illegal items are secured and referred to the police. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Small">All mail to people in immigration detention is screened and any item that is regarded as suspicious is opened in the presence of the client. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Small">All staff and visitors entering immigration detention facilities are screened via x-ray facilities. Items brought into detention facilities are also screened and controlled items are stored securely. Illegal items are referred to the police. The <span style="font-style:italic;">Migration Act 1958 </span>does not provide detention service provider staff or officers of the Department of Immigration and Citizenship the powers to search a visitor's clothing. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Small">(2) Since 1 January 2008, there have been a number of items located in immigration detention facilities that are not permitted. These items may be located upon entry, during routine searches in immigration detention facilities or during other searches that occur from time to time often as a result of information.  The table below summarises the detection of items that are not permitted in immigration detention facilities since 1 January 2008. </span>
              </p>

                <span class="HPS-Small">Actions taken by the detention services provider in relation to items located in immigration detention facilities that are not permitted are recorded in multiple systems depending upon the nature of the items located. The very detailed information sought in the question is not readily available in consolidated form and it would be a major task to manually interrogate relevant systems. The department estimates that this would take a departmental officer an average of 30 minutes for each incident. This equates to approximately 24 working days.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Small">The possession of items not permitted in immigration detention facilities may affect the placement of the client within the immigration detention network. Action can also be taken against clients who exhibit illegal or antisocial behaviour, such as the possession of weapons or illicit drugs. The detention service provider may develop individual behavioural agreements with clients who exhibit illegal or antisocial behaviour, which allow for the implementation of interventionist or restrictive measures.  </span>

                <span class="HPS-Small">Recent amendments to the Migration Act make provision for a person to fail the character test if convicted of an offence while in immigration detention. This may, in turn, affect a client's visa outcome. </span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">
                  <a href="3L6" type="MemberAnswer">
                    <span class="HPS-MemberAnswer">Senator Conroy:</span>
                  </a>  The Minister for Foreign Affairs has provided the following answer to the honourable senator's question:</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Small">(1)   The Australian Government regards the development and use of the waters of the Mekong River Basin as sovereign decisions for Mekong governments. However the Australian Government is concerned that deliberation processes about Mekong water resources development are transparent, well-informed and inclusive, as the livelihoods of millions of people may be affected. The Australian Government's technical support provided under the Australian Mekong Water Resources Program and policy advocacy about the Procedures for Notification, Prior Consultation and Agreement (PNPCA) process supports this ambition. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Small">(2)   The MRC met at ministerial level in Siem Reap, Cambodia from 7-9 December 2011 to further discuss the proposed Xayaburi Hydropower Dam proposal. There was no direct statement on the Xayaburi Hydropower Dam issued at that meeting. Member countries agreed to conduct further studies on the sustainable development and management of the Mekong River, including the impacts of mainstream hydropower development projects. The MRC has not officially announced that the formal Xayaburi Hydropower Dam deliberation process has completed.  </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Small">(3)   The Australian Government notes the status of the formal Xayaburi Hydropower Dam deliberation process is uncertain. The Australian Government, and other MRC development partners, consider that there are many key remaining knowledge gaps about the potential impact of Xayaburi Hydropower Dam proposal and other Mekong mainstream dam proposals. The potential impact of the Xayaburi Hydropower dam proposal, and others like it, on fisheries and sediment flows are areas that in particular warrant further research. Therefore Australia and other MRC development partners have urged (through a range of fora that includes the MRC), that the results of research work into these issues needs to be made available and discussed with all relevant stakeholders before any Lower Mekong mainstream dam proposal proceeds to construction, including the Xayaburi Hydropower Dam.  </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Small">(4)   Australia took the lead in formulating a joint MRC development partner statement, which addressed the dam, delivered to the 7-9 December 2011 MRC Council meeting. In this statement donors welcomed the decision reached at the Council meeting to conduct further studies on the sustainable development and management of the Mekong River, including the impacts of mainstream hydropower development projects. The statement noted that the study should draw upon the best of international scientific, social and economic advice and holistic consultation processes and that MRC development partners would assist the MRC to ensure this was realized. The statement urged that the results of the research work needed to be available and discussed before any Lower Mekong mainstream dam proposal proceeds to construction, including the Xayaburi Hydropower Dam.    </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Small">(5)   The Australian Government will continue to engage with all MRC Member States in support of dam deliberation processes that are well-informed, transparent and allow for contestability. The Australian Government's aim is to support, and advocate for, robust deliberative processes in the countries and communities most affected. The Australian Government wants to ensure the benefits and costs are fully considered, and that as a result, informed decisions are taken by the governments of the Mekong basin countries. The Australian Government's support for, and engagement with, the MRC and its Member States supports these objectives. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Small">(6)   Australia's Ambassador to Laos has raised the Xayaburi Hydropower dam on several occasions with senior members of the Government of Laos. These have included the Minister in the Prime Minister's Office and Head of the Water Resources and Environment Administration, the Minister for Planning and Investment, and the Minister for Natural Resources and Environment. During these meetings Australia advocated for a transparent and well informed Xayaburi hydropower dam deliberation process that would allow for meaningful discussions by all interested stakeholders. Australia and other donors have continued to call for this through the Joint MRC development partner statement to the December 2011 MRC Council meeting.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Small">(7)   <span style="&#xD;&#xA;    font-family:;&#xD;&#xA;  ">T</span>he Australian Government has not called for a 10 year moratorium of Mekong mainstream dam construction. The Australian Government judges it would be more productive to continue to engage with MRC Member States in support of dam deliberation processes that are well-informed, transparent and allow for contestability. The Australian Government's aim is to support, and advocate for, robust deliberative processes in the countries and communities most affected. The Australian Government wants to ensure the benefits and costs are fully considered, and that as a result, informed decisions are taken by the sovereign nations of the Mekong basin. </span>

              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Small">(1) Following the Government's administrative arrangements order of October 1998, the Child Support Agency (CSA) was established as a separate entity from the Australian Taxation Office (ATO). Memorandums of Understanding (MOUs) and other agreements were put in place to support effective ongoing collaboration between the agencies to ensure legislative requirements are met on an ongoing basis. These agreements set out the protocols for the exchange of taxpayer information and facilitate compliance with the information-handling obligations of CSA and the ATO.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Small">Information sharing arrangements were included in an agreement between CSA and the ATO which came into effect on 2 August 1999. Further, an MOU was signed on 30 June 2004, with the objective of formalising the links between the agencies in relation to information required to support CSA's assessment, collection and enforcement activities. On 6 September 2007, a head MOU between the agencies came into effect. A subsidiary arrangement under the head MOU for access by CSA to ATO information was signed on 19 November 2009. A revised version of the subsidiary arrangement came into effect on 25 November 2011. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Small">(2) The information sharing arrangements between the ATO and CSA have not changed since the coming into law of the <span style="font-style:italic;">Tax Laws Amendment (Confidentiality of Taxpayer Information) Act 2010</span><span style="font-style:italic;">. </span>This Act consolidated the secrecy provisions that had previously existed in 18 taxation law Acts and placed them in Division 355 of Schedule 1 to the <span style="font-style:italic;">Taxation Administration Act 1953</span>. The Act did not change the effect of the legal authority under which the ATO may disclose taxpayer information to the Child Support Registrar. ATO officers have remained able to disclose taxpayer information to the Child Support Registrar 'for the purpose of administering the <span style="font-style:italic;">Child Support (Registration and Collection) Act 1988</span> or the <span style="font-style:italic;">Child Support (Assessment) Act 1989</span>' (item 7 in table 1 in subsection 355-65(2) of Schedule 1 to the <span style="font-style:italic;">Taxation Administration Act 1953)</span>. The new taxation secrecy framework had no effect on the Child Support Registrar's information gathering powers under child support legislation. The Registrar continues to be able to exercise powers in the child support legislation to require the Commissioner to provide information about taxpayers, including tax file numbers. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Small">(3) The MOU and subsidiary arrangements between the ATO and CSA have generally not been published. They may, like any document, be the subject of a request under the <span style="font-style:italic;">Freedom of Information Act 1982</span>. The 19 November 2009 'Subsidiary Arrangement – Access to Tax Office Information' is now available to the public on the Parliament of Australia website.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Small">(4) The first formal administrative arrangement put in place in relation to access to taxation information by CSA was the agreement relating to information sharing arrangements that came into effect on 2 August 1999. This administrative arrangement did not in itself allow access to information. It merely set in place administrative arrangements for carrying out activities involving both the ATO and CSA, including the disclosure of information as permitted or required by relevant taxation and child support laws.</span>

He is a former Inspector-General of Intelligence and Security. He has also held other senior Commonwealth appointments, including Deputy Secretary in the Department of the Prime Minister and Cabinet and Deputy Commonwealth Ombudsman. Defence decided to review the Act in order to capture the lessons from its experience of applying it in recent years and to ensure that the legislation and surrounding processes reflect current regulatory best practice. This review will complement a review of decision-making processes under the Act, conducted in 2010 by Mr Martin Brady AO. </span>

                <span class="HPS-Small">(1) The Fair Work Act 2009 provided a new a legislated entitlement to long service leave. Long service leave forms part of the National Employment Standards (NES). In general terms, under the NES employees are entitled to long service leave in accordance with their applicable pre-modernised award. If an employee's pre-modernised award does not contain an entitlement to long service leave, their leave entitlements are determined by the applicable state or territory long service leave legislation. </span>

                <span class="HPS-Small">(2) The existing long service leave NES is a transitional entitlement pending the development of a uniform national long service leave standard. To my knowledge, there was no commitment to achieve this measure by June 2009. The Government is continuing to work with states and territories to reach agreement on a national long service leave standard. Given the diverse range of long service leave provisions in state and territory legislation, reaching agreement is a complex task. </span>

                <span class="HPS-Small">(1) (a) The strategic assessment and Plan for the Browse LNG Precinct will be considered after it is submitted by the West Australian Government, the lead proponent.

              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Small">(4) On 26 May 2011, a delegate from the Australian Government Department of Sustainability, Environment, Water, Population and Communities determined, under the EPBC Act, that the proposal to build an access road to James Price Point was not a controlled action, if carried out in a particular manner. This decision requires Main Roads Western Australia to ensure measures are in place to minimise impacts on the Greater Bilby during road construction. In October 2011 the department received an ecological report prepared on behalf of two groups (the Goolarabooloo and the 'Broome No Gas Community') regarding the presence of Greater Bilby in the James Price Point area. The department has considered this new information, however, it does not alter the department's view regarding the likely significance of the works undertaken to date.  </span>

                <span class="HPS-Small">(6) and (7)  Yes. There is a proposal to establish a peer review panel outlined in the <span style="font-style:italic;">Browse LNG Precinct: Scope of the Strategic Assessment </span>report prepared by the WA Government in 2010. However, preparation of a scoping report is not a requirement under the EPBC Act strategic assessment process. </span>
              </p>

                    <span class="HPS-MemberAnswer">Senator Ludwig:</span>
                  </a>  Minister for Emergency Management has provided the following answer to the honourable senator's question.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Small">(1) A significant enhancement to the existing national telephone-based emergency warning system (Emergency Alert and Western Australia's StateAlert) will be delivered through the location based capability. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Small">The existing system sends warning messages to landlines and to mobile phones based on the customer's registered service address. The enhancement will enable emergency services agencies to send SMS warning messages to mobile phones based on the last known location of the handset.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Small">The upgraded system will enable state and territory emergency services agencies to elect to send warnings to mobile phones based on the registered service address and/or based on the last known location of the mobile handset. Sending the SMS warning message to the last known location or the registered service address, or both, will be an operational decision in each case.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Small">Negotiations with telecommunications carriers are being led by Victoria. The Victorian Government (on behalf of all states and territories) has signed a contract with Telstra Corporation to deliver this enhancement. It is understood that Telstra has committed to Victoria to deliver location based SMS warnings to mobile telephones on their network in time for the next disaster season (November 2012).</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Small">Negotiations with the other telecommunications carriers, Optus and Vodafone Hutchison Australia, are ongoing. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Small">(2) The Emergency Alert system is designed with full redundancy and the project schedule is designed to minimise any operational impact. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Small">(3) Emergency Alert has an intuitive and sophisticated drawing tool which is used to define the geographic boundaries of the emergency warning message area on a detailed map (for example, a region, town, street, block or shopping centre) by drawing a polygon.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Small">Using the drawing tool, the polygon can be created using a variety of techniques to increase or decrease its size or create a customised shape through nominating desired boundary points.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Small">(4) Primary responsibility for the protection of life, property and the environment rests with the states and territories in their capacity as first responders. Emergency Alert is a state and territory capability and as such states and territories manage the operation of the capability. Accordingly, the Commonwealth will not issue guidelines to the state and territory emergency services agencies for training and/or the operation of Emergency Alert and StateAlert prior to the location based capability enhancement being implemented.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Small">Victoria holds the Head Agreement with the service provider for Emergency Alert, Telstra. The Victorian Department of Justice has issued a Recommended Use Guide and developed National Telephony Warning System Guidelines in consultation with jurisdictional users of Emergency Alert. The Recommended Use Guide is part of the Emergency Alert Training Manual and will be updated with the necessary information prior to the implementation of the location based capability. This information will continue to be available via the Help Tab on Emergency Alert's live environment and training website.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Small">We understand that further training will be made available by Victoria to all states and territories ahead of the implementation of the location based enhancement. The training for the use of the system is based on the 'Train the Trainer' model. Each jurisdiction will provide the appropriate number of suitably qualified trainers to participate in the 'Train the Trainer' program who will in turn then train their jurisdiction's users. Telstra as the Service Provider of the Emergency Alert system (which will include the user interface for the location based enhancement) has been contracted to run multiple 'Train the Trainer' sessions.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Small">Qualified users will also continue to have access to a separate stand alone training environment, the Emergency Alert Service Desk, Victorian Government project team and good practice learnings.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Small">(5) Funding to establish the location based capability for telephone-based emergency warnings has not been announced, so as to not prejudice ongoing negotiations with the telecommunications carriers.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Small">It is stressed that while the upcoming upgrade to the Emergency Alert and StateAlert systems is an important addition to emergency warning systems capabilities, telephone-based emergency warnings are only one means for emergency services agencies to warn the community.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Small">Communities should not rely solely on receiving a telephone-based emergency warning. Once a decision to warn communities in an emergency has been made, emergency services agencies will determine what method will be used—for example radio, web, or television—and whether a telephone alert needs to be issued. </span>
