                    </a>  I think the slippery slope, Senator Birmingham, is the plebiscite; that is the slippery slope. We all know that the plebiscite is a mindless political stunt. I am going to do something I do not normally do. I am going to quote two sources that I normally do not quote. I am going to quote the Vatican and I am going to quote Paul Kelly in the <span style="font-style:italic;">Australian</span>. Those who are on the Senate Environment and Communications Legislation Committee with me will know that I have found a very important and serious document by the Pontifical Academy of Sciences. The Pontifical Academy of Sciences is made up of some of the most eminent scientists from around the world and advises the Pope on climate change. The report by a working group commissioned by the academy starts off by saying:</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">We call on all people and nations to recognise the serious and potentially irreversible impacts of global warming caused by the anthropogenic emissions of greenhouse gases and other pollutants â¦</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The report then goes on to outline why serious governments, why serious politicÂ­ians, around the world are dealing with this issue in a serious way. They outline in this document the glacier melting that is taking place around the world, why that is being caused by humans and how we should deal with this. I recommend to all of those in the opposition who every Sunday are in chapel, practising their faith, that they look at what the Pontifical Academy of Sciences is saying. I think it is a very important message to everyone in this place about the importÂ­ance of dealing with global warmingâbecause what we should understand is that this Carbon Tax Plebiscite Bill 2011 [No. 2] is not about plebiscites; it is a short-term political ploy. That is all it is.</span>

                    </a>  Yes, it certainly is a stunt. What we have here is analysis by the Pontifical Academy of Sciences that backs up everything that is being said by scientists not only in Australia but around the worldâthat is, that global warming is real, sea levels are rising and the climate is getting more unpredictable, and that there are significant health implications and significant implicatÂ­ions for infrastructure around the world. </span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The only people in Australia that I see consistently standing up and opposing this consensus among scientists are those in the coalition who have been absolutely captured by the extremists and climate change deniers. We have Senator Cormann, who, as I indicated in my last contribution, does not mind sharing a stage with Lord Monckton, the biggest climate change denier in the world. People treat him as an absolute joke. But we had Senator Cormann queuing up to get Lord Monckton's autograph.</span>

                    </a>  Yes, all the lunatics together. So that is the issue. The issue is: are politicians going to take climate change seriously, are governments going to take climate change seriously and are we going to make sure that our children have an opportunity in the future to enjoy an environment that is sustainable? That is the issue. If anyone from the opposition wants to have a look at the paper from the working group commissioned by the Pontifical Academy of Sciences I would be happy to send them a copy.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The next one I want to quote is again from somewhere I do not like quoting from. I do not normally quote from there because most of the quotes are taken up by the coalition anyway. The coalition are in there quick smart. Whenever the <span style="font-style:italic;">Australian</span> pontificates about something, the coalition are in there and quoting the <span style="font-style:italic;">Australian</span>. But I think I would even have to concede that Paul Kelly, the editor at large, has some standing in political analysis within Australia. I must say that I think Paul Kelly's standing has been improved by this article that I am about to quote from. In the <span style="font-style:italic;">Australian</span> of 22 June 2011, under the heading 'Abbott's plebiscite call a serious misjudgment'ânot just a misÂ­judgment but a 'serious' misjudgmentâPaul Kelly says:</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I do not think the coalition stand for much these days. I think they are totally populist. So I think Mr Kelly has it a bit wrong there. They are totally a populist party, captured by the extremists on industrial relations, the extremists on climate change, those that would be extreme on the issue of race and those that would be extreme on the issue of making this country a good country to live in. So what does Paul Kelly say? He says:</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Did you get that? Paul Kelly from the <span style="font-style:italic;">Australian</span> says it is a 'bad idea'. He goes on to say that that bad idea 'advances neither democracy, good government nor sound public policy.' </span>

I suppose it depends on who he was talking to the night before when he makes the statements on climate change. He is totally inconsistent and all over the place on climate change. But what we do understand is that he does not believe it. He believes it is crap. That is what the Leader of the Opposition said: 'It's crap'.</span>

Each of these 10 policies has been instrumental in improving our society and economy. It is likely none of them would have passed a plebiscite at the time.</span>

                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">When outgoing senator Steve Fielding, after meeting the Opposition Leader and hearing his case, repudiates it as a "stunt", then Abbott is scraping the bottom of the barrel.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Well, is he ever! The king of stunts, former Senator Fielding, actually would not associate with this stunt. I just think that says it all, and Paul Kelly has really got you lot under control here in this little article. He goes on to say:</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Small">While Abbott said his intent was to "let the people decide", he refused to agree he would abandon his own opposition to the tax if any carbon tax plebiscite was carried. In short, he doesn't take his own proposal seriously. It may have been mildly interesting if Abbott had said he was ready to fall into line with the result. No such concession.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">So what has Paul Kelly done here? He has exposed the hypocrisy of the coalition. They call for a plebiscite, but they do not really want a plebiscite; they do not want to accept any outcome from the plebiscite. Paul Kelly only puts it as far as saying it would be 'mildly interesting' if they were even serious about accepting the outcome of a plebiscite, which they are not. So this plebiscite is nothing more than a massive political stunt to add to the political stunts that permeate the coalition as a political party in this placeâstunt after stunt. I did describe the Leader of the Opposition a couple of weeks ago as the Evel Knievel of Australian politicsâall stunt and no substance. That is what the leader of the coalition is. Paul Kelly continues.</span>

You see, it is a one-sided plebiscite. It is not just a stunt of a plebiscite; it is a one-sided plebiscite that would apply only to the government but not to the coalitÂ­ion. No wonder Senator Fielding looked aghast at the coalitionâat the height and temerity of the coalition to run a stunt like this. When you have former Senator Fielding aghast at a stunt, you know it is the real big stunt of all time. This is a stunt to end all stuntsâone that makes Senator Fielding blush. What a joke!

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Eighty million dollars of public money to run a plebiscite to do what? A glorified poll to say this is what people think at the moment. It means nothing. It is non-binding. Paul Kelly said:</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Small">It is a government-sponsored and paid for national opinion poll whose authority derives from that fact.

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Then Mr Kelly goes on to outline the history of plebiscites in this country. I would call on the coalition to look at the history of plebiÂ­scites and why you should not run divisive plebiscites in this country. So what Paul Kelly has done in one article is demolish any credibility that the coalition might think they have. You have no credibility on economic mattersâwe know that. You left this country ill-prepared to deal with the challenges of climate change and globalisationâabsoluteÂ­ly ill-prepared. Your only economic policy was Work Choices, to rip away at workers' wages and conditions. Let me tell you: Paul Kelly has got you guys nailed. He has nailed you and he has said you are incompetent, you have no values, you have no principles and you have abandoned any idea that you have any way forward for this country. Paul Kelly has got you guys nailed. You should be ashamed. When you stand up here, you tell me how you deal with the Kelly arguÂ­ment, because you cannot. <span style="font-style:italic;">(Time expired)</span></span>

I am sorry. Isn't this the government that just a couple of weeks ago increased its borrowings from $200 billion to $250 billion? Mind you, colleagues, they did not give us a chance to actually scrutinise this. Oh, noâthey slipped it in with the appropriations bill. Of course, we all know that parliament accedes to those things so the operation of government can happen. They tried to hide it awayâ$250 billion. Do you know how much we are going to be paying in interest every day over the next financial year, Senator Cash? Fifteen million dollars a day in interest. So, Senator Cameron, do not sit on that side of the chamber and lecture this side of this chamber, which left you with a surplus, about our economic credibility.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The Australian people now are in absolutely no doubt whatsoever about what the government thinks of them. What the Carbon Tax Plebiscite Bill 2011 does is give the Australian people a say. It gives the Australian people the opportunity to say whether or not they want a carbon tax. What did Senator Cameron just call that opporÂ­tunity? A mindless political stunt. Senator Cameron and the Labor government think that giving the Australian people a say is a mindless political stunt. To anybody out there who might be watching this or who might at some point be reading this, that is what this Labor government under Julia Gillard thinks of you. It thinks that giving you a say is a mindless political stunt. I would say that any Australian, having been told that, would think: 'What is this governÂ­ment going on about? Why can't we have a say? Why can't we consider whether or not we as Australian families, workers and indiÂ­viduals want to actually have a carbon tax?' But, oh no: this government will not do that.</span>
                </p>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Why don't you stay, Senator Cameron? Why don't you stay? It might be nice if you actually stayed here for the debate. Let us just have a look at Senator Cameron. Isn't it interesting when he talks about mindless political stunts? Mindless? The only other thing he was talking about as being mindless was his colleagues when he called them all zombies. That was the last mindless thing that Senator Cameron was talking about. So it is quite interesting to see him stand here today and lecture us when all we are doing is attempting to give the Australian people a say on whether or not they want a carbon tax.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Of course, a plebiscite would have a cost, and Senator Cameron has just raised thatâ$80 million. The hypocrisy from Senator Cameron and this government saying there is a cost attached to this plebiscite! Let me tell you, Mr Deputy President: they spent $80.9 million on administering an emissions tradÂ­ing scheme that does not even exist. And Senator Cameron has the hypocrisy to sit on that side of the chamber and tell us we are potentially wasting money. It is just extraordinary.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The Australian people are waking up to this government, and thank goodness they are. How dare this government try to introÂ­duce a carbon tax, the biggest single issue that this country has had to deal with for decades, without letting the Australian peoÂ­ple have a sayâthose mums and dads living in the suburbs in Sydney, those farmers out there in regional Australia, those workers, those truckies driving across the country, those people working in small businesses, those people in schools teaching, those nurses and those doctors? Everybody across the community has no chance to have a say and to tell this government whether or not they want a carbon tax. That is simply wrong, because we know that before the last election this Prime Minister, Julia Gillard, having managed to get to the position of leader of the Australian Labor Party through means that were somewhat less than elegant, said to the Australian people, 'There will be no carbon tax under a government I lead.' It is always good for prime ministers to be very clear about what they say and to be very clear in their intent. There can be nothing taken out of context when you know exactly what they say and that that is what they mean. Julia Gillard said, 'There will be no carbon tax under any government I lead.'</span>

We are putting forward the opportunity for them to have a say. We are putting forward the opportunity for them to be able to say to the Prime Minister and this Labor government whether or not they want a carbon tax. How dare the Prime Minister say: 'I know what's best for you; you can have a carbon tax, and I'm not going to listen to you. Not only am I not going to listen to you, but I'm not even going to give you an opportunity to tell me what you think. Somewhere in between these elections, I will actually bring in this carbon tax and I will not give you a say on whether or not you want it.' That is about the lowest point this country has got to for a long, long period of time. Mr Acting Deputy President, I draw your attention toâand I am sure my good colleague Senator Scullion remembers this from the campaignâthe Treasurer, Wayne Swan, on 15 August 2010, saying when discussing the issue of whether or not there would be a carbon tax, 'Certainly, what we rejected was this hysterical allegation that somehow we are moving towards a carbon tax.' That is very interesting. Apparently my coalition colleagues and I, having said during the last election campaign that this governÂ­ment would be bringing in a carbon tax, were making a hysterical allegation. </span>

There are 10 out of 226, and the way things are going at the moment the Greens are running the country. I know they are probably very happy every time we say that, but let me tell you that the Australian people out there are not. I am happy to place on record that Senator Bob Brown got 1Â½ million votes; 1Â½ million voted for himâ11 million did not. It is quite extraordinary that we have this situation with a carbon tax coming in as a result of the Labor-Greens government when the Greens have 10 out of 226 members of parliament and 1.5 million votes out of 12Â½ million. It does not sound like a really good case for democracy to me. It does not really sound like the majority of the Australian people having their say.

If, all of a sudden, the Greens have become more important to the Prime Minister than her own backbench, then I am sure that her very own backbench would be rather upset. They would be rather upset to think that Bob Brown and his nineâ10 all up, out of 226 members of parliaÂ­mentâwould get a briefing from the Prime Minister on something this important before the Labor backbench did.

I am so concerned about the impact of this. I do not think I have ever been more concerned about the potential impact of a piece of legislation. And, Senator Furner, it is not scaremongerÂ­ing. This is not scaremongering. We are not hysterical. We are out there every day trying to explain to the Australian people what the impacts and the ramifications of having a carbon tax in this country are going to be. They are going to be devastating on the cost of living, of food and of some aspects of fuelâgoodness knows what we are going to hear on Sunday.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I put the government on notice: if you even try to touch the diesel fuel rebateâif you even try to touch the arrangements for off-road vehiclesâa storm will come down on your head, the likes of which you have never seen. That excise is not paid because vehicles are off-road vehicles; that excise goes to road users because they use the roads. There is a very good reason that those off-road vehicles do not pay that excise. I say to the Prime Minister right now: do not even think about changing those arrangements, or the wrath of regional Australia will land on your doorstep.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">It is not just that. There are so many areas where there will be an impact, and the impact on farmers and regional communities is going to be the greatest. Even Ross Garnaut said in his report that farmers, more than most other Australians, will face higher fuel and transport costs under the proposed tax. Certainly fuel might have been removed from the scheme for some usersâwho would know? We will find out on Monday. But I bet you pounds to peanuts it will still be on transport, which is a key component for regional communities. That is why this carbon tax will be so much worse for regional Australiaâbecause of transport, because of the tyranny of distance. It costs more to get everything to the regions than it does to deliver it into a city area. That puts costs on everything, right across the board.</span>

This carbon tax is not going to make the slightest bit of difference to the climate. That is something that we on this side of the chamber understand and that those out there in the community are starting to understand. They realise that we are going to put thousands of jobs at risk. We know that industry is going to move offshore. We know that the anticompetitive nature of bringing this carbon tax in is going to be huge.

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I am particularly concerned as a regional, Nationals senator about the effect this is going to have on our farmers and our regional communities, because the effect it will have on farmers will flow right through those communities. Everybody out there knows that when the agricultural sector is not doing well it flows right through, down our main streets, to the newsagents, the clothes shops, the service stations on the corner, the teachers, the schools, policing, the numbers in schoolsâeverything. It flows right through.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We have the NFF saying that if fuel used in agricultural production is included then the tax will slug beef producers with an extra $7,000 in costs every year and that cotton-farming families are going to face a five per cent cut to their farm income. It goes on and on and on. And for what? We are going to have a seismic shift in our economy that is going to hit families, carers, individuals, hip pockets right across the country. This government will stand up and say, 'No, it's not going to do that, because we are going to compensate.' What a load of rubbish.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Those emitters are going to pass those costs on, and when we move to an emissions trading schemeâwhich this government says we willâthe price will fluctuate. Is the Prime Minister going to compensate people when that price is fluctuating day by day? Who knows where it is going to end up? It will be pushed by traders. It might get to the $100 a tonne that Greens senator Sarah Hanson-Young would like to see, and that is not good enough. The Australian people deserve better. They deserve to have a say on this carbon tax. They deserve the opportunity to have their voice heard on this very important issue.</span>

The Greens will be opposing this legislationâthe Carbon Tax Plebiscite Bill 2011 [No. 2]âbecause it entertains a fair degree of silliness as well as a large degree of public expenditure. In fact, when you look at the cost of up to $100 million for a plebiscite, then, based on the argument we have just heard from Senator Nash about imposing on people a cost that is unwarranted, that ought to be at the outset a measure for ruling out the idea. It was no doubt a political move by the Leader of the Opposition that was then introduced into this place by Senator Abetz. Proposed section 6 of this bill, under the heading 'Question to be submitted to electors', says:</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Small">The question to be submitted to electors in accordance with section 5 is âDo you support the Governmentâs plan to introduce a price on carbon to deal with climate change?â.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">So at the outset the whole of Senator Nash's contention is demolished because the question has nothing to do with a tax; it is about a price on carbon. I will come back to that in a little while because that is exactly what the Leader of the Opposition, Tony Abbott, is proposing to do with his alternaÂ­tiveâthat is, to put a price on carbon which will be imposed on the people of Australia. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The difference here is that Mr Abbott and Senator Abetz want to have that price paid for in a reverse mechanismâthey want to take money off the Australian people and give it to the polluters, with the aim that the polluters will use the money to reduce the pollution in their coal fired power stations and other polluting enterprises. The governÂ­ment, several Independents and the Greens are moving to reverse that and have the polluters pay through pricing mechanismsâtherefore, forcing them to clean up their pollution because they will want to avoid that paymentâand then use the money from the permits paid for by the polluters to enable the Australian economy to move to a clean, green basis in the future, creating tens of thousands of jobs and offsetting the cost by paying householders compensation for the flow-on costs of the carbon price in terms of increased prices in particular for energy and very minimal changes then to costs at supermarkets and so on.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">So, in a nutshell, Mr Abbott and Senator Abetz are proposing that the Australian people have billions of dollars taken off them and given to the big foreign owned polluting corporationsâand most of them areâwhereas the Greens, the government and the Independents involvedâthe Hon. Tony Windsor and the Hon. Rob Oakeshott from the House of Representativesâare in the cabinet subcommittee looking at this matter to ensure that householders are looked after. People are beginning to understand that. There is going to be a change of mood in the electorate because the Leader of the Opposition and the coalition are taking the Australian electorate as being fools, but they are not. The Leader of the Opposition has changed his position and will continue to change his position according to a political tub-thumping approach which has no depth. We heard the Leader of the Opposition saying as recently as Friday, 1 July at a conference of economists:</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">It may well be, as you say, that most Australian economists think that the carbon tax or emissions trading scheme is the way to go.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">Maybe that's a comment on the quality of our economists rather than on the merits of the argument.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We had here the extraordinary claim from the Leader of the Opposition that all the economists in Australiaâand I mean all the economists in Australiaâare wrong and he is right. Australians looking at that are going to recognise that it is the Leader of the Opposition who is wrong, because he cannot simply make that claim without substantiatÂ­ing it and he has not been able to substantiate it. The Leader of the Opposition, Mr Tony Abbott, has changed his position quite frequently. He said in 2009:</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">If you want to put a price on carbon why not just do it with a simple tax? ... Why not ask electricity consumers to pay more? And then at the end of the year, you can take your invoices to the tax office and get a rebate ... It would be burdensome, all taxes are burdensome, but it would certainly ... raise the price on carbon without increasing in any way the overall tax burden.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">So we had there Tony Abbott endorsing the very argument that he now opposes. We had there Tony Abbott putting forward a proposal supported by economists which he has since reneged on while the economists have gone on with further study to say that the government-Greens-Independents propoÂ­sal is the most economically efficient and therefore is the cheapest for the Australian people to save us from the much greater economic impact of climate change, global warming and the destruction that has not just on our food-producing lands and our coastal cities, towns and properties but on great economic, environmental and job-producing entities like the Great Barrier Reef. In 2009 Mr Abbott said:</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">I think that the science is far from settled but on the insurance principle you are prepared to take reasonable precautions against significant potential risks, and that's I think why it makes sense to have an ETS.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">It is an emissions trading scheme that he is now opposing. The very thing he proposed he is now opposing. You can imagine a referendum campaign in which the people of Australia are exposed to support for the government-Greens-Independent position repeatedly being out of the Leader of the Opposition's own mouth. It would be an exercise in futility and at great expense to the Australian people which would be lost. When we look at the position taken by Mr Abbott and Senator Abetz, which is to take money from the Australian exchequer, from the taxpayers, and give it to the polluters we find that Mr Abbott has said his direct action planâ</span>

                    </a>  Thank you. Mr Abbott has costed his attack on the taxpayer's pocket at around a cumulative $10 billion by 2020. The problem with his $10 billion by 2020 is that the Department of Climate Change has estimated the plan would not see emissions at 2020 at his target of a reduction of five per cent; instead, emissions would increase to 13 to 17 per cent above 1990 levels. If you are going to get to the opposiÂ­tion's claimed target of a five per cent reduction it would cost a further $20 billion including the purchase of overseas permits.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">When you cost that out you find that by 2020 the Abbott plan would cost the average Australian household $720 per annum with no compensation. That is the fraud that is involved in that proposal. I reiterate that the alternative plan being developed by the committee on a climate price would ensure that householders are compensatedâsome people in the poorest circumstances would indeed be overcompensatedâso that the impact of the carbon price will be completely offset. Not with Mr Abbott's plan. He will be hitting householdsâand very often they are big energy consumers because they do not have the wherewithal to have engaged in energy-saving devices and mechanismsâand that includes households in the coalition heartland, for $720 per annum. What a difficulty for the leader of the coalition and for Senator Abetz, the Leader of the Opposition in the Senate, whose absence from this debate, here and around the country, has been extraordinarily notable. The reason for that is that Senator Abetz, who has this bill before the Senate, simply does not understand the economics of it and has been not engaged in justifying the attack on the average taxpayer that is involved in the legislation.</span>

                    <a href="I0P" type="MemberSpeech">
                      <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Senator FURNER</span>
                    </a> (<span class="HPS-State">Queensland</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">10:33</span>):  I wish to contribute to this debate on the Carbon Tax Plebiscite Bill 2011, but before I get onto the main subject matter I wish to draw an analogy as a Queensland senator. Last night in the state of Queensland we saw a historic outcome, with six consecutive series being won by Queensland. I think the analogy here is that there were players, spectators and even referees on the field that accepted the outcomes delivered as a result of that fabulous win. It is a case that needs to be reflected on when we go to the nature of this particular bill and Mr Tony Abbott's position on wishing to have a plebiscite on something on which we know that he has no commitment and no ability to deliver. So it is a farce that we are here today in this chamber debating this bill, because we know what the outcome would be should this bill be successful. Should the public of Australia be involved in a plebiscite, that would not only waste $80 million of taxpayers' dollars but also put the Australian public further into a position where they wonder at times what Mr Tony Abbott is doing as an opposition leader. He talks all day until the cows come home about how a carbon price is supposedÂ­ly going to hurt our working families, yet he has no problem with spending that sort of money and asking the Australian public whether we should put a price on carbon at all and whether it is the right thing to do. He then says he would rescind it anyhow if he were in government.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I reflect on some notable occasions where he has been quoted. On 20 June 2011, the opposition leader was asked whether he would reconsider his position on the carbon price if the public voted yes. He said:</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">Well, obviously if the people have their say and their say is conclusive one way or another that should settle the matter.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The hypocrisy on this issue is shown in what he said later on that day to 3AW:</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">â¦ my position on carbon tax is that I am against it in opposition and I will rescind it in government.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Therefore on one hand he is saying: 'Let's have a plebiscite. Let's accept the umpire's decision.' On the other hand he is saying, 'I'm not going to accept that at all, because I'm going to rescind it if I'm in government and I won't accept it in opposition.' Once again that clearly demonstrates the typical hypoÂ­crisy in this regard. At a time when we know families are doing it tough out there and we are working responsibly through our injectÂ­ion of nearly $43 billion into the economy for protection from the global financial crisis, he wants to go out and spend $80 million of working families' hard-earned wages. So our being in this chamber debatÂ­ing this bill is really a waste of time.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Putting a price on carbon is the best way to move our country forward to a cleaner economy and environment. It is the right thing to do. How do we know this? Because the electorate told us at the last election that they want action on climate change. That is what the electorate really wants on this issue. Climate scientists have told us carbon pollution is causing climate change, and who are we to dispute this?</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Let us look at some of the facts. 2010 tied with 2005 and 1998 as the warmest years on record. The last 10 years have been recorded as the warmest decade and 2010 is the 34th consecutive year to have global temperatures above the 20th century average. Each decade has been hotter than the decade preceding it and this has happened since 1940. If we take no action on climate change, we put Australia at risk. We put Australia at risk economically over a range of different sectÂ­ors, including water security, the agricultural industry, health, coastlines, communities and energy industries. Rising temperatures lead to intensive weather conditions, and my state of Queensland has recently felt the brunt of those.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Queensland has a population of 4.5 million. Our state is known around the world for its sunny weather. No matter the season, it is the golden beaches that tourists flock to every year. With a stunning coastline come coastal communities and these are at risk if no action is taken. According to the DepartÂ­ment of Climate Change and Energy EffiÂ­ciency, between 48,300 and 67,700 residents' buildings could be at risk through rising sea levels of just 1.1 metre at a cost of between $15.4 billion and $20 billion. A rise of 1.1 metre would also affect 47,000 kilometres of Queensland roads, 570 kilometres of railway lines and 1,440 commercial buildings at a cost of more than $30 billion. Through the recent flooding and Cyclone Yasi up in the north we saw how extreme weather affected that infrastructure. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Not only is infrastructure at risk but also our health is at risk. The department believes that climate change could cause an increase in the number of days in Brisbane that have a temperature higher than 35 degrees Celsius, from one day up to 21 in a year. This would not only affect those who are sensitive to warmer temperatures like the elderly but also increase the chances of diseases such as dengue fever moving to areas of South-East Queensland.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Let us not forget the Great Barrier Reef Marine Park, which contributed $5.4 billion to our economy in 2006-07 and provides employment to 53,800 people. According to the department, sea surface temperatures across the Great Barrier Reef have increased by 0.4 degrees in the past 30 years, and increasing atmospheric carbon dioxide has also resulted in an increase in ocean acidity. These trends are expected to continue with climate change. Rising sea levels have also caused coral bleaching, and rising temperaÂ­tures can have detrimental effects on marine life. The cost of inaction is beyond price. I had the opportunity many years ago to go out on the reef on several occasions and about 18 months or two years ago, I saw signs of that coral bleaching and the effect on our beautiful Great Barrier Reef.</span>

                    </a>  I am sure you do, Senator Macdonald. You should be aware of all these issues that affect an area that you live in, but you are in complete denial. This is just a small snapshot of what we need to take action on for climate change, if not for ourselves, then for our children, our grandÂ­children and their children. We do this so that they will have a future and a life they can enjoy. </span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We believe that putting a price on carbon is the cheapest and most efficient and effective way of reducing our carbon emissions and helping our nation's transition into a cleaner economy. Our plan is to charge our 1,000 top polluters for every tonne of pollution they emit. By doing this we will provide them with incentives to switch to renewable energy. We will be providing support to emission intensive industries as well as supporting jobs. Under our own policy polluters will pay. It will bring certainty to many sectors and, most importÂ­antly, Australians will be given assistance. </span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">More than 50 per cent of revenue collected will go back into assisting AustraÂ­lians. Nine out of 10 households will receive assistance from the federal govern-ment through tax cuts. The pension will increase and family payments will be increased. This assistance will ensure that householders will not have to foot the bill for the increase in the cost of living and will allow them to do their bit to help the environment. </span>

More than three million householders will get an extra 20 per cent in tax cuts and increased payments. We will also be providing assistance to those who rely on electricity for their medical equipÂ­ment. The government knows of 110,000 Australians who rely on essential medical equipment like dialysis machines and life-support machines, just to name a couple, and we will ensure that they receive extra financial assistance to cover the cost of the rise in electricity prices with a special annual cash payment. This will be a huge economic reform and it is something that our governÂ­ment can be proud of.</span>

And I think the Australian public will get very angry and tired about that. They would say: what's wrong with you fellas, we elected you for three years, you go away and take all the decisions you want to on individual issues and then when those decisions have been taken at the end of your three year period if we don't like you we'll vote you out.

We understand the cost of living pressures and we are determined to deliver policies which will assist our families and the environment. Our track record has been consistent. We always have and we always will look out for working families. Since the Labor government was elected in 2007 we have provided tax cuts and assistance to small businesses. We have increased the pension and the childcare rebate and introduced the education tax refund. We abolished Work Choices, the Howard government evil policy which took away workers' rights; it took away leave loading and overtime rates and it was ultimately the undoing of the coalition government. For the first time in history Australia has a paid parental leave scheme, allowing working parents to stay at home and bond with their new additions without having to worry about the cost-of-living pressures, and this is on top of their employers' existing paid parental leave scheme. We accomplished all this within our tight budget. We will be delivering an increase of $4,000 in family tax benefit part A. We will extend the education tax refund to include uniforms and provide the option for families to receive the child-care rebate payments fortnightly. All our incentives are costed and fully funded. We are committed to a stronger economy and more jobs for Australians. We are investing in the future of our nation through infrastructure and investing in skills.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Small">Even though I have spent many years as an activist promoting labour market reform, I promised Opposition Leader Tony Abbott I would suspend my interest in this if I became federal president of the Liberal Party.

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Despite having given Peter Reith his commitment to vote for him, Mr Abbott instead voted for Mr Stockdale and then showed Mr Stockdale the outcome of his decision. We know this because it is in the press; the television cameras were rolling. Apparently he turned to Ms Bishop and said, 'Hell, I thought Reith would have won.' Certainly you can imagine the shock on Ms Bishop's face, because she understood that there was an arrangement and that a deal had been done. She responded, 'Yeah, well, he lost by one vote, Tony.' This is the disinÂ­genuousness of this person, whether it be in important elections for the president of the opposition party or a commitment to put a bill such as this to a plebiscite on such an important matter. You really question whether this person is genuine enough to accept an outcome. He has clearly demonÂ­strated that that is not the case; he would not accept the outcome and this is typical of the form of this particular person. </span>

                    </a> (<span class="HPS-State">Queensland</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">10:54</span>):  It is unusual for me but I must say I am almost speechless having heard the contributions from Senator Furner and Senator Brown. Senator Furner was talking about people being disingenuous; this comes from a member of a party whose leader one day before the last election put her hand on her heart and said, 'There shall be no carbon tax under a government I lead.' That is not disingenuous; it is an outright lie. If that is not a lie, I do not know what is. Listening to Senator Furner lecture people about disingenuousness is making me almost speechless. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">On the same note, we had the leader of the government, Senator Bob Brown, lecturing us on abiding by the rules in debate. Those of us with long memories remember how he used to regularly disobey police instructions, and disobey traffic rulesâI think at one stage he was in trouble with the police for breaking the rulesâand here he is in this chamber lecturing us about following the rules. As my colleague Senator Cash pointed out, he deliberately thumbs his nose at the standing orders of this chamber which say he must acknowledge the President, as we all do. Sometimes we forget. Senator Brown deliberately thumbed his nose at those rules, and at you, I might say, Mr Acting Deputy President, in his demeanour and his absolute contempt of this parliament, of this chamber and, indeed, of Australian democracy. For Senator Bob Brown to start lecturing us about abiding by the rules is just, again, almost making me speechless. I cannot wait for the time when Senator Rhiannon is head of the Greens. If I had a vote, Senator Rhiannon, I would be voting for you. I do not agree with you on much of what you do but I know that you are steadfast, that you do not involve yourself in hypocrisy as, some might say, your current leader does. I emphasise that even when it was drawn to Senator Bob Brown's attention that he should acknowledge the chair, he then deliberately got up, walked out and ignored the rules. For him to be lecturing anyone about following the rules is just mind-boggling. As I said, it almost leaves me speechless. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I wanted to participate in the debate. I have been sitting here listening to all of the contributions, because I wanted to find out from the Labor Party speakers what was in the carbon tax package that is going to be released, apparently on Sunday, with great fanfare. I had hoped that the Australian Labor Party speakers could tell us, because I know the other speaker this morning, Senator Bob Brown, knows exactly what is in the package. Yet Senator Furner does not. Senator Cameron, a very prominent member of the Australian Labor Party and of this chamber, does not know what is in it. But Senator Bob Brown does. And Senator Milne. Do you know what? Perhaps I do not have to tell you this, Mr Acting Deputy Speaker. Australian Labor Party members of parliament are going to be hooked up to a telephone call on Sunday to be told by their 'trusting leader' what is in the package. By the time that the Labor Party MPs are told what is in the package, the Greens will have already been briefed. As I said, I know Senator Bob Brown knows what is in it and, from some injudicious media comments that I heard today from other members of the Greens, I suspect that Senator Bob Brown has not kept the confidenceâI only suspect that. But the poor old Labor Party, the lobotomised zombiesâthey do not know. They have not got a clue what is in it. They have been drip-fed on the good bits and drip-fed to leak out the goodish parts, the parts where you tax people and then compensate them by giving them their money back. Great economics! So typical of the Labor Party. That is all they know. They know as much as we do. When Senator Cameron spoke in this debate, I listened to his every word. I was just waiting for him to get off the politics and the personal abuse and actually tell us what was in the carbon package, but we did not get that, because, frankly, Senator Cameron does not know. It amazes me that the Greens know every detail chapter and verse, but Senator Furner and Senator Cameron do not. Here is Senator Bob Brown back in the chamber, again acknowledging the chair, in accordance with the standing orders. He is deliberately flouting the rules of this chamber, as he has deliberately flouted the rules of the land over the years, and then he has the hide to lecture us about abiding by the rulesâan action that could only be described as hypocrisy.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Regrettably, Senator Furner and Senator Cameron do not know; none of the Labor speakers know. Perhaps I could ask Senator McEwen or Senator Carol Brown. Perhaps they could tell us. But I know they cannot tell us, because they do not know either. Senator Bob Brown knows, but the Labor Party does not. Who is running this goverÂ­ment? I do not need to tell you who is running this government. It is the Greens, led by a manâSenator Bob Brownâwho deliberately flouts the rules of this chamber and, as we have seen from his history, civil law on occasion as well.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">In these contributions from the Greens-Labor alliance members I did hear them say that everybody wants a carbon tax. Perhaps they are right. Perhaps all the opinion polls are wrong. Let me give them the benefit of the doubt. Let me take Senator Bob Brown's word. It will be the only time in history I have ever done that, but just as an exercise, let us take his word. If he is so confident that the people of Australia want a carbon tax, then let us have a plebiscite. What could be fairer than that? What is wrong with that? Why would you not ask the Australian people what they want? Mr Abbott has said, very publicly and very directly, that he will abide by the results of the plebiscite.</span>

                    </a>  Senator McLucas is again trying to mislead the Senate with her interjection. With thanks to Senator Cormann, I quote from Mr Abbott's speech at Parliament House on 4 July. He said:</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">So let us have a plebiscite. What could be fairer? What objection could you have to that? If you do not want a plebiscite, then let us go to the ultimate plebiscite. If Senator Brown is so confident that he will win this debate, perhaps he could move a vote of no confidence in the government and bring the government down. We can go to an electionâmake it a double dissolution. I know the Labor Party would be petrified of this, because Senator Cameron and Senator Furner would not even make it in a double dissolution, let me tell you. One is from Queensland, the other from New South Wales. Senator Sterle, from Western Australia, would not make it either. I can confidently predict that in Queensland and Western Australia Labor not only would Labor lose every lower house seat on this particular issue but also, I suspect, there would be very few senators elected from those states.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">So let us have the vote if Senator Brown is confident that all Australians want this carbon taxâthat all Australians want to increase their cost of living and want to be burdened. If many Australians want to lose their jobs, particularly up in Central QueensÂ­land and North Queensland, where I come fromâif he is so confident that that is what they wantâlet us have a vote. This is a democracy. What could be fairer than having a vote?</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">But will the Greens-Labor government that rules this country be interested in that? Are they at all interested in what the people of Australia might say? Of course not. What we have had so far from the Greens and the Labor Partyâand this will ramp up incredibly with $12 million of taxpayers' money, which the Labor-Greens alliance is going to be using to run a political campaign to try to retrieve their electoral fortunesâis this dishonest campaign by the government.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The facts of the carbon tax are continually misrepresented by the Labor Party. Actually, in the last few years, the world's temperature has fallen, yet Senator Furner quoted some figures suggesting the opposite. I have pointed out before a CSIRO graph that shows that 140,000 years ago the sea levels were about where they are today. The graph also shows that over these 140,000 years the sea levels fell, until about 20,000 years ago, when they rose overnight to almost where they are now. I am not sure that industry and man's behaviour caused that rise in sea levels 20,000 years ago. I am only a simple person; I am not a scientist.</span>

                    </a>  We agree on that, Senator McLucasâone of the few things we agree on. But I can read the graph. It goes like this: sea level there; a fall down to there; and 20,000 years ago it went straight up like that. What caused that? Human beings' industrialisation? I do not know. Ask the CSIRO. In fact, I have asked them in a question on notice. I am still waiting for the response. So this is the sort of campaign that is being run by Labor and the Greens and this is what will happen.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">As I say, I do not presume to lecture other people on things like science; I have always been quite clear on that. Of course climate is changingâthere is never any doubt about that in my mind. Is man doing it? I do not know. I have been open about that. I have heard a lot of scientists say it is; I have heard a lot of scientists say it is not. If they cannot agree, what chance have I got? So my position has never changed.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">But what I do say is: why do you penalise Australians with this sort of ridiculous, job-destroying carbon tax when nobody else in the world is doing it? I would hope someone in the Labor Party might get up and quote us the figures from the United Statesâ'Well, there are lots of states doing it.' If they read recent history, they will find that most of the states in the United States that used to do something like this are withdrawing and getting out of it as quickly as possible, because these carbon trading schemes are a farce. The United States congress has made it quite clear that they will not be having one bar of any emissions trading scheme or carbon tax. The Chinese are often quoted, but even the government and, I suspect, Senator Brown, now have to acknowledge that, while the Chinese people are reducing their output of carbon by certain means, at the same time they are building new coal-fired power stations every day, so that the net result for China will be continuing increases in carbon.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">What will this tax do for Australians? It will increase their cost of living, particularly for those of us who live remote from the capital cities. Of course, I know the Labor Party and the Greens are not interested in that; they do not get any support out in the real world. You have only to look at the fiasco on live cattle to understand that they have no interest in, no empathy for and no understanding of the human livesâlet alone the businesses and family historiesâbeing put at risk by things like the live cattle ban. As an aside, I say that thankfully Senator Ludwig has at last, after three weeks, woken up to what destruction he had done with that stupid decision. But it is typical of the Labor government to rush in and make a decision on pink batts, live cattle or school halls. They rush in, make a decision and waste all the taxpayers' money. It is not their money. I tell you that, if it were the Labor Party's money they were spending on these schemes, they would be a bit more careful; but it is the taxpayers' money. They do not care about the taxpayers' money. It is very easy to spend other people's money, and that is what the Labor Party are doing.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">So, come Sunday, we are going to learn how the carbon tax is going to impact on us all. Today's leak was that it is not going to be 1,000 companies that pay; it is going to be only 500. How are they going to get to their targets? I would be interested to have Senator Brown tell me how they are going to halve the number of people they are going to attack and yet get the same outcome. If you are going to have this tax to pay everybody everything, as Ms Gillard is presently promisingânot that anyone would take any notice of anything Ms Gillard promisesâwhere is the money going to come from if they are going to tax only half the companies they said they were going to? The hypocrisy and the lack of truthfulness involved in this debate is absolutely mind-boggling.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">But there is one way to fix it up: let the people of Australia have a say. What could be fairer than that? What objection can you have to that? Senator Brown says it will cost $80 million. Some of the programs that the Greens raise every day would cost much, much more than $80 million. But you would be giving the Australian people a say in perhaps the greatest taxation issue since the GST.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I mention the GST because that is a good example of how to do things right. When we were in government, we talked about a GST. We brought in all the rules and procedures and the draft legislation. We said to the Australian public: 'This is what we are going to do with the GST; now we're going to an election, and if you think that we're on the right track then you'll vote for us and we'll form a government and be able to put in the GST. If you don't think it's the right thing, you won't vote for it.' Why can't the Gillard government do that? I will tell you why: the Labor Party and the Greens know that, if they asked the Australian publicâif you were at all a believer in democracyâthey would both be annihilated. The people of Australia would say, 'We don't want this tax; we don't want this imposition on our cost of living, particularly when it won't impact in any way whatsoeverâit will not have one iota of impactâon the world greenhouse gas emissions. All it will do will be to send Australian jobs overseas.' I am very distraught about the jobs up in the central Queensland area, up in North Queensland and up in Northern Australia, including the Pilbara. I am very worried about the impact the tax will have on the jobs of my fellow Australians. The Labor Party and the Greens do not care about that. They just want a tax. They want to get the money in. They have huge budget black holes. They will do anything to try to overcome their incompetÂ­ence with money.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">So I conclude by again asking Senator Brown or any of the Labor Party people who are prepared to discuss this particular bill: what is wrong with asking the Australian people what they want? What is wrong with having a plebiscite, as Mr Abbott proposes? What is wrong, indeed, with going to an election? Let us make it a double dissolution election. What could be fairer? Let us see what we in this democracy would say. But noâthe Greens and the Labor Party will join together. They will ignore the wishes and will of the Australian people and push through this horrible legislation, which will have such an impact on our cost of living and, indeed, the jobs of our fellow Australians.</span>

                      <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Senator XENOPHON</span>
                    </a> (<span class="HPS-State">South Australia</span>) (11<span class="HPS-Time">:14</span>):  I set on the record that I believe that anthropogenic climate change is real. I believe that it does require decisive and effective action. I believe that we also need to have effective policies for adaptation because the science indicatesâand there are too many good scientists who express very real concern about what will happen unless we act decisively on thisâthat adaptation also needs to be considered. I think that has not been part of the public policy debate.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I note that both the coalition and the government have similar policies in terms of reaching a five per cent target by 2020. It is just the mechanism by which they are proposing to reach those targets. The coalition has its direct action plan and the government is now proposing a carbon-pricing mechanismâI think the Prime Minister has referred to it as a carbon tax. The dilemma I have here is that the Prime Minister shortly before the last election said that there would be no carbon tax. I think it is important that, where there has been a change of government policy on an issue as fundamental as this, there ought to be an opportunity for Australians to have a say. A plebiscite would be a mechanism to do that. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The only issue I take with the opposition in relation to the Carbon Tax Plebiscite Bill 2011 [No. 2] is that the opposition must make it clear that the outcome of the plebiscite is one that the parliament ought to be bound by. If the Australian people say they do want a price on carbon, they want a carbon-pricing mechanism, to deal with climate change then the parliament ought to be bound by that. I for one believe that that is the right thing to do. Otherwise, you spend tens of millions of dollars on a plebiscite and it is very problematic if you are not bound by that.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">In a parliamentary democracy in the ordinary course of events you expect elected representatives to do their jobs. You expect elected representatives to get on with the business of dealing with legislation and dealing with important issues. That is what a representative democracy is about. We do not have in this country the mechanism they have in Switzerland or in a number of American states for so-called direct democracy, for citizen initiated referenda. We do not have that mechanism and such a mechanism can be done only via an act of this parliament. I believe that, if the electorate does not approve of decisions, you can rectify that in the ordinary course of events at the next election. That is what you expect. But, if there is a fundamental change in policy where you cannot unscramble the egg once you have put it in place, there ought to be a mechanism to allow AustraÂ­lians to deal with that issue. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">For all the criticisms I have of former Prime Minister Howard, he did do the right thing by having an election on the GST when he said previously that there would never, ever be a GST. He at least took that issue to the Australian people. The issue of the government advertising campaign to buttress his position is very problematic for me but at least there was an ability for the Australian people to decide on that. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I support the plebiscite because it is consistent with the approach I took 13 years ago when the then Liberal John Olsen government said just before the 1997 state election that they would not privatise the state's electricity assets, the Electricity Trust of South Australia, ETSA. They said it would not happen. It was a key issue of the election campaign. It was a lineball election and the Olsen government was re-elected with the support of conservative IndependÂ­ents in a minority government position. Within three months the Olsen government said they would privatise the state electricity assets because circumstances had changed. I felt then when I had a casting vote on that legislation that the only way to rectify the dilemma that the government had had in effect a reverse mandate not to sell the state's electricity assets was to have a referendum. In the end my vote did not count because two Labor members crossed the floor to vote with the government to pass that privatisation legislation.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">There is an issue here of engagement. The traditional Labor voters I have spoken to in the electorate say that they have an issue with there being a change in the policy position. Unlike members of the coalition, I do not believe that the Prime Minister lied when she said there will not be a carbon tax. I believe she genuinely believed that. I also understand that the circumstances changed by virtue of minority government. It is not a criticism of the Prime Minister for changing her position, but on something as fundamenÂ­tal as this, I think the Australian people ought to have a say.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Thirteen years ago I was heavily influenced by an article that Hugh Mackay, the social researcher and commentator, wrote called 'The lying game'. It was published in the Fairfax papersâin the <span style="font-style:italic;">Sydney Morning Herald</span> and the <span style="font-style:italic;">Age</span><span style="font-style:italic;">â</span>on 1 August 1998. It is still a very good read. He talked about the disengagement that Australians have in the political process. What Hugh Mackay said back then I think is as true or even truer today. He talked about the disconnection that Australians have with the political process. They are so disenchanted with the Australian political process. He said:</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">There are plenty of young Australians, for instance, who believe they can extract more useful informationâand possibly more "truth"âfrom an episode of Neighbours than from a news bulletin or a current affairs program. The soap, they say, is about a lot of people telling it like it is, whereas politics seems to be about a lot of people telling it like it isn't.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I think there is that disconnection and disenchantment. I think having a plebiscite would allow the Australian people to engage in this process. I have a lot of confidence in the Australian people and their judgment. Hugh Mackay said:</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">With trust in the political process being eroded with every bent principle, every broken promise and every policy backflip, the level of cynicism has reached breaking point for many Australians.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">That is what concerns me. I think engageÂ­ment on this issue by the Australian people would be a good thing, but the opposition must be bound by the will of the Australian people in relation to thisâin fact, I think the parliament ought to be bound by that.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I think the difficulty the government have is that there is a level of cynicism and disconnection amongst many of their traditional supporters. I genuinely believe that this would be a circuit breaker. Unless this occurs, whatever policy merits there may be in the government's proposalâand I do not want to pass comment on that until we see the details on Sundayâthe government will be struggling to sell its message to the Australian people by virtue of the change in policy position. Again I emphasise that I do not believe the Prime Minster was lying when she said there would not be a carbon tax. She changed her position. I respect that but I think the respectful thing to do to the Australian people is to have a plebiscite to deal with this matter.</span>

                    </a> (<span class="HPS-State">Tasmania</span>â<span class="HPS-MinisterialTitles">Deputy Government Whip in the Senate</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">11:22</span>):  I also rise to speak on the Carbon Tax Plebiscite Bill 2011, a private member's bill. I must say right from the start that this bill is an absolute sham. This bill is nothing more than an attempt to score cheap political points. We would not expect anything less from those opposite. They are led by a man who does not believe in climate change despite the evidence and despite the science.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">There used to be members of the Liberal Party who stood for placing a price on carbon, but the sceptics took over. The climate change deniers took control. In one fell swoop they turned the opposition's climate change policy on its head. Those opposite used to belong to a party that believed in climate change. Those opposite used to belong to a party that wanted to take action to cut greenhouse gas emissions. Those opposite had an emissions trading scheme as part of their policyâbut not anymore; not since the climate sceptics seized control. Those opposite have descendÂ­ed into a party focused on mindless negaÂ­tivity. The only motive that those opposite possess these days is to oppose everything and wreak havoc and destruction.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Those opposite do not seem interested in constructive policy debate and formulation. It is a real shame, because those opposite used to believe in climate change. For instance, we have heard a number of times in the debate here this morning that former Prime Minister John Howard believed in climate change and that he took a policy of an emissions trading scheme to the 2007 federal election. Former Prime Minister Howard said, 'Fundamental to tackling climate change and reducing greenhouse gas emissions is to have a price on carbon, because you cannot reduce greenhouse gas emissions unless you have a price on carbon.'</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">There are a number of senators among those opposite who also believed in placing a price on carbon, and it is disappointing that they have backed away from this commitÂ­ment. What we are left with today is an oppÂ­osition which resorts to political stunts and mindless negativity. To make matters worse, their leader, Mr Abbott, is on the record saying that, even if we waste $80 million of taxpayers' money on a glorified opinion poll, he will not necessarily accept the results. That is right; Mr Abbott is committed to pressing ahead with a plebiÂ­scite and spending $80 million even though everyone knows he will completely ignore the results. This is nothing more than an exercise in futility.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">At this point I want to quote a former senator, Senator Fielding. I have probably never quoted Senator Fielding before. I have not often agreed with him but I think he got it right on 21 June 11, when he said, in response to a question about supporting the carbon tax plebiscite bill: 'It is really just a political stuntâan expensive, glorified opinion pollâand it is not going to be binding. Tony Abbott said that even he is not going to abide by it. So it is just a total waste of taxpayers' money and I will not be involved in such a political stunt.' He said:</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">Seriously, why should we waste $80 million on a glorified opinion poll just because Tony has got a problem?</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">That was absolutely right. Spot on. Senator Fielding at that time got that completely right. It is a stunt. It is a stunt that was probably thought up on the run, as Mr Abbott is always on the run. It was a little thought bubble and it has not worked well for Mr Abbott because people have seen through it. They have seen that this is just a waste of taxpayers' money. </span>

                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We now have an opposition who come into this chamber and preach fiscal responsiÂ­bility when in fact their own actions demonÂ­strate that nothing could be further from the truth. They are fiscally irresponsible. Week after week we come into this place and are faced with private members' bills put up by members of the opposition which appropriate funds, but they fail to offset these proposed new spendings with any savings measures.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">In addition to that irresponsibility they are also blocking $6 billion worth of savings. Those opposite are all talk and no action when it comes to fiscal responsibility. Whilst those opposite continue to play political games and preach fiscal irresponsibility, we on this side of the chamber are getting on with the job of placing a price on carbon and taking action on climate change.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">As the government has made clear, this Sunday we intend to announce the full details of our carbon-pricing plan, which will help us tackle climate change and transition Australia's economy to a clean energy future. Whilst I have made contributions to similar debates in the past few days, I think it is important to recap the main features of the carbon price. The carbon price will only apply to the biggest polluters in the AustraÂ­lian economy. This means that the biggest polluters will be required to pay for every tonne of pollution they emit. As the governÂ­ment has made clear, this is the most effective and the cheapest way for us to build a clean energy economy. The government has also been steadfast that all revenue generated from the carbon price will be used to support households with assistance, to support jobs in the most affected industries and to invest in clean energy.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Our position on placing a price on carbon is in stark contrast to those opposite, who are far more interested in running a scare campaign and in political point-scoring than taking action on climate change. This is hardly surprising, considering those opposite are led by a number of well-known climate change sceptics. Mr Abbott's own climate change policy would cost $30 billion. It is taxpayers who would be left to foot the bill, rather than the big polluters. Under Mr Abbott's plan, households would not receive any assistance to cope with rises in the cost of living; instead, they will be hit with an extra $720 at tax time.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The government remain committed to putting Australian households first. We have already confirmed that more than 50 per cent of revenue raised from a carbon price will be used to assist households, with further details of the assistance package to be released on Sunday. We know already that the governÂ­ment will assist households as well as industry when the carbon price is introduced. The government have made it clear that nine out of 10 Australian households will receive some form of assistance for their household budgets. We have also said on numerous occasions that most of those seven million households will not be worse off under a carbon price. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The government are committed to ensuring that low- and middle-income earners as well as pensioners are looked after under the government's assistance package, because we know that low-income earners are the Australians who are most exposed to cost-of-living pressures. That is why we are supporting low-income earners with a 20 per cent buffer or safety net. This means that over three million households will receive an extra 20 per cent in tax cuts and payments over and above meeting the price impact of the carbon price. We also know that self-funded retirees will require support when the carbon price is introduced. That is why we will be providing financial help for around 280,000 self-funded retirees, equal to the extra payments that we will provide to over three million pensioners, part-pensioners and carers.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We know that petrol forms a big part of the household budget, so we have announced in recent years that there will be no carbon price on any fuels, including petrol, diesel and LPG, for passenger motor vehicles and light commercial vehicles. This provides another example of a deliberately run scare campaign by Mr Abbott to mislead the public. He has been running around for months trying to scare people into thinking that petrol will be part of the carbon price, and we know now that nothing could be further from the truth. In fact, Mr Abbott has claimed more than 20 times in the past four months that the cost of petrol would rise. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Recently, the Treasurer made an address at the National Press Club to highlight the benefits and opportunities presented to the Australian economy under a carbon price and, as part of his address, released modellÂ­ing from Treasury showing that, under a theoretical carbon price of $20 per tonne, the Australian economy would still grow solidly whilst also making deep cuts to carbon pollution. This modelling also showed that employment would continue to grow with the introduction of a carbon price, with Australia on track to increase national employment by 1.6 million jobs by 2020. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">As we have made clear time and again, the Labor government are committed to taking action on climate changeâevidence based, appropriate action that is in Australia's best interests. That action is a carbon price mechanism. We have opted to introduce a fixed-price phase of between three and five years to begin with, because it gives busiÂ­nesses certainty and helps them make a smooth transition to a full emissions trading scheme. It will also give businesses the time to understand how a carbon price will affect them and give them time to change their business practices so they are better prepared for the introduction of an ETS.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We know that a carbon price will result in an increase in prices; we have been upfront about this. When you introduce a market mechanism, you have to expect that the market will respond. However, as I pointed out, under the government's plan we will provide assistance to households to offset the change in prices under the introduction of a carbon priceâand, as I have mentioned, the government will not be keeping the money raised as part of the introduction of a carbon price; we will be ensuring that the money collected is used to help families and households with household bills.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The global economy is moving towards a clean energy economy. Thirty-two countries and 10 US states are already moving towards an emissions trading scheme. We cannot be left behind. We have the highest emissions per capita in the world, even higher than the United States, and for too long we have talked about taking action on climate change. We cannot delay any longer. We need to provide businesses with certainty so they can begin their transition to being part of a clean energy economy. The science behind climate change is clear: scientists are telling us that carbon pollution is causing climate change, and the government accept this science. In Australia, 2001 to 2010 was the warmest decade on record, and each decade since the 1940s has been warmer than the preceding decade. We must take action. Australia is facing huge economic costs from climate change across a range of sectors. If we do not act soon, we risk being left behind. It is essential we act now. A carbon price mechanism is essential. The carbon price will act as the primary driver of an economic transformation which will set Australia on the path towards a clean energy economy and achieve real emission reductions. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The difference between the two major parties is stark. We believe climate change is real and taking action is the right thing to do; the opposition are led by sceptics who do not believe in climate change and do not want to take real action. We want the biggest-polluting companies to pay for each tonne of carbon pollution they produce; they want to reward big polluters and make taxpayers foot the bill. We want to build a clean energy economy; they will endanger our prosperity and jobs. We want to support households and pensioners with an assistance package; they want to slug families $720 to subsidise big polluters.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The time to act on climate change is now, and that is what we will continue to do. The government believes in climate change and is committed to taking action to reduce greenhouse gas emissions by placing a price on carbon. But we are not the only ones; many economists, community leaders, businÂ­esÂ­ses and industries all believe that we need to introduce a carbon price.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">In summing up, Mr Deputy Presidentâand I congratulate the Deputy President on his appointment; I had not formally added my congratulations to the chorus of congratulations he has receivedâI urge the Senate to oppose this sham of a bill. I urge the Senate to see this bill for what it is: scare tactics and sham policy. It is a bill that would waste $80 million of taxpayers' money. Tony Abbott has not even committed to accept the outcome of a plebiscite. He must have thought this bill up while he was running around the place. I urge the Senate to oppose this bill.</span>

                      <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Senator BIRMINGHAM</span>
                    </a> (<span class="HPS-State">South Australia</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">11:39</span>):  It is an absolute pleasure to rise to speak on the Carbon Tax Plebiscite Bill 2011 [No. 2] because it is critically important. It should not be brushed off, as the Labor government is seeking to do; it should be seriously considered and it should be supported. It should be supported because there is a clear and present need for this bill to pass so as to provide a level of certainty and some opportunity for the Australian people to have a genuine, fair dinkum say on this most divisive of issues.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The Labor government, instead of fronting up to the debate around a carbon tax and engaging genuinely with the Australian people, are running scared, like a rabbit with its tail between its legs, from any proper scrutiny, proper debate and proper opporÂ­tunity to be questioned and provide decent answers to the Australian people. They are running scared from the parliamentâthe Senate and the other place, the House of Representatives. They do not want to front up and answer questions about their carbon tax in this place.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">They have been working on this carbon tax for many months, and what are they going to do now? They are going to release the details of the carbon tax two days after the parliament rises for a five-week recess rather than allow a debate to happen in this place, the people's parliament. They refuse to come into this place and answer questions on the actual detail of their scheme. For months now, they have complained about the fact that the opposition is asking questions without knowing the detail of the scheme. Time and again, we have said, 'Show us the detail. Tell us what is in this carbon tax proposal.'</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">But, no; they have resisted. They have drip-fed titbits of it to the media, preferably the Sunday newspapers, hoping to appease community concerns by putting positive spin on tiny parts of it. But they will not tell us, of course, what the carbon tax is actually going to be. They will not tell us what the rate of increase on the carbon tax will be. We know it is going to increase every single year, but they will not tell us by how much it will increase. They will not tell us clearly what is in and what is out. Instead we get a story, like we did in last Monday's newspapers, saying that petrol will be excluded. But we hear nothing when it comes to the crunch and they are asked, 'What does that mean? Will it be excluded completely? What about trucks? Will petrol be included in the carbon tax regime for the trucking industry?'</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Some senators on the Labor side are willing to speak the truth on this matter. Senator Sterle and Senator Gallacher, who I see in the chamber at present, have been willing to front up to their government and say that the carbon tax will have a devastaÂ­ting impact on the transport sector if it is applied across the board. But Senator Wong in this place and Mr Combet and Prime Minister Gillard in the other place will not actually say which parts of the transport sector it will affect. And it is not just trucks; what about passenger buses? What about public transport services? You would have thought the Greens would have a particular interest in negotiating the carbon tax around public transport services.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">There are so many unanswered questions when it comes to this carbon tax. We are told we are going to see some detail on Sunday, and I welcome that detail, but what I would welcome even more is the opportunity to be here on Monday asking questions of the government about the detail. But, no; they will not be hereâthey will not be in this place and they will not be in the other place. They will not front up and answer questions on the detail of their carbon tax in the people's parliament as they rightly should. They are running scared from the parliament. In their opposition to this bill, the Carbon Tax Plebiscite Bill, we see they are also running scared from the people. It is not just the parliament they are scared of but the people's judgment as wellâbecause all this bill would do is give the opportunity for the Australian people to have a say on the carbon tax.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Julia Gillard went to the last election solemnly promising she would not introduce a carbon tax. She said solemnly: 'There will be no carbon tax under a government I lead.' That is the most straightforward and clear-cut statement that any political leader can make in an election campaign. She made it clearly and yet she will not allow the AustraÂ­lian people to have a say on whether her justifications for breaking that promise are reasonable enough. We think the Australian people should have a say, and if they cannot have their say through another election to get this country back on the straight track then they should have their say through this plebiscite bill. That is why it should be passed.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We have a government that is running scared of the parliament and running scared of the people and that is based not just on one lie but on a series of lies. I mentioned before the monty of them all, the big one from the election campaign, 'There will be no carbon tax under a government I lead'âthe clearest statement of them all. It is the clearest statement to be so convincingly broken as it has been by this government. It did not take long. The Prime Minister claimed that she had to break the promise because of changed circumstances. That is the full extent of her justification: changed political circumstances. Because she got a minority government in the House of Representatives, that is her justification for breaking this most solemn promise. Then she came along with some of the detail around the carbon tax and said petrol will be out and it will be out foreverâexcept for the fact that we know that 'forever' in Ms Gillard's language is only until such time as circumÂ­stances change. So 'forever' is not worth terribly much when it comes from the Prime Minister's mouth. 'Forever' is obviously quite meaningless because it applies only until the circumstances change. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">But it is not just the overall 'there will be no carbon tax' statement that is the lie dogging this government; it is the process by which they go about trying to sell it. They go about trying to sell the carbon tax by arguing that somehow Australia will be left behind the rest of the world if we do not implement a carbon tax. But what did the Productivity Commission say when asked that question? The Productivity Commission report, released just last month, said very clearly:</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">â¦ no country currently imposes an economy-wide tax on greenhouse gas emissions or has in place an economy-wide ETS.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">That is a statement just about as clear-cut as, 'There will be no carbon tax under a government I lead'â'No country currently imposes an economy-wide tax on greenhouse gas emissions.' Yet this government wants to do exactly that: impose an economy-wide tax on greenhouse gas emissions. It wants to do so claiming that somehow Australia will be left behind the rest of the world if we do not do so. The Productivity Commission say the opposite. Not only do they say that nobody else does it but they also clearly say that Australia rates around 'mid-range' in terms of resources allocated to abatement and abatement achieved without there being a carbon tax. 'Mid-range' is their description of Australia's current efforts in relation to greenhouse gas reduction. As a middle power and a middle sized economy that is exactly where Australia should be.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We believe and the government itself claims to believe that Australia should be neither ahead of the world nor behind the rest of the world when it comes to reducing emissions. We should do our bit. To get too far ahead would be to place too much jeopardy on jobs in our economy and our industries. To be too far behind would be irresponsible. We should be doing our bit, and the Productivity Commission report found that we are doing our bit, that we are in the mid-range and that we are doing as we should do as a responsible global citizen. So, far from the situation of Australia not pulling its own weight, we are pulling our own weight. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The debate we have in this place and publicly is not about whether or not we should continue to pull our weight in reducing global emissions; it is about how to do so most responsibly. On this side we believe the most responsible way to do so is through an incentives driven approach. We believe that, rather than putting on an economy wide tax unlike anything anybody else in the world has, and churning billions of dollarsâit is likely to be $10, $13, $14 billionâthrough the Treasury coffers, and redistributing a whole bunch of it back, some to households, some to the Greens' pet projects and some to industry, instead you should run the country efficiently, run the budget efficiently, come up with the savings necessary and incentivise those areas of the economy that can most efficiently reduce their emissions or abate carbon. That is the best way to do itâtarget action where you can get the results rather than taxing the entire country.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We believe you can achieve the emissions reductions that are required and we believe you can do it by making the government tighten their belts and spending government dollars more wisely on emissions reduction activities rather than what Labor want to do, which is force every Australian household to tighten their belts with absolutely no guarantee of emissions reduction. Even Senator Wong has said that a carbon tax has no guarantees of emissions reduction. There is no guarantee you will get emissions reduction under a carbon tax. Even under their trading scheme it is quite possible that most of the reductions will come by purchasing permits offshore and you will get no emissions reduction in Australia. I can guarantee that under the coalition's plan you will get emissions reduction in Australia, you will get emissions abatement in Australia and it will happen at the lowest possible cost. So let us go to the people and give them a choice. Let us pass this bill and put our trust in the Australian people to decide this debate.</span>

                    </a>  There is a terribly botched process surrounding the Australian Network tender. It is a terribly botched process that is in desperate need of having some transparency applied to itâsome sunlight applied to it, as the governÂ­ment may sayâand actually giving some idea of what has gone so, so wrong. It is important to understand that there are lives hanging in the balance, in terms of jobs and livelihoods, on this. Staff of the ABC rightly want to know why this tender process has been so delayed. This is an issue that I pursued during Senate estimates. We saw absolute obstructionism from the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade at that time. Now, of course, it is clear why. Clearly they knew to some extent that they were about to be stripped of responsibility for this. Clearly they knew at the time that this process was going to be further delayed. Clearly they knew at the time that there were a number of serious problems in this regard.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This process has seen the Minister for Foreign Affairs, Mr Rudd, stripped of responsibility. Whether that is because the Prime Minister did not want the Australian Network to turn into the 'Kevin 24/7 Network', or what the process is, who knows? But we should get some transparency applied to this. We should understand whether there is a genuine concern when it comes to the conflict of interest that the Minister for Broadband, Communications and the Digital Economy may potentially have in terms of being the minister responsible for the ABC and now finding himself as the minister responsible for the Australian Network tender.</span>

                    </a>  Senator Birmingham, I have shown great patience on this occasion. I draw your attention and the attention of honourable senators to the <span style="font-style:italic;">Procedure Committee second report of 2011</span>, dated 22 June. I will quote from that:</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">

                  <span class="HPS-Small">The committee has considered the operation of standing order 66 on numerous occasions. Standing order 66(3) provides that a formal motion shall be put and determined without amendment or debate.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">

                  <span class="HPS-Small">Current difficulties are largely attributable to senators seeking leave to depart from these rules and the Senate granting leave, almost as a matter of course. In particular, the number of statements being made by leave in relation to complex motions leads to a de facto debate on those motions, contrary to standing order 66. This is because senators, instead of making statements, assert views in the nature of debate by mounting arguments and responding to positions expressed by others.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">

                  <span class="HPS-Small">... it urges senators to pay more heed to the existing restrictions. For example, if a senator wishes to amend a notice of motion, then generally, as a courtesy to the Senate, that notice should be postponed till the next day of sitting to enable the senator to use the procedures under standing order 77 to amend the notice in writing and for the notice to appear in its amended form in the next day's Notice Paper. Secondly, the committee encourages parties to use internal means to limit the number of senators seeking leave to make statements on motions to one from each group (Government, Opposition, Australian Greens).</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-State">Tasmania</span>â<span class="HPS-MinisterialTitles">Deputy Government Whip in the Senate</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">12:19</span>):  On behalf of the Chair of the Joint Standing Committee on Electoral Matters, I present the committee's report of the inquiry into the conduct of the 2010 federal election and matters related thereto, and move: </span>
              </p>

                <span class="HPS-Small">That the Senate take note of the report.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">This report continues the tradition of examining and reporting on the conduct of federal elections and relevant legislation which has been carried out by the Joint Standing Committee on Electoral Matters and its predecessor, the Joint Select Committee on Electoral Reform, since 1983.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The 2010 federal election was the first winter election since 1987, which created some challenges for the Australian Electoral Commission, the AEC, in terms of the locations to be serviced, due to the increased mobility of electors during this period. The High Court decision in Rowe &amp; Anor v Electoral Commissioner &amp; Anor reinstating the seven-day close of rolls period, and the Federal Court's decision in Getup Ltd v Electoral Commissioner regarding the use of electronic signatures, also impacted to varying degrees on the election and its conduct by the AEC. The Rowe case enfranchised almost 100,000 electors, including 57,732 new electors who would otherwise have lost their voting franchise. The decision highlighted the need to protect the democratic right of Australians to participate in choosing their representatives as provided for in the Constitution. This committee has a role to play in assisting to enfranchise eligible Australians. Making enfranchisement a priority does not mean that the integrity of the role is compromised.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The committee has made some 37 recommendations in this report to help protect the enrolment and voting franchise of Australians and to make other changes to improve the conduct of future elections. Overall, the AEC delivered a highly professional and independent service in its conduct of the 2010 federal election. However, there were regrettable incidents in the divisions of Boothby in South Australia and Flynn in Queensland where thousands of votes could not be counted due to polling official error. The committee trusts that these were mistakes which the AEC has learned from and that it will act to prevent any such occurrences in the future. The level of electoral participation at the 2010 federal election was of particular concern. AEC figures indicate that 3.1 million Australians, or 20 per cent of the eligible population, were either missing from the roll, were not marked off a certified list so presumably did not vote, or cast a vote that did not meet the formality requirements for a valid vote under the Commonwealth Electoral Act. This means that a significant proportion of eligible Australians are not exercising their franchise.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Eligible electors do have a duty to enrol for federal elections by completing an enrolment form and submitting it to the AEC and to notify the AEC of a change of addrÂ­ess. However, it is sensible to recognise the changing nature of how Australians choose to interact with government and business. People increasingly expect to be able to conduct their professional and personal business electronically and effectively. The paper form and the post box are gradually going out of fashion.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">AEC enrolment activities are necessary and must continue but they have not been effective in achieving growth in the Commonwealth electoral roll at the same rate as the growth in eligible electors. To help address this the committee supports direct enrolment and the updating of electoral details based on data received from trusted sources. This is not a panacea to the problem of the decline in electoral participation but rather another tool for the AEC to utilise when it performs the important role of its maintenance function.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Another issue the committee considered is where some eligible electors who have enrolled and believe they are on the roll turn up to vote and cannot be found on the certified list. This may be due to an error by a polling official or their having been removed from the roll as a result of the objection process the AEC is required to undertake. Electors not found on the list can cast a provisional vote. At the 2007 and 2010 elections, due to the stricter requirements introduced by the former government in 2006, even if an elector was found to be on the electoral roll, for their vote to be admitted to the count they still had to provide proof of identity on polling day or in the week following. However, those electors who had been removed as part of the AEC objection process on the basis that they were not resident at the enrolled address could not be reinstated even if they were still residing at that address.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">At elections prior to the 2006 change, after the required checks to ensure an eligible elector was duly enrolled or could be reinstated if they had been removed in error, their vote could be admitted to the count. This meant that roughly 50 per cent of provisional votes at the elections between 1996 and 2004 were admitted. However, the stricter requirements for proof of identity and the prevention of reinstatements saw the percentage of votes rejected increase to over 80 per cent. In 2010 there were 166,148 provisional votes rejected and only 37,340 admitted. In contrast, at the 2004 federal election, prior to the tightening of restrictÂ­ions, 90,366 provisional votes were rejected and 90,512 were admitted to the count. The government has since legislated to remove the proof of identity requirements that have contributed to the increased rejection of provisional votes. The committee feels that the government must go further to address this matter and enable the AEC to reinstate eligible voters to the roll if they were removed in error and also that their votes should consequently be admitted to the count.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Another matter of concern to the committee was the high number of informal votes at the 2010 federal election. The House of Representatives informality rate was 5.55 per cent, or 729,304 votes, an increase of 1.6 per cent, or 218,482 votes, on the 2007 federal election. The committee has considÂ­ered the options presented by participants to reduce the impact of informality. After careful consideration the committee has recommended the adoption of a savings provision based on that used in South Australia. The committee notes that the system has been used in South Australian House of Assembly elections since 1985 and has saved many votes which would otherwise have been informal. The committee is particularly attracted to the system because it reinforces compulsory preferential voting, prohibits advocating other than full preferential voting and is transparent in that the ticket must be lodged with the Electoral Commission and was designed by electoral administrators, not politicians. The South Australian ticket voting system, if applied to the House of Representatives ballot papers, could save a significant portion of informal votes. For the 2010 federal election this could have been as much as 42.12 per cent, or 307,156 votes, assuming that all relevant candidates had followed the appropriate procedure and lodged tickets with their preferences.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Australians expect that participation in the electoral process is accessible, convenient and does not impede their ability to go about their business. At the same time, it is fundamental to ensure accuracy, secrecy and integrity in the enrolment, voting and counting processes. These competing demands must be satisfied in such a way that the electoral process remains inclusive by preserving the high levels of integrity necessary to ensure continued trust and acceptance of election results. The committee has sought to achieve such an outcome with the recommendations made in this report.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I take this opportunity to thank my fellow committee members for their contribution to the inquiry and those who participated by making submissions or appearing at public hearings. I would also like to thank the committee secretariat for their assistance. I commend the report to the Senate.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-State">Victoria</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">12:28</span>):  I would like to begin by thanking the secretariat for the extraordinary effort in getting this report out under a very tight time line. With the changeover in the Senate and the Senate sitting this week and a number of other committee reports due, the secretariat did an extraordinary job of incorporating the changes. I think all committee members would accept that. I would like to express my personal thanks as well.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The report, as Senator Brown has outlined, is quite comprehensive. But it contains some very troubling recommendÂ­ations, and I will emphasise several of them this afternoon. What Senator Brown referred to as 'vote saving' is nothing short of vote theftâand I will go into that in more detail. I would like to highlight that it was not the committee as a whole that made this contentious recommendation; it was merely the Labor members of the committee and occasionally a Greens member of the committee as well. One of the contentious but recurring recommendations from the Labor members of the committee would effectively prohibit political parties from processing postal vote applications. There has been no demonstrated need to prohibit political parties from being able to process postal vote applications before they are forwarded to the AEC. There are no examples of people missing out on votes. There are no examples of these being withheld. It is merely something that supports the agenda of the Australian Labor Party and the Greens. In particular, there is a proposal to have only the AEC process postal vote applications and then put a list up on the website so that people like the Greens or the ALP who do not go to the trouble of trying to encourage voters to use postal votesâthose who may not be able to access a polling booth on election day or who may not be able to access a pre-poll facilityâcan see all the details of those voters on the website and the ALP or the Greens can target specific voters for their political interests. This also poses a real security risk. Do we want to be posting on a website details of people who have applied for postal votes weeks out from an election with a high correlation between applying for a postal vote and people going away? This is effectively a sign that their homes will be empty, yet there was no consideration of those issues when this was proposed and when this proposal was challenged by members of the opposition. </span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">The ALP majority have again tried to recommend what they now refer to as direct enrolment. Direct enrolment on the Australian electoral roll is by someone complying with the law and filling out a very simple form, signing it, having it witnessed and then it being placed on the electoral roll. That is the obligation of every Australian citizen and others on the electoral roll, but it is not good enough for the Labor Party. They want to be able to take data from databases like drivers licences and high schools and add people to the electoral roll automatically. They say they will check this by SMS, email or letter, but if you do not return it they will assume it is okay. Let us outline the perverse nature of this. If they send you a letter to an address they have which is incorrect, by virtue of you not returning it they will deem the address to be okayâthat it is a correct enrolment and you will be added to the electoral roll. Not only does this profoundly undermine the integrity of the electoral roll through using databases that are not fit for purpose but also this removes the paper trail we have to protect the electoral roll when there are cases of voter fraud.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">At the moment one must actually sign a form. That form is kept physically and electronically and when people use provisional or postal votes their signatures can be compared. We have had seats in this place in recent years decided by fewer votes than members of a footy team, yet the Labor Party is intent for its own purposes on conscripting people to the electoral roll using databases that are not fit for purpose and not having any process in place to ensure the integrity of the roll is retained. It is disappointing to the opposition that the Australian Electoral Commission expressed some support for that measure, because it is by its nature very contentious.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I have a couple of statistics that were highlighted in the previous opposition minority report on this issue and that we have restated today. A 1999 report by the House of Representatives Standing ComÂ­mittee on Economics, Finance and Public Administrationâthis is outlined on page 183 of the minority reportâfound that in an ANAO report there were 3.2 million more tax file numbers than people in Australia at the previous census and there were 185,000 potential duplicate tax records for individÂ­uals. Also, 62 per cent of deceased clients were not recorded as deceased in a sample match that the ANAO undertook. This is the data that the ALP wants to use to enrol people to vote. Even though people fill out much more complex forms to access Centrelink payments or vaccinations or put the kids in school, the little DL sized form that we ask people to write their name and address on and sign and have witnessed is apparently too much to get people to enrol.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">But that is not the worst proposal outlined here. What Senator Carol Brown euphemistiÂ­cally referred to as the South Australian ticket vote model is nothing short of vote theft and institutionalised fraud. Let me tell you what will happen under this. After you have been conscripted and enrolled without any choice, potentially at an incorrect addrÂ­ess, you have the right under Australian law to cast an informal ballot. We require you to turn up; we do not stand over your shoulder to make sure you cast a formal ballot. HowÂ­ever, if you decide just to tick a box knowing your vote will be informal, what the Labor Party now wants to put before the House of Representatives is that if you just mark a vote for a minority party or the Greens or an Independent, for example, that vote can then be counted according to the how-to-vote card of that particular candidate. What you callâ</span>

                  </a>  It has nothing to do with the Senate, Senator Brown, and this is the difference. For the Senate the Australian Electoral Commission are required to publish details of where those votes go. Everyone knows that when you vote '1' above the line those votes are distributed. Copies are available from the AEC at polling stations and they are on the website. They are publicly available, yet what you want to do is prohibit the people being told this is what is going to happen. At the same time as you want to count votes that are not marked on a ballot paper, you want to prohibit people from being told that is exactly what will happen. You want to make it illegal. This is institutionalised voter fraud, because you want someone to be able to mark a box and then count votes that are not on a ballot paper. We could hold these ballot papers upâwe are not talking about dimpled chads; we are talking about empty squares that you are going to count as votes for the House of Representatives. </span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">This represents a new low, even for the Labor Party. We in the opposition will oppose this with every breath in our body. If you are seriousâand I make these comments personallyâabout removing informal votes, then you move to an optional preferential voting system. An optional preferential voting system allows any mark on a ballot paper to be counted and you can tell people they can mark it with a tick, a cross, a '1' or '1', '2', '3', '4'âwhatever you choose. Yet what the Labor Party is proposing is for voters to put a tick on the ballot paper and we will count it according to what the political party in the House of RepreÂ­sentatives wants.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Accuse me of being cynical, but I think this might have something to do with the current political morass the Labor Party find themselves in. With Labor's alliance partners now sitting on the same side of the chamber, the Australian people know that the Greens-Labor governing alliance is a reality. But I think the Labor Party are concerned because what really worries them is that at the next election, just like the rest of the Australian people, their alliance partners and their voters may not be willing to follow through on the deals that people like Senator Bob Brown have made with leaders of the Labor Party. This is an attempt to grab more Greens votes where preference for the Labor Party is not expressed. Where a ballot paper is left blank of anything other than a single mark, like a '1' or a tick, what the Labor Party wants is to be able to count that. It does not pass the sniff test the Australian people will apply to free and fair elections because you cannot count votes that are not written down on paper. You cannot count a number or a preference when it has not been written down. This shows the desperate lengths to which the Labor Party will go to try to maintain an electoral advantage despite the Australian people repudiating it and its agenda.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The opposition will oppose these measures and support the others that we have outlined in a minority and dissenting report. We will oppose those measures that put the integrity of the roll at risk and that remove the duty for people to enrol personally. We will oppose the use of databases that we know are flawed. Most importantly, we will protect the integrity of the secret ballot in Australia and we will count votes when they are marked. We will not count empty squares as votes. This needs to be stopped to ensure public faith in our electoral system is maintained. I seek leave to continue my remarks.</span>

                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Senator IAN MACDONALD</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-State">Queensland</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">12:38</span>):  I was curious to hear the senator who tabled the report indicate that we were taking away the need to identify oneself to be enrolled. I have not read the report but I will read that with some interest to see what justification there could possibly be for that.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Briefly, I wanted to thank the AEC both here in Canberra and in Brisbane for their courtesy in making time to talk to me about the way electoral boundaries are drawn. I have had a particular concern about the way that the boundaries are drawn in my state of Queensland, particularly in the north. In the electorate of Herbert, which is based on Townsville, a city of 200,000 peopleâwhich is very vibrant and is going aheadâone of the almost inner-city suburbs is now part of the electorate of Dawson, which is based on the city of Mackay, some 400 kilometres south.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I know these sorts of things happen, but it is ridiculous that people who live in the suburb of Annandale in Townsville, not a couple of kilometres away from the electorate office of the federal member for Herbert, Ewen Jonesâan excellent, active, energetic and caring representativeâactually do not go to Ewen Jones for assistance in the city of Townsville; they go to Mackay, some 400 kilometres south. I know you have to get the numbers right but it does seem stupid.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">It is even more silly when you look at the seat of Dawson, which is based on Mackay and goes right up through the Whitsundays, Bowen, Ayr and Home Hill, where I live, and into the inner suburbs of Townsville. It is well represented now by Mr George Christensen. He is another very energetic, able and caring member who gets around the whole electorate. He has to do all of that. Pioneer Valley, which is five kilometres behind Mackayâand the community of interest between Pioneer Valley and Mackay is very oldâis not in his electorate. That is in the electorate of Capricornia, based on Rockhampton, which is 300 kilometres to the south. Again, five kilometres from George Christensen's office there is a part of the Mackay community that he does not represent. If that community want some assistance in federal matters they either come to me as a senator based in the general vicinityâand many of them doâor they go to Kirsten Livermore who is the Labor member for the seat of Capricornia. She is a nice enough lady but is not very active in what she does, I must say. That is why a lot of people from her electorate come to meâthey do not seem to get much assistance from the sitting member.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Again, it is a silly situation wherein she has to travel 300 kilometres through Mackay and then up the Pioneer Valley. It is compounded when looking at the town of Gracemere, which is part of the RockÂ­hampton area. It is about 10 kilometres from Kirsten Livermore's electorate office but it is not in the electorate of Capricornia; it is in the electorate of Flynnâwell represented by Mr Ken O'Dowd, a very active, able and caring member. That is about 110 kilometres from his office. It is compounded further by Flynn now taking in that part of Bundaberg, another substantial regional city, which isâdo not hold me to thisâabout 200 kilometres south of Gladstone. Mr O'Dowd looks after that whereas the member for Hinkler, Mr Nevilleâanother very active, caring and able memberâlives in the Bundaberg area but half of the major town of Bundaberg is in the electorate of Flynn based, on Gladstone.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">When you go further south, the electorate represented by Mr Warren Truss used to very capably contain Hervey Bay, which Mr Truss lives quite close to, but that is now represented by Mr Neville. Mr Truss's seat now takes in the northern sunshine tourist mecca of Noosa. That is very well represented by Mr Truss, but one wonders what the community of interest is.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I know these things are difficult, and I have raised this issue with the Joint Standing Committee on Electoral Matters and another committee and I have also raised it at estimates. I thank the AEC for explaining it to me and going through the figures with me, particularly the CEO of the AEC in Queensland. I spent some time with her. She is getting me some figures. I understand the difficulties, but anyone listening to this might be able to understand that it is unfortunate when parts of communities so close to substantial regional cities in Queensland are represented by someone who quite a way south. So I thank the AEC for explaining it to me. I know it is not their fault as such, but we really have to look at something where you can get communities of interest in situations like that which now applies in those seats up along the Queensland coast. Of course, the boundaries did not make much difference to the result. It was a fabulous result for the LNP in Queensland. All of those seats, with the exception of Capricornia, went to LNP candidates, and in Capricornia there was an eight per cent swing against the sitting member by the LNP candidate Michelle Landry, who conducted a magnificent campaign. I am not complaining that the boundaries had any particular significance, but it is just unfortunate for people in those localities to find that their local member of parliament is 200, 300 or 400 kilometres away.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Firstly, I thank the committee secretariat for the great work that they do in looking after this committee and the research that they put into it. I also want to thank the chair of the committee, Melissa Parke, and also the members of the committee. Perhaps I should not identify individuals but I do want to mention Senator Stephen Parry, who is a very keen member of that committee and brings some expertise into the operations of the committee. There are also a number of other members of that committee who have a background in law enforcement and bring great knowledge to the committee and the work that it does.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Over the last two years, the Parliamentary Joint Committee on the Australian ComÂ­mission for Law Enforcement Integrity has been conducting an inquiry into the operation of the Law Enforcement Integrity Commissioner Act 2006, fulfilling a statutory requirement within that act for such a review to occur. The final report adds to existing recommendations made in an interim report tabled in February last year. The committee is pleased that one of those recommendationsâthe addition of the Australian Customs and Border Protection Service to ACLEI's jurisdictionâhas been accepted by the government. The committee looks forward to the government's response to further recommendations we made in both the interim report and the final report.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The committee undertook a visit to Darwin and was hosted there by the Australian Customs and Border Protection Service. Mr Phil Moss, the Law Enforcement Integrity Commissioner, was also invited to come along. The committee is very appreÂ­ciative of the way they looked after the commissioner and the committee, and gave the committee a bit of an understanding of some of their roles and procedures, which is important because Customs is now part of the ACLEI process.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The committee has continued to consider the extent of ACLEI's jurisdiction, endorsing a corruption risk based approach. In essence, the committee agrees that those agencies with the highest potential corruption risk should be subject to ACLEI's oversight, ensuring the application of measures and resources that are commensurate with the corruption risk. The committee has recommended the establishment of a second tier of jurisdiction within the LEIC Act, for agencies assessed to be of intermediate risk. Whilst law enforcement agencies with a higher corruption riskâthat is, the AFP, the Australian Crime Commission and Customsâwould continue to be subject to full ACLEI oversight, second tier agencies would be subject to a more limited relationship with ACLEI. This arrangement would enable limited corruption oversight of agencies with medium corruption risk, while preserving ACLEI's effectiveness and ability to manage with the appropriate resources. ACLEI would have the opportunity to establish a relationship with medium-risk agencies with a law enforcement function, building resistance to corruption through education, awareness raising and ongoing communication. ACLEI would also develop a greater understanding of the corruption risk profile of medium-risk agencies.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Based on the evidence provided during the course of the inquiry, the committee recomÂ­mends that, at minimum, the Australian Tax Office, CrimTrac, the Australian Transaction Reports and Analysis Centre, the Australian Quarantine and Inspection Service and the Department of Immigration and Citizenship be included in a newly established second tier jurisdiction.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I am conscious that there are other members who want to speak to the report, so I will shortly be seeking leave to have the remainder of my speech incorporated in <span style="font-style:italic;">Hansard</span>. In concluding my verbal remarks, I again thank the secretariat, the committee members and the commission itself. The commission is doing a fabulous job. It is a relatively new arrangement. We have been to see the commissioner and his staff at work to get a better understanding of that. They do a fabulous job and my best wishes and congratulations go to them. Again, my thanks to the committee. I seek leave to have the remainder of my speech incorporated in <span style="font-style:italic;">Hansard</span>.</span>

                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">The committee has also proposed a relationship between ACLEI and non-law enforcement related Commonwealth agencies that capitalises on ACLEI's unique experience and understanding of corruption issues. This includes continued collaboration, with the potential, in certain circumstances, for any agency to request ACLEI's assistance in a corruption investigation. In making these recommendations, the committee has not alleged the existence of widespread or serious corruption in second-tier agencies or the broader Public Service. Commonwealth agencies take their governance and accountability requirements very seriously. However, the potential for corruption suggests the need for, at the very least, a limited relationship with ACLEI. The committee has endorsed an integrity approach that understands that, where incentives for corrupt behaviour exist, the potential for corruption cannot be ignored. For this reason, the committee continues to emphasise the need for enhanced corruption detection and prevention measures.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">In enhancing the operation of the LEIC Act, the committee has also recommended that the definition of corruption be further developed so as to provide a more detailed and comprehensive description of potential corrupt conduct for the purposes of the act. The committee considers that further definition of the term would provide greater clarity to the anti-corruption work conducted by ACLEI, while serving to more effectively delineate corruption issues from issues better handled by other agencies.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">Finally, the committee considered the large amount of evidence provided in relation to broader issues of Commonwealth-wide integrity, including suggestions for greater coordination of existing integrity agencies and the possible establishment of a Commonwealth integrity commission. While the current efforts of agencies including the APSC, the Commonwealth Ombudsman, the ANAO and ACLEI contribute to Commonwealth integrity, the committee has been left with the impression that more needs to be done.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">In conducting the inquiry, the committee received evidence that suggested the need for anti-corruption measures that extend beyond narrowly defined law enforcement functions to all public sector agencies and actors. The committee has therefore recommended that the government conduct a review of the Commonwealth integrity system, with particular examination of the merits of establishing a Commonwealth integrity commission. The committee is mindful of the need to retain ACLEI's dedicated law enforcement role in any future arrangements.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">
                    <a href="e5v" type="MemberSpeech">
                      <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Senator PARRY</span>
                    </a> (<span class="HPS-State">Tasmania</span>â<span class="HPS-MinisterialTitles">Deputy President and Chairman of Committees</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">12:52</span>):  Having been on the committee for the duration of this inquiry I also wish to make some remarks in relation to the report. I endorse the remarks of Senator Macdonald and commend the report to senators and members to read.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I want to address my remarks to one particular recommendation, recommendation 5. This recommendation has the prospect, if the government wishes to adopt it, of extending the tenure of a serving Law Enforcement Integrity Commissioner by a maximum of two years. Currently, the act provides for a five-year maximum tenure of the Law Enforcement Integrity CommissionÂ­er. I was involved with the original drafting of the bill with the then justice minister, Minister Ellison. The purpose of the five-year tenure was obvious. Someone in charge and responsible for the integrity commission could become susceptible to corruption if left in a job for a long tenure. This was one way of alleviating that potential. I think it is very healthy to have a turnover of commissioners.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">However, one thing that the original draftersâand the committee, when we startedâdid not look into thoroughly was what happens if the commission is going through a stage of expansion, as Senator Macdonald has just highlighted in relation to bringing other in other jurisdictions at a second-tier level. The commission has been growing since its inception, after the act was promulgated in 2006. However, not having that provision could restrict and severely dampen or even harm the reputation of the commission. Therefore the committee in its wisdom has decided to recommend that a further two-year tenure be allowed. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">In doing that the committee has also put some great checks and balances in place. Firstly, the minister must recommend it to the Governor-General and, secondly, the parliamentary joint committee must also approve an extended tenure of two years. I think that is a great measure, simply because if the minister of the day, for whatever reason, extended the integrity commissionÂ­er's tenureâthe minister may just decide to do that, although I know ministers look at things far more judiciously than thatâthe committee would have another right of veto. So, if the committee, with its closer involveÂ­ment with the integrity commissioner, felt that that was an inappropriate extension, the committee could veto that.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I think that lovely safety valve within the recommendation warrants the government considering this recommendation and adopting it, in the event that it may be needed. It may never be needed; however, it would be there and the commission would not suffer if we could extend the tenure of the commissioner where the circumstances warranted it. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">That is all I wish to add to the record so that people, when reading these recommendÂ­ations, have a greater understanding of the thought and the work behind that particular recommendation. I thank the Senate. </span>

                  <span class="HPS-Small">The Customs Amendment (New Zealand Rules of Origin) Bill 2011 implements changes to Article 3 of the Australia â New Zealand Closer Economic Relations Trade Agreement, commonly referred to as the ANZCERTA. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">The ANZCERTA has been a remarkable success.  It is Australiaâs longest standing bilateral free trade agreement, having been in force since 1983.  It is a wide ranging agreement that provides Australia and New Zealand with liberal access to each otherâs goods and services markets.  The World Trade Organization recognised it as âone of the worldâs most comprehensive, effective and multilaterally-compatible free trade agreementsâ. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">Australia and New Zealand provide duty free access to each otherâs goods that meet the rules of origin requirements in the ANZCERTA.  On 1 January 2007, the ANZCERTA rules of origin provisions underwent significant change to allow both the âchange in tariff classificationâ and the âregional value contentâ methods to determine origin of goods.  As part of the 2007 amendments to the ANZCERTA, both countries also agreed to conduct a review of the new rules of origin within three years of these new rules taking effect.  This review, commenced in late 2008 and completed in March 2010, resulted in changes to the text of ANZCERTA Article 3 âRules of Originâ and the related Product Specific Rules in Annex G to the ANZCERTA.  Amendments to the Customs (New Zealand Rules of Origin) Regulations 2006 will implement the changes to Annex G.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Small">The changes to the ANZCERTA, implemented domestically through this Bill and amendments to the Customs (New Zealand Rules of Origin) Regulations 2006, will reduce the administrative burden on businesses, facilitate the eligibility for duty free entry of goods into both markets, and provide greater consistency between the ANZCERTA Rules of Origin and those of other trade agreements negotiated by Australia.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Small">This Bill excludes application of the Personal Property Securities Act 2009 to the Offshore Petroleum and Greenhouse Gas Storage Act 2006 and the Offshore Minerals Act 1994.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small"> The Personal Property Securities Act 2009 establishes a single national Personal Property Security Register which, while yet to commence operation, is to become the primary register of personal property security interests throughout Australia. Commonwealth legislation, including the Offshore Petroleum and Greenhouse Gas Storage Act 2006 and the Offshore Minerals Act 1994, is not automatically affected by the Personal Property Securities Act 2009.  However, it is stated Commonwealth policy that, in order to remove duplication and increase clarity, existing approval and registration requirements for personal property securities, and dealings in these securities, are either removed from Commonwealth Acts so that Personal Property Securities Act 2009 registration requirements only will apply, or that the Personal Property Securities Act 2009 is expressly excluded from application to personal property under relevant Commonwealth Acts dealing with personal property and interests in personal property.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">Chapters 4 and 5 of the Offshore Petroleum and Greenhouse Gas Storage Act 2006 relate to registration of transfers of, and dealings in, petroleum titles and greenhouse gas titles respectively.  Chapter 3 of the Offshore Minerals Act 1994 relates to registration and dealings for offshore minerals titles.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">Under these registration requirements in the Offshore Petroleum and Greenhouse Gas Storage Act 2006, the regulator has the ability to refuse to approve a dealing in relation to a petroleum title, and the responsible Commonwealth Minister has the ability to refuse to approve a dealing in relation to a greenhouse gas title.  This ability to refuse approval and registration of an interest underpins the purpose of the registration requirement, to enable the Australian Government to ensure the suitability of the entities that potentially are able to exercise control over the exploitation of Australiaâs offshore petroleum resources. There is no such approval mechanism contained in the Personal Property Securities Act 2009 as a precursor to registering an interest on the Personal Property Security Register. By not excluding the Offshore Petroleum and Greenhouse Gas Storage Act 2006 from the Personal Property Securities Act 2009, the situation could conceivably arise whereby a dealing refused under the Offshore Petroleum and Greenhouse Gas Storage Act 2006 could in fact be registered in the Personal Property Security Register â which could lead to legal confusion over the standing of the security interest.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">Further to this, State and Northern Territory governments have advised the Commonwealth that they are electing to opt out of or exclude the operation of the Personal Property Securities Act 2009 for their onshore mining schemes.  </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">Therefore excluding application of the Personal Property Securities Act 2009 to the Offshore Petroleum and Greenhouse Gas Storage Act 2006 and the Offshore Minerals Act 1994  is important to ensure consistency between the onshore and offshore mining regimes, and minimise a potential regulatory burden and costs to the mining industry and its investors in complying with different registration requirements, potentially skewing investment between onshore and offshore, and having to keep abreast of developments. </span>

The level of these fees will be subject to a full cost recovery impact statement, to ensure they are consistent with the Australian Government Cost Recovery Guidelines and provide increased transparency and the true cost of regulating the offshore oil and gas industry. </span>

A further cost recovery impact statement process will be undertaken in the second half of 2011 to determine NOPTAâs and NOPSEMAâs ongoing operating costs in regulating after 1 January 2012.   </span>

                      <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Senator FIFIELD</span>
                    </a> (<span class="HPS-State">Victoria</span>â<span class="HPS-MinisterialTitles">Manager of Opposition Business in the Senate</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">13:00</span>):  I rise to speak on the Child Support (Registration and Collection) Amendment Bill 2011. This bill makes minor amendÂ­ments to the Child Support (Registration and Collection) Act 1988 to allow the Child Support Registrar to delegate powers that would permit the outsourcing of particular services, such as debt collection. It also amends a number of criminal penalty provisions to help ensure successful prosecution where wrongdoing is found and to underpin the integrity of the Child Support Scheme.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The Child Support Agency is required to collect outstanding child support debts; that is part of their core business. At present there are a range of ways that the CSA can recoup outstanding debts from parents who refuse to pay child support. This bill will expand the avenues that the Child Support Registrar can pursue for debt collection. In particular, it will allow the registrar to outsource debt collection activities to specialised debt collection services. Centrelink already has an existing capacity to outsource to specialist debt collector services, but this bill will give the Child Support Registrar similar powers. This measure is designed to increase the successful collection of child support liabilities owed by parents who have refused to pay.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Item 5 of the bill is intended to make clear that an employer who fails to deduct child support from an employee's pay when required to do so has committed an offence. The government has said that this measure is designed to correct an ambiguity in the legislation which did not make it clear that an employer could commit an offence by failing to withhold pay when required to do so. The government has indicated that a literal interpretation of the provision suggests that an employer could be penalised for complying with the section as it is currently drafted. This makes prosecution difficult. The bill clarifies that an employer is strictly liable for failing to act appropriately when required to do so. This should enhance the prospect for success of prosecution when there is wrongdoing.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Importantly, the government has indicated that the Commonwealth Director of Public Prosecutions has been consulted in the drafting of the proposed amendments and, given that the bill makes a number of technical amendments which appear to enhance the operation of the Child Support Agency and registrar, the coalition will not be opposing the bill.</span>

                      <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Senator SIEWERT</span>
                    </a> (<span class="HPS-State">Western Australia</span>â<span class="HPS-MinisterialTitles">Australian Greens Whip</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">13:03</span>):  As Senator Fifield pointed out, the Child Support (Registration and Collection) Amendment Bill 2011 amends section 15 of the Child Support (Registration and Collection) Act, allowing, amongst other things, the registrar to delegate his or her powers to persons engaged by the Commonwealth. There were some concerns expressed to me about this particular bill because it permits the outsourcing of child support payment debt collection, which is normally carried out by the Child Support Agency.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Debt collection work that is done by the CSA is very complex. They are dealing with quite complex family matters, and CSA workers provide advice about tax obligations and Centrelink entitlements, which assist parents in ensuring that their children are adequately provided for. CSA employees also have access to complex and confidential information, including court orders, which may contain activation clauses for the repayment of debt and they also mitigate debt repayments and negotiate alternatives if one parent finds themselves without an income. In other words: they play a very sensitive role. It is a highly skilled role, dealing with parents and negotiating and facilitating between parents in some cases. It is sort of like that.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">There has been some concern expressed to me that private providers would not have the knowledge of Human Services and the depth of training that I know CSA provides to be able to provide this level of advice, and we believe they should not have access to sensitive information. We raised these concerns with the minister, Minister Plibersek, and I wrote her outlining some concerns. I am very pleased to say that Minister Plibersek responded; we have met with officers and got a briefing on this legislation. I put on the record that I very much appreciate that. I also acknowledge that the agency has been doing a lot of work in developing its processes, particularly around debt collection, and I understand there has been a significant improvement in the debt that has been recouped.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I would like to acknowledge the fact that the minister has written back addressing the issues I raised with her office; I thank her for that. She has indicated in the letter that outsourced providers will provide staff with limited specialised skills to be used in particular circumstances. As I said, they will be used only in very particular circumÂ­stances. I understand why, in particular circumstances, it may be advantageous to outsource that process.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The minister also outlined that outsourced debt collection will complement the Child Support Agency's existing compliance tools and will only be used when CSA staff have exhausted all avenues for collection. Importantly, she also committed to consult with staff and the CPSU on plans for implementation of the legislation, including the nature and scope of any proposed outsourced work as specified in a delegation instrument. As I said, I appreciate that very much. That reply deals adequately with the concerns we raised. I understand that the minister will be confirming these responses on record in here. I thank the government for their response. I do understand this is a sensitive issue. I think they have handled our concerns sensitively and because of that we will now be supporting this legislation.</span>

                    </a> (<span class="HPS-State">South Australia</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">13:07</span>):  I will confine my remarks to an amendment that I will be moving; I think it is important to refer to it in the second reading stage. My primary concern about this bill relates to any potential to offshore the information that will be obtained by virtue of these changes. I acknowledge and support the government's intentions in this bill and I agree that granting the registrar the powerâfor example, to utilise a debt collector to retrieve unpaid amountsâwill help to streamline operations. However, we need to make sure that the third parties who act under the registrar's delegated powers treat any information they receive appropriately.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I have spoken previously about my concerns with the 'big 4' banks sending personal information offshore for processing. A survey I commissioned, along with the Finance Sector Union, in 2009 shows that 91 per cent of Australians would choose a bank that did not send their personal information overseas. A further 83 per cent of people believe that banks should get written permission before sending personal information offshore. So there is a concern that when you are dealing with sensitive information it should not be sent offshore. There are concerns about the security of that information. It is much better to keep it onshore. It is good in terms of the personal and financial security of Australians and it protects Australian jobs.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I am grateful for the discussions I have had with Minister Plibersek's office in relation to this and for the government's willingness to support this amendment. I would urge all my colleagues to do so. It is a fairly straightforward amendment. I note that during Senate estimates when I asked questions of the Australian Taxation Office on their debt-collecting proceduresâtheir outsourcing of debt collectionâthey said, categorically, they do not offshore that information. It is important that there are guarantees this does not occur here with this particular department.</span>

                    </a> (<span class="HPS-State">Queensland</span>â<span class="HPS-MinisterialTitles">Parliamentary Secretary for Disabilities and Carers</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">13:09</span>):  I thank senators for their contribution to the debate on the Child Support (Registration and Collection) Amendment Bill 2011. The first section of the bill will enable the Child Support Registrar to delegate powers and functions to external service providers. The bill will also allow the Child Support Program to consider the use of contracted staff to undertake specific and limited jobs. The core work of the Child Support Program requires skilled work by staff who have a wide knowledge of child support matters. The minister and I are absolutely certain that no contracted service provider would be able to provide staff with this range of skills and depth of knowledge. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The bill will not be used to outsource the core work of the Child Support Program and will not be the basis of job cuts within the program. External service providers may be able to provide staff with more limited but specialised skills that could be used in specific circumstances. For example, a forensic accountant may be used to discover hidden assets belonging to parents with a child support debt. This will allow highly skilled and valued staff to concentrate on what they do bestâhelping Child Support Program customers and their children. This bill will also allow the Child Support Program to use external debt collectors, in limited circumstances. This approach is currently used by Centrelink and the Australian Taxation Office.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The government wants to ensure that the Child Support Program has every tool available to collect unpaid child support debts. Debt collection activities will enhance the Child Support Program's existing comÂ­pliance tools. In the first instance, the Child Support Program works with paying parents to encourage voluntary payments of child support. The engagement of a debt collection agency will only occur where Child Support Program staff have exhausted all avenues for collection and have been unable to identify any further opportunities. These delegation powers are already available to Centrelink. It is important that each agency in the newly-integrated Department of Human Services have the same powers. For example, if one person has both a Centrelink debt and a child support debt, it makes no sense that a debt collection agency would collect one part of the debt and not the other.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The outsourced services will be clearly specified in the delegation instrument, issued by the registrar as well as in guidelines provided to the contract service provider when they are engaged. The Child Support Program will consult with staff and the CSU on plans for implementation, including the nature and scope of any proposed outsourced work as specified in the delegation instruÂ­ment. I can assure the Senate that adherence to the Australian Public Service values and code of conduct by the service-provider staff would be an essential requirement and would be specified in any contractual arrangements. I can also confirm that any outsourcing will occur in line with Commonwealth procureÂ­ment guidelines and will be subject to review, as per contractual arrangements.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The second section of the bill relates to certain obligations on an employer to deduct and remit child support payments to the Child Support Program. The current offences relating to 'employer withholding' are written in a way which is ambiguous. The proposed bill will make it clear that it is an offence when an employer fails to take a certain action. This will improve the prospect of successful prosecution of employers who fail to deduct or remit child support payments for the benefit of children. I say, for the record, that the government will support Senator Xenophon's amendment and I commend the bill to the Senate.</span>

                    </a> (<span class="HPS-State">Western Australia</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">13:16</span>):  The coalition will not be opposing the Financial Framework Legislation Amendment Bill (No. 1) 2011. This bill amends eight acts across five portfolios. Its purpose is to update and clarify the Commonwealth's financial framework and to amend and improve the governance and financial arrangements of existing governÂ­ment bodies. This bill represents the eighth financial framework legislation amendment bill since 2004. It is part of an ongoing commitment, by whoever has been in government, to address financial framework issues as they arise and as related to financial management provisions, governance strucÂ­tures and legislative anomalies. The explanÂ­atory memorandum to this bill states that these amendments will have no financial impact, which we accept. It goes on to say that the changes 'may lead to productivity gains', which the coalition would of course welcome.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Specifically, this bill seeks to improve the readability of the Commonwealth AuthoriÂ­ties and Companies Act 1997, the so-called CAC Act, by transferring the detail relating to the corporate plans of government business enterprises into the Commonwealth Authorities and Companies Regulations 1997. It also seeks to improve the readability of the Financial Management and AccountÂ­ability Act 1997 by clarifying its interaction with the Legislative Instruments Act 2003. Various amendments are also made to six other acts and are said to reflect best practice. These include making consequenÂ­tial amendments to the Legislative InstruÂ­ments Act as a result of the FMA Act changes outlined earlier and updating the Wheat Export Marketing Act 2008. There are also amendments to the Wine Australia Corporation Act 1980 to update the circumstances for the provision of its annual operational plan to the responsible minister, as well as clarifying the allowable term in officeâa three-year maximumâof members of a related committee, the Geographical Indications Committee, thereby removing an anomaly whereby some appointees could serve indefinitely. The amendments also update a reference in the Renewable Energy (Electricity) Act 2000 to the âAustralian Bureau of Agricultural and Resource Economics and Sciencesâ, or ABARES, previously ABARE, and repeal a redundant reference to the Science and Industry Research Act.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">As I mentioned, the coalition will not be opposing this bill. We do think, though, that it is a missed opportunity in the context of NBN Co., which could do with some serious improvements to its corporate governance and financial arrangements. While there are some specific proposals which will go towards improving the efficient operation and governance of entities such as Wheat Exports Australia, albeit in small way, NBN Co. is the one government business enterÂ­prise where proper government oversight is sadly lacking. The NBN Co. annual report states that the company regularly reports to its shareholder ministers; what that means, we do not really know. The Minister for Finance and Deregulation as joint shareÂ­holder minister should of course have a very close watching brief over its activities; however, the coalition are not confident that this is presently the case. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This entity, NBN Co., will churn through taxpayers' dollars at an alarming rate. We recently saw the deal between the governÂ­ment, NBN Co. and Telstra formalised, which will cost taxpayers billions of dollarsâa deal that will kill off fixed-line competition and create a new government monopoly. We also know that NBN Co. has already signed contracts worth $7 billion. Who knows if these contracts will produce value for money? What real incentive is there for this company to achieve value for money? Under this government, NBN Co. is under no pressure whatsoever to run a tight ship, and this legislation would have been a good opportunity to address that.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The government itself has set a dreadful example for any government business enterÂ­prise when it comes to achieving value for money for taxpayers. It is quite extraordinary that not one but two finance ministers could endorse taxpayer-funded spending on this scale without a cost-benefit analysis. Yet we know that, in the budget, $18.2 billion of taxpayers' money or money borrowed in the name of the taxpayer will be pumped into this high-risk venture. The fact that this has been permitted to happen under the existing financial framework does indeed sound alarm bells for the coalition, as it should for people right across Australia. As I said at the outset, we will not be opposing this bill, but it does highlight that the financial framework is currently still inadequate in that it can allow a government business enterprise like NBN Co. to operate in the inadequate way that it is operating.</span>

The Financial Framework Legislation Amendment Bill (No. 1) 2011 is an omnibus bill that will amend eight acts across five portfolios to help further clarify aspects of the Commonwealth's financial framework. The bill amends the CommonÂ­wealth Authorities and Companies Act 1997 and the Financial Management and Accountability Act 1997 to improve the core financial legislation. Outside the Finance and Deregulation portfolio, changes are also made to the Legislative Instruments Act 2003, the Wheat Export Marketing Act 2008, the Wine Australia Corporation Act 1980, the Renewable Energy (Electricity) Act 2000, the Primary Industries (Excise) Levies Act 1999 and the Science and Industry Research Act 1949.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">It is important to put this in perspective. I was approached about a year ago by Emanuel Skorpos, who is a proprietor of Flinders Run estates, a small boutique winery in the southern Flinders Ranges in South Australia. It is a small and growing business, and he produces excellent wines that have been highly rated. He received information that his wine labels were being counterfeited in China. His initial experiences with Wine AustraliaâI think it was called the Wine and Brandy Corporation thenâwere less than satisfactory. At his own expense he had to go to China to establish that the wine labels were indeed being counterfeited. There were some small variations, but effectively wines were being passed off as his. There has been subsequent confirmation that the wines were not Australian wines. As I understand it, in fact they were counterfeit wines.</span>

                    </a>  Madam Temporary Chair, I am suitably chastised by you. But I just could not resist that. This is not an onerous amendment. This amendment will simply require that, in the corporate plan they are obliged to provide, Wine Australia make reference to the issue of the monitoring and preventing of the counterfeiting of Australian wines within and outside Australia. The amendment is not mandating what action they have to take but it does mandate that they have to pay attention to it to the extent that they need to say what they are or are not doing in relation to the counterfeiting of wine.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This is a major issue. We know that the risk of tainted wine, for instance, which is at much higher risk with counterfeit wine, can have a devastating effect on a wine industry. The Austrian wine industry was affected a number of years ago, and it took them a number of years to recover from that. It is the integrity of the labels. It is essential that our wines be protected from counterfeiting. The experiences of Mr Skorpos in relation to his Flinders Run estates label are quite salutary. I think it is fair to say that Wine Australia has certainly improved lines of communication and they have been open with Mr Skorpos in relation to this. But the key issue is: what is wrong with requiring Wine Australia to say, 'This is what we're doing as part of our corporate plan in relation to counterfeiting'? </span>

The Winemakers Federation of Australia does not support the amendment that Senator Xenophon has proposed. It is concerned about the precedent that would be established by having a member of parliament dictate the activities and functions of an industry funded body beyond that set out in the enabling legislation for the statutory nature of the organisation. In the view of the federation, the governance and the autonomy of the corporation board could be compromised. It is an unnecessary interference in the role of the corporation. </span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">It is a statutory corporation with the power to manage its own affairs. The corporation's corporate plans and annual operational plans are developed by the corporation, approved by its board and agreed by the minister. The board is accountable to industry levy payers through the publication and distribution of its annual report and at the industry annual general meeting. Levy payers have not used this mechanism to indicate discontent with or request changes to the activities and priorities of the corporation to date.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The corporation is funded by a mixture of levies and user-pays funding. The levies are collected for marketing and promotional activities, while the user-pays elements fund the export approval and label enforcement aspects of the corporation's work. The federation has advised that, in its view, there is not a sufficiently compelling case for the industry at large to fund the protection and prosecution of individual companies from counterfeiting activity in other nations. Intellectual property rights are private rights and breaches should be handled by businesses themselves. Not all companies affected by counterfeiting want government involvement and would prefer to deal with protection of their intellectual property rights themselves. We are aware of instances where the private rights holders have actively discouraged government or corporation involvement in investigating and enforcing their rights.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Once wine is exported from Australia, it becomes subject to the importing countries' rules and regulations and is outside the control of Australian authorities. This includes wine labelled as Australian wine when it is not Australian wine. If a wine is produced and bottled overseas, Australian authorities have no means to prevent that product being incorrectly labelled. ThereÂ­fore, we are not sure how Wine Australia would prevent the counterfeiting of AustÂ­ralian wines outside of Australia and are cautious about recommending the corporaÂ­tion be given or appear to be given a responsibility that it has no means of carrying out.</span>

I note that Senator Xenophon is undertaking ongoing discussions with Minister Ludwig that, hopefully, will reach a point that addresses the issue he has raised. But, on the basis of my contribution, we cannot support your amendment today.</span>

It is not something that the coalition thinks that the parliament should prescribe through this legislation.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">If we start prescribing one issue that might have merit, obviously the question then arises: what about all these other issues that we might feel are necessary and important to deal with? It is quite appropriate for us to leave the consideration of, and decision making around, the strategic and operational direction of Wine Australia to the Wine Australia organisation. On that basis, the coalition will not be supporting this amendment.</span>

To clarify: Margaret River is a renowned winegrowing region. I still maintain my position that South Australian wines are the best, but I can disclose that, whilst I normally only buy South Australian wines, I did buy a Margaret River wine called Devil's Lair to give to Senator Heffernan, which he appreciated.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The point being missed here is that the issue of counterfeiting of Australian wines, particularly in some of the emerging markets, can have a potentially devastating effect on the integrity of our wine industry. This amendment does not say, 'You must take these steps in relation to counterfeiting.' It asks, 'What will you be doing in relation to this?' I do not think it dictates activity, as the Winemakers Federation suggests. If you look at the role and mission of Wine Australia, its core responsibilities include export regulation and compliance and domestic and international wine promotion. On the basis of those two areas alone, what could be more important than ensuring the ongoing promotion of our wines overseas than to ensure the integrity of the labels and their protection from counterfeiting?</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I understand what the government and the opposition are saying, but I would like the government and the opposition to indicate, given that they acknowledge the problem of counterfeiting of Australian wines, particularly in overseas markets, whether they are generally supportive, without being locked into the wording of the amendment, of the need for a Senate committee inquiry into this area so that these issues of intellectual property and the like are at least ventilated.</span>

I understand the numbers are very much against me. This is an important issue, which I think has been acknowledged fairly by both sides. I will be moving in the next sitting week for specific terms of reference in relation to the issue of counterfeiting and, in good faith and with goodwill, I will negotiate with the government, the opposition and my crossbench colleagues to try to get that inquiry up because it is an important issue that needs to be dealt with.</span>

As we are well aware, the tankers are getting bigger and bigger and, because we are having to deal with the greater size of the tankers, we are getting more of this thing called ship-to-ship transfer of oil. As such, we have to start regulating and making sure that we have the proper protocols in place so that we do not create an environmental problem.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We have really had only had one experiÂ­ence so far in Australia of these large ship-to-ship transfers, and that was by Caltex. Not for one moment do we suggest that Caltex are not doing a good jobâthey are. This is just a regulatory measure and it brings us into line with the protocol on the prevention of pollution from ships at sea, MARPOLâthe International Convention for the Prevention of Pollution from Ships.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We have dealt with this on a number of occasionsâI think this might be the sixth time that we have been engaged with this actâand it has always been on a bipartisan basis. This is not to do with all ships. As I think has been noted, it is generally ships greater than 150 tonnes dead weight. As such, it requires that as a person goes through areas, there is a process of notificaÂ­tionânotifying people that you are going to do a ship-to-ship transferâand an operations plan is required to be in place. That operations plan has to be signed off that it has been submitted so that it is properly concurred with.</span>

                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This is bill is noncontroversial. It was introduced in the other place, and I have had a quick read over the speech by the member for Gippsland, who at that time was repreÂ­senting the shadow minister, Warren Truss. As I said, this is noncontroversial, and I hope that we can deal with this expediently.</span>

One of the greatest threats to the marine environment, as we all knowâparticularly those of us from North Queenslandâis a major oil spill. This bill continues the government's persistent efforts to protect the marine environment by setting out measures to be adopted when oil that is being carried as cargo is transferred between oil tankers. The amendments in this bill reflect international best practice. I thank Senator Joyce for his contribution and I commend the bill to the Senate.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">We have achieved an agreement with industry about how international standards will be operationalised, and now we are also confident the number of exporters in Australia are ready to meet those standards. We have also received advice from the Indonesian counterparts that they are prepared to issue import permits for the importation of live cattle. Strict new conditions, though, have been written into all export permits that will allow the export of live cattle only when animals can be managed through the supply chain to meet those international guidelines which I spoke of.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">These conditions require exporters to trace cattle from properties onto vessels, into feedlots, and from feedlots into slaughterÂ­houses at the agreed international standard. Permits will only be issued to those exporters who can demonstrate that this will in fact be the case. Exporters will have to collect and make public the data on the individual consignments that they take to market, including where animals are fattened, how they are transported and where they are slaughtered.</span>

What that means is that these audits will be made public. So you will have international auditors who audit the particular supply chain, including the end at the abattoir, to ensure that they meet those supply chain assurances, that they meet animal welfare outcomes, that they ensure that animals are not mistreated throughout that supply chain, and that audit by the independent auditor will be available publicly. <span style="font-style:italic;">(Time expired)</span></span>

What we had up to the point of the suspension was a self-regulated industry that clearly had failed animal welfare outcomes. There is no question that they had not met animal welfare outcomes that the community would expect. Those on the other side would want the trade to continue without managing animal welfare outcomes. What the suspension allowed to happen was that we could put in place a supply chain assurance which includes traceability, transparency and independent auditing as a vital part of the overall supply chain to ensure animal welfare outcomes, to ensure that we could meet internationally agreed norms of OIE guidelines, to ensure that these cattle exported from Australia would not be mistreated and that each individual consignÂ­ment would be able to be tracked into the abattoir to ensure animal welfare outcomes. Prior to that, there was no guarantee. <span style="font-style:italic;">(Time expired)</span></span>

When will the trade resume? Industry is now able to apply for export permits and once their applications can demonstrate that they can meet the conditions we expect the permits will be issued. In addition, I am advised that the Indonesian government will now issue import permits which are necessary for the trade to recommence. This is the first important step in recommencing this trade and getting it up and running as quickly as possible. That is the best form of outcomeâ</span>

I know that she is particularly passionÂ­ate about telecommunications services in rural and regional New South Wales. The Gillard government has pledged that no community in Australia will be left behind in the rollout of affordable, modern, high-speed broadband. Sadly, some of those opposite, particularly down in the far corner, claim to represent the interests of country and regional Australia but, in truth, they simply pay lip service to the view, continually opposing the Gillard government as we roll out uniform wholesale pricing and ubiquitÂ­ous high-speed broadband to 100 per cent of Australian premisesâa project that will have a particularly dramatic impact on regional Australia.</span>

The interim satellite service offers metro-comparable speeds to underserved Australians at affordable prices, with retail service providers having announced packages starting at around $40.

                  </a>  I am aware of the question, because the question which I am answering is thisâif those opposite have been listening for some time. But they are closed to the answer, because the answer is that the export permits now have a regulatory regime in place. When an exporter requests a permit, comes forward and can demonstrate they meet those requirements, then the permits will be issued and they will be able to use their Indonesian permits, and the trade will recommence. It is a clear process. Those opposite, of course, would want the trade to recommence without the supply chain assurance and without safeguards that animals will not be mistreated as we saw on that video on <span style="font-style:italic;">Four Corners</span>. What those opposite are arguing for is an immediate resumption of the trade from day one, or a continuation of the trade. What this government has put in place is a supply chain assurance which demonstrates that we have tracking, transparency and independent auditing of that supply chain so that people such as Elders or Wellard, who are near ready as I am informed, can come forward to the departmentâto the regulatorâand have the supply chain assurance conditions met. When they are met, they will then be able to recommence the trade. It is a simple proposition. It is difficult to see why the opposition do not understand that, but it is a simple proposition: as soon as Elders, Wellard or other companies want to seek an export permitâ <span style="font-style:italic;">(Time expired)</span></span>

What has been occurring is that the Minister for Trade, the Minister for Foreign Affairs and I have been working diligently to recommence this trade as quickly as possible. The Prime Minister and I have consistently said that we would not wait one moment, when we did not have to, to recommence the trade. As soon as the industry working group had finalised the draft standards, Indonesia had indicated that it was ready to meet the OIE guidelines, the standards were in place, the export control permits were in placeâwhen all of those had come together late yesterday afternoon, I was not going to wait one moment to let the trade recommence as quickly as it can. Those opposite would want us to delay. Those opposite would want us to continue without starting the trade.

The Greens welcome the government's support for CASA's moves to protect the safety of passengers by grounding Tiger Airways. In light of this, however, the airline continued to sell tickets for five days, including bookings for flights in the month of July which have subsequently been cancelled. What action will the government take to stop Tiger or any other carrier from doing this in the future?</span>

I am sure all senators and those listening are aware that Tiger Airways Australia was banned from flying by the Civil Aviation Safety Authority, CASA, with immediate effect on 2 July on the basis of serious and imminent risk to air safety. CASA announced on 6 July that it will apply to the Federal Court to extend the ban until 1 August 2011 on the basis it needs more time to investigate the operations of the company.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Initially the company continued to sell tickets to consumers for flights to commence from the end of the initial ban period, being Saturday, 9 July. Both the ACCC and the state and territory consumer regulators did take prompt action under Australia's new Consumer Law. They contacted, spoke to and informed the company to notify it that selling tickets to consumers without a reasonable expectation of being able to provide services would amount to a contravention of Australia's Consumer Law. As I said, this is new national law; it was introduced from 1 January this year. It does highlight single national law: we were able to see with regard to this matter prompt, nationally consistent actionâand I emphasise nationally consistent actionâwhich may not have been possible under previous legislation. So I think it does illustrate that the new national Consumer Law can operate effectively. <span style="font-style:italic;">(Time expired)</span></span>

I would like to ask whether the minister is aware that on Tiger Airways' website it states that passengers who have bought tickets for flights between now and 31 July will be refunded. However, when you look at the website, there is absolutely no information as to how to apply for that refund. Is the government doing anything to ensure that customers and passengers do get their money back in a timely manner?</span>

It offered to refund moneys to passengers for all flights up to and including 31 Julyâthe date to which you referâand offered its sincerest apologies to consumers. I am not aware and I have no advice as to what is on the website, but obviously, consistent with the need to provide a refund of moneys, Tiger Airways would need to ensure there is actually a channel for those moneys to be collected. Firstly, though not having read the website and having no notification in the brief before me, I am sure that the chairman of the ACCC as well as the state and territory consumer regulators will ensure that there is a channel for refund moneys owed to consumers to be promptly refunded. <span style="font-style:italic;">(Time expired)</span></span>

Passengers have told the ABC that they did not know their Tiger flight was cancelled due to safety concerns until questioned by journalists once they reached the airport. Given airlines ask passengers for their email addresses and phone numbers before completing their booking, what measures are the government taking to ensure that passengers get informed quickly that their flight is seriously delayed or cancelled due to safety concerns?</span>

Regarding the issues you have raised about notification to customers, I do not have advice as to whether or not they would fall within those matters that would come under the surveillance authority regulatory oversight of the Civil Aviation Safety Authority. In today's world, however, you would expect that an airline flying in this country, given the data that they collect and systems they need to operate, could, and indeed should, be able to notify passengers promptly using what would be regarded in today's world as reasonable, up-to-date, efficient and speedy methods of communiÂ­cation. I think that it would be perfectly reasonable. <span style="font-style:italic;">(Time expired)</span></span>

They will be decisions taken by this government and no doubt she will be doing media in explaining the government's position on that day. As to the details, Senator, I think that you and I will both have to wait to see exactly how that occurs. You do know that there is a government lock-up for journalists and other associations. That will occur and, as I say, the Prime Minister will announce the government's position in relation to the future pricing of carbon.</span>

The Fair Work Act replaces over 100 years of fragmented workplace relations law with a predicted net benefit to Australian business of around $4.8 billion over the next 10 years. Also, all the indicators released so far show that the Fair Work Act is working well. Modern awards have been successfully implemented, creating huge savings for industry in terms of simplification and cutting red tape, and, as we know, industrial disputes are down, the number of agreements made is up and wages growth remains moderate and contained. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Unfortunately, not everyone is reaping the benefits of our national workplace relations system. Only one state prevents a truly national system becoming a reality. Businesses and workers in Western Australia still have to deal with the red tape and inefficiencies of working in two systems. However, the future for Western Australian business is looking brighter after a significant barrier was lifted yesterday. Yesterday, Premier Barnett announced the shelving of the radical agenda recommended by the Amendola report into Western Australia's workplace relations system. He decided to abandon the Work Choices approach, and the good thing about that, apart from the Liberal Party in Western Australia coming to their senses, is that there is now nothing standing in the way of Western Australia referring their workplace relations powers to the Commonwealth and enjoying the benefits that the Fair Work Act has created for the rest of the country. They can join the national system. They can take the advice of the Western Australian Chamber of Commerce and Industry and the advice of business, and refer their powers to the Commonwealth and allow us to create one national industrial relations system, which this country has been chasing for many years now. It would be a great decision if Western Australia decided to refer their powers. <span style="font-style:italic;">(Time expired)</span></span>

This is implementing the historic agreement signed by all Australian governments to create a national occupational health and safety framework, replacing the nine different acts and over 400 pieces of regulation. Other governments are moving to implement the harmonised laws: Queensland and New South Wales have passed legislation, South Australia and the ACT have introduced bills and the others are in the process of introducing bills.</span>

However, the WA government has indicated that it intends to depart from the agreed model in several ways. This is despite the fact that all other states committed to introduce uniform laws, and it has the potential to undermine one of the most important reforms on the COAG agenda. <span style="font-style:italic;">(Time expired)</span></span>

How can you be so hypoÂ­critical? Those in that corner have a glass jaw on this.

                    <span class="HPS-MemberAnswer">Senator CHRIS EVANS</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-State">Western Australia</span>â<span class="HPS-MinisterialTitles">Minister for Tertiary Education, Skills, Jobs and Workplace Relations and Leader of the Government in the Senate</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">14:47</span>):  I thank the Senator for his question and acknowledge it is his first question in this place. I am advised that the CommonÂ­wealth typically spends between $80 million and $90 million on ADF clothing per year. It is sourced from approximately 220 suppliers. I am also advised that approximately 99 per cent of the clothing suppliers for the ADF are Australian companies. The work they do is crucial to ensuring every member of the ADF has the equipment they need to do their job. It is also good for Australian jobs and the Australian economy that so much of the work is done in Australia.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">About the specifications for defence clothing and equipment: as senators will understand, the specification for clothing and equipment used by the ADF change regularly. I am advised that defence has in excess of 1,000 technical specifications for items of combat and non-combat clothing. They change when the needs of our ADF change and they change when there are improvements in the technology of product designers and manufacturers. This is particularly important as the threats faced by our troops are constantly evolving.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">For this reason, defence has recently set up a new team called Diggerworks, which includes a number of soldiers who have recently returned from operations in the Middle East and also defence scientists and engineers. The team is led by Colonel Jason Blain, who is the commanding officer of Mentoring Task Force 1 and who returned from Afghanistan early last year. Their job is to test, evaluate and prototype new clothing and personal protective equipment for our soldiers to make sure they have what they need to do their difficult and dangerous work. I think those arrangements go a long way to addressing some of the concerns that have been expressed in the past by ADF personnel about their clothing and equipment. It does mean that there are a large number of technical specifications but also that those specifications do change over time as the needs of the ADF change. <span style="font-style:italic;">(Time expired)</span></span>

As I said in my earlier answer, approximately 99 per cent of suppliers of defence combat and non-combat clothing for the financial year 2010-11 were Australian. One of the most important clothing products provided to our soldiers is the combat uniform. The senator would be interested to know that in November last year the Minister for Defence Materiel made it clear that the standard combat uniformâthe shirt and the pantsâwill continue to be manufactured in Australia. This means that the fabric is woven in Australia and the garment is stitched together in Australia. The specifications are designed, obviously, to meet the needs of the Defence Force, and 99 per cent of suppliers are Australian companies.</span>

Value for money does not necessarily suggest that defence will accept the cheapest offer. Rather, the evaluation considers such issues as the overall performance against the specification as well as any risks associated with the procurement, in addition to the overall cost. There are a range of measures that are taken into account. I acknowledge the concern that the senator raised about the impact that just assessing the lowest price might have, but that is not the system used by the ADF. They do balance a range of issues that include price, overall performance against specification and any risks associated with the procurement, in addition to the cost issue.</span>

The minister was asked very specifically whether the cost of the carbon tax implementation will put the budget surplus in 2012-13 at risk. The minister has not gone anywhere near the question. We did not ask about any other risks; we asked about the very simple and single risk of the carbon tax to the budget surplus. I would ask you to draw the minister to the question.</span>

Certainly, Mr Hockey on the surpluses has said to the Australian people, as the most senior economic spokesperson for the coalition, that he wants to run down the surpluses. He wants smaller surpluses in order to fund tax cuts. That is what your senior economic spokesperson has said, Senator Cormann.

Even on the most generous interpretation of the requirements to be directly relevant there is no possibility of saying that the minister has been in any way directly relevant to the question that was asked, which was to what extent the cost of implementation of the carbon tax will put the budget surplus at risk.

We will ensure that they are delivered by making the savings and delivering the savings. To come into this place, when the shadow Treasurer has made clear that your policy is to run down the surpluses, and pretend that that is not relevant to a surplus discussion just shows that rational economic policy has deserted your side. <span style="font-style:italic;">(Time expired)</span></span>

I have also said in this place and elsewhere that the figures in relation to the budget will be updated in the usual way, just as they were under your government, Senator Cormannâthrough you, Mr Presidentâjust as they were after the GST was announced, when, subsequently, budget figures were updated in the usual way. So you would anticipate that the next budget update will reflect any changes in relation to the budget numbers between the budget itself and the subsequent budget update.</span>

Given that, as of Sunday, the revenue figures in the budget will be wrong, the expenditure figures in the budget will be wrong, the CPI figures in the budget will be wrong, the economic growth figures in the budget will be wrong and the employment figures in the budget will be wrong, why would the government not bring down another budget before pressing ahead with its carbon tax?</span>

To suggest that the figures are wrong is simply incorrect. As I have said, we will update the figures. Obviously the figures for jobs would have to be updated because we have seen a continued improvement in full-time jobs in the figures outlined today, which brings to 750,000 the number of jobs created in Australia since November 2007, since this government came into power. We on this side have worked to ensure that we have protected employment and economic growth through the global financial crisis. If we followed the advice of those opposite, including Senator Cormann, 200,000 Australians would have been added to the unemployment queues. We have created 750,000 jobs on this sideâthat includes the growth in full-time jobs in the last figures announced todayâwhen those on the other side would have added 200,000 unemployed.</span>

It was drawn to the attention of the Acting Deputy President at the time. Senator Brown walked in and out of the chamber, deliberately not acknowledging the President. I was wondering if you might refer this intolerable behaviour to the President and get the President to give a ruling, perhaps even to the extent of excluding the senator from the chamber until such time as he learns some manners.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">Whatever the issue, whatever the challenge, whatever needs to be done, the only answer that the Labor Party has got is to whack on another tax: 'When people drink too much, let's whack on an alcopops tax. When there is a two-speed economy with the mining industry in the fast lane, let's whack on a mining tax. When there are too many global greenhouse emissions, let's whack on a tax on carbon dioxide emissions in Australia. ' Well, I have got some information for the Labor Party. Whacking on another taxâtax, tax, taxâis not the only way that you can actually resolve policy challenges that we face as a nation.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We know that this Labor government has a terrible record when it comes to the management of our public finances. It is a Labor government that has delivered deficit after deficitânine consecutive deficits. It is a Labor government that is not able to live within its means. It is a Labor government that is addicted to spending. Of course, to feed that spending addiction, they have to come up with one new tax after anotherâand the carbon tax is no different.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">You would think that whacking on another tax would get the government to a position where they would actually be able to balance the books, but no. Only the Labor Party can come up with another tax that raises $11 billion every year and still have a budget that is $4 billion worse off. Only the Labor Party can come up with a mining tax which is supposed to raise $38.5 billion over 10 years but leave the budget $20 billion worse off over the same periodâbecause the related budget commitments are conservatively estimated to be at least $57.6 billion. No wonder the country's finances are in such disarray under Labor Party administrations. The Labor Party are always trying to catch up to fund their reckless spending left, right and centre. Whenever they come up with another tax that they think might get them into striking distance of bringing the budget back into surplus they spend so much money on other thingsâbecause they have to do so many little deals to get their bad changes through the parliamentâthat the budget actually ends up in a worse position than where it started.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The proposed carbon tax is, of course, bad policy for Australia. The reason it is bad policy for Australia is that it will make Australian business less competitive, it will push up the cost of everything and everyday Australians will face significant additional challenges in terms of cost-of-living pressuresâand all of that without actually helping to reduce greenhouse gas emissions. All we will do by putting a price on carbon in Australia through a carbon tax when none of our trade competitors are proposing to put a carbon tax in place is make overseas polluters more competitive than even the most environmentally efficient businesses here in Australia.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We have a Labor Party that is going left, right, left, right depending on where the public pressure comes from at any point in time. They change their position all time. Petrol is in then petrol is out. The carbon tax is going to apply to 1,000 companies and then it is going to apply to 500 companies. One day they are going to ban cattle exports and then they are not going to ban them. One day they think offshore processing of asylum seekers is a terrible thing and then they are trying to do a deal with Malaysia on offshore processing. One day they say they would never do a deal with a country that is not part of the United Nations convention on refugees and then they do one. This government is all over the place depending on where the pressure is coming from at a particular time.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We found out here in question time again today that the pressure right now is coming from the Greens. This is a government that deceived the Australian people in the lead-up to the last election, and it was not just the Prime Minister; every single Labor member elected to the House of Representatives or the Senate at the last election was elected on a promise that there would be no carbon tax under a government led by Julia Gillard. Of course, now there will be. Why? Because the Greens want it. Now, here we have the Prime Minister doing a cosy deal exclusively and in secret with Senator Bob Brown and a number of other people in this secret little committee. And the Labor caucus has been left in the dark. Senator Bushby quite appropriately referred to them as being treated like mushrooms. Senator Cameron had a very eloquent description of the way Labor senators were treatedâI think he may have used the words 'lobotomised zombies', or something like that. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I would not normally quote Senator Cameron but the point is that the Australian people are about to be lambasted with a carbon tax, which will be bad for themâ <span style="font-style:italic;">(Time expired)</span></span>

                  <a href="e5x" type="MemberSpeech">
                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Senator POLLEY</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-State">Tasmania</span>â<span class="HPS-MinisterialTitles">Deputy Government Whip in the Senate</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">15:07</span>):  Deputy President Parry, I formally congratulate you on your election to the office of Deputy President of the Senate. As a fellow Tasmanian, I commend you. I know you will do an excellent job. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Some of the comments that have been made in this debate in the chamber are a little unfortunate. Senator Bushby accused Labor senators of being like mushroomsâof being kept in the dark. Unlike him, I have never thrown my frock over my head when I have missed out on a position; I understand Senator Bushby is still sulking.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I would also like to take the opportunity to congratulate Senator Kroger on her elevation to the position of Chief Opposition Whip. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I would like to put on the record that a lot has been made of the announcement on Sunday but I do not think there is a better day. I will be celebrating my husband's birthÂ­day. It will certainly be a very memorable day for him, unlike those opposite, who are only interested in running scare campaigns. They have little to contribute to a real debate on any policy in this country. There has been talk about people doing backflips and changingâgoing from left to rightâbut there are some opposite who know that climate change is real and who were supportive of carbon pricing previously. They have done backflips. So I think we need to put on record the real issues relating to the price of carbon.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Senator Cormann has said that we are trying to go it alone. Australia is not going it alone. In fact, the longer we delay, the greater the risk to our economy. A broad and growing number of countries are pricing carbon. For example, 32 countries and a number of US states already have emissions trading schemes. Carbon taxation is in place in the UK, Denmark, Finland, Norway, Sweden, the Netherlands, Canada, and in selected places in China and India. So we should be honest when we come into the chamber and make comments on issues of great significance like this policy. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">In terms of the assistance that households are going to get, those opposite, as usual, are very negative. They want to run away from any real debate but the fact is that nine out of 10 households will get a combination of tax cuts and an increase in the pension or family payments and other payments to help them adjust to the cost of living. The vast majority of those households will not lose a cent because of the carbon price. That is a fact. That will allow those households to do their bit on climate change without making financial sacrifices.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I think the majority of Australians out there understand that climate change is real. They have elected this government to govern in the best interests of this country. And we will be doing that. Australians know that lower income families do not have a lot of room to move. That is why we have taken the steps that we haveâto ensure that there is a safety net for those whose costs are higher than average, to give them a bit of extra room to move. Our package is carefully put together to make sure that over three million households will get a bufferâup to an extra 20 per cent in tax cuts and payments over and above meeting the impact of the carbon price. It is a bit like Christmas. You will have to wait until Sunday. You will have to wait for the details but it will be worth tuning in to, I can assure you.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">On the other hand, Mr Abbott has for some considerable time now been going around the country trying to scare families and the community. He is not prepared to enter into any real debate on this policy. He has been trying to scare the public into believing that families are going to be worse off with carbon pricing. He says they will have to pay up to $720 a year more in taxes and charges while the polluters get off scot-free. That is not going to be acceptable to the Australian people </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We will get the details on Sunday and then we will see what happens as the weeks and months go on. When the facts are out there and the package is announced, I feel confident that the Australian community will get behind this policy and will see the benefits to the environment. They will also see that the measures we introduce will be within our budget restraints so that we will bring the budget back into surplus. Those are the commitments that we have made. Those are the commitments that the Prime Minister will be keeping.</span>

I congratulate you on your election to that position, although I can tell you that you are being sadly missed in the whips meetings.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">It is quite amazingâa new tax is going to solve everything! Senator Polley is saying that there are emissions trading schemes and carbon taxes in other countries. There is an emissions trading scheme in Europe. It covers 30 countries. Those 30 countries produce 14 per cent of the world's greenÂ­house gases. Australia produces just one-tenth of thatâ1.4 per cent. The money it costs those 30 countries is the equivalent of A$500 million a year. What is this governÂ­ment's going to cost? Will it be $8 billion or $10 billion, rising from then on? When we get to the emissions trading scheme, who knows what the cost will be? It will be the market that determines the price of carbon. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">It is amazing. They talk about compensaÂ­ting households. That might happen when the price is $23 per tonne but what will happen if, in five years time, under the emissions trading scheme, the price of carbon goes to $80 per tonne? The National Australia Bank has even forecast $100 a tonne. How would you compensate if the price was four times higher? Here is the problem already obvious to all. The most amazing thing is that China, India and America are the countries that produce 50 per cent of the world's greenhouse gases. Is there a price on carbon in China? Of course there is not. They are going to increase their expulsion of greenhouse gases by three billion tonnes by the year 2020. In India there is no price on carbon even though the Productivity Commission says it is the cheapest way to carry this out. Why don't they have it? There will be an extra two billion tonnes by them. Between India and China there will be five billion tonnes extra come the year 2020. America: a few states doing very little. Those opposite talk about New Zealand's emissions trading scheme. New Zealand produces 0.1 per cent of the world's greenhouse gas by burning fossil fuels, which is basically zero. No matter what we do, nothing will change.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We have already seen fear put into industries. There was news today about the closing of the Kandos cement factory. They can see the writing on the wall. They are facing a high Australian dollar and cheap imports of cement from China, which coincidentally produces in excess of one billion tonnes of cement a year. They produce 1.1 tonnes of greenhouse gas compared to our 0.8 tonnes. What I am saying is that for those 10 million tonnes of cement made in Australia, if we shut our factories down and import the cement from China, there will be an extra three billion tonnes of CO<span style="text-decoration:none underline;">2</span>. This is a problem. We will be shifting our industries overseas, whether they be aluminium, steel or cement. We have heard about the job losses as a result of Kandos closing down. Kandos cement is a very popular, common product in Australia, and that has been a very disappointing announcement.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">But there will be more to come. You cannot tax Australian industries. My fear is for the abattoir at Inverell. Bindaree Beef will probably face an extra $600,000 or $700,000 a year in electricity bills. But will our competitors in America competing for the Korean, South Korean and Japanese beef markets have to pay it? Of course they will not. We talk about fuel. Yes, it is a popular thing not to put the tax on petrol for the tradies or the small vehicles. What is going to happen to the truckies? Already Senator Sterle has made a point about the truckies doing it tough at the Top End of Australia with that outrageous decision to have a total suspension on the export of live cattle. And now the truckies are going to get more of their excise kept by the government.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">It was the coalition in government that gave the 18.5c a litre rebate to the transport industry. That has been reduced to 15c because those over there in the Australian Labor Party only know one thingâtax, tax, tax. I can take you through them: the alcopops tax, the cigarette tax, the luxury car tax, the flood tax, the mining tax, the carbon tax. All they know is tax, and now they are going to get into the truckies with the diesel, and probably the miners as well. It is not about cutting their spending, taking the pressure off interest rate risesâseven interest rate rises in a row. No, they will simply spend, spend, borrow, borrow, mortgage our children's future away.</span>

Why wasn't it in this year's budget? Come Sunday we will see and hear a lot about it. And what effect will it have on CO2 emissions around the world? It will have absolutely zero effect but it will drive industries overseas and it will cost jobs. The Australian Labor Party used to stick up for the worker once; the worker is the last person they ever think of these days.</span>

                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Senator MOORE</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-State">Queensland</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">15:17</span>):  Mr Deputy President, I was struggling to think of a way to introduce my comments about last night's State of Origin result into this debate and make it relevant. I am pleased to sayâonly the few people who are sitting here in the chamber would have been able to seeâthat some of the moves that Senator Cormann put on in his take-note speech gave me the perfect opportunity to say, 'You would be a proud contributor to any Queensland team, Senator Cormann, with your movements earlier.' That gives me a chance to put on record my congratulations to the Queenslanders.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Senator Cormann's comments in that contribution seemed to indicate that there has only ever been one party in the history of Australian government that has looked at putting taxation into the community. We have also heard from Senator Williams that there is only one party in the history of the Australian economy that has ever, through its process of developing economic responses, looked at taxation! Strangely enough, a very quick scrutiny of <span style="font-style:italic;">Hansard</span> over the history of the Commonwealth, which I was able to do in the last minute or so, has proven that governments of all persuasions from the very startâ1901âhave debated in the chambers of parliament taxation for the Australian community. The way that is done has not changed that much. Proposals for economic processes come through the community, there is discussion, concern, interest and then in this place there are specific arguments about the merits of individual proposals. That is what is going to happen when we look at the pricing process of the carbon issue in this country.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">When the details are released publicly on Sundayâdespite the many times over the past week when there have been attempts to say what is going to happen, the details will not be released until Sundayâthe issue will be in the public domain for discourse. There will be an expectation that people will be able to see the detail, will be able to argue about the impact on their own circumstances. And when parliament returns, as we see all the time, there will be the opportunity for informed discussion on the issue. Rather than just throwing up our hands with extraordinarily quick movements in every directionâmuch like that of Queensland rugby league team!âthere will be the opportunity for debate here so we will be able to look at the real issue.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We have seen over the past months the development of concern, information and knowledge about why there should be a price on carbon. We have had this discussion. There will be people who will never agree, and we hear that regularly in this place. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The government has a position. There has been a multi-party group considering this over several months but unfortunately, as I said before, that multi-party group was lacking a couple of parties. Nonetheless, the multi-party group looked at the ways of doing this and the reasons, the background to our responsibilities on the issue of carbon.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">No matter how many times you throw up the argument that because some people are not doing anything in this area then we should not, it is not a reasonable response to an international need and an international demand. As a community, as a country, we must look at the issues of pollution and carbon pricing and the destruction of our environment. Once that threshold point is there, then you look at how you do it. The process this government is putting forward to the community, to the debate in this parliaÂ­ment, is that there should be a price on carbon. How it will work, what will be the individual processes and what will be the compensation to individuals and business will be the subjects of debate. But to just pretend that there has never been a taxation process discussed in parliament before, to pretend that we have any right as an AustraÂ­lian community or parliament to run away from our responsibilities, to pluck figures from the air and say that we will not be able to effectively and reasonably take this debate here, is not a respectful way of looking at the way parliament operates. There will be a debate on carbon price. There must be a debate on carbon price. When we get into the aspects of how it will work, there shall be a sensible discussion on carbon price. To run a scare campaign, to pretend that the only response to the economy has been taxation from one side of government, lowers the argument. It shows that there is not an intent to look at the real issues. Once again, for people not to want to look at the real issues around the need for our whole globe, our whole area, to take their responsiÂ­bilities in this incredibly important area of protecting the environment is not safe. <span style="font-style:italic;">(Time expired)</span></span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">
                  <a href="YW4" type="MemberSpeech">
                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Senator IAN MACDONALD</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-State">Queensland</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">15:23</span>):  The two Australian Labor Party speakers have told us, 'Wait until Sunday and you will hear what Ms Gillard is going to promise by way of compensation to all of those Australian families that will be attacked by Labor's newest tax, this time the carbon tax.' I say to Senator Moore or Senator Brown: who could possibly believe Julia Gillard, our Prime Minister, on her form? A couple of days before the last election, Julia Gillard got up, hand on heart, and promised faithfully to the Australian public, 'There will be no carbon tax under a government I lead.' Six short months later she is doing the exact opposite. I say to my colleagues in the Australian Labor Party opposite: whatever Ms Gillard says on Sunday absolutely no-one will believe, because this person has form when it comes to telling the truth.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Senator Moore also raised in her contribution to this debate to take note of answers at question time the issue of taxes having been introduced by every government since Federation. I agree with her. It was a government that I was a minister in which introduced the goods and services tax. The difference with the GST is that John Howard laid out on the table every element of the GST, told the Australian public what was going to happen with the GST and then went to an election. If the Australian public did not want a GST, they could have voted the Howard government out. They did not. They returned the Howard government and the GST, thankfully, has been the greatest financial reform that this country has ever seen, and it was genuine reform done by the Howard government and done honestly. Contrast that with the Gillard government: 'There shall be no carbon tax under a government I lead'âhand on heart, a solemn promise, four days before the election and one day before the last election.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">People in New South Wales, people around Australia, voted for Ms Gillard and her party because they believed her with her promise that there shall be no carbon tax. You can understand now why opinion poll after opinion poll is showing how absolutely annoyed, how angry, the Australian voters are that they were deceived then. They are also angry that Ms Gillard promised she would be more likely to play full-forward for the Bulldogs than to take over Kevin Rudd's job. A couple of days later, what did she do? She got out the sabre, knifed him right in the back and became Prime Minister. This person has form. The Australian public, I suggest, have stopped listening to Ms Gillard. They do not believe and will not believe anything she says, and I say to the Australian public that you are very wise to take absolutely no notice of anything Ms Gillard might tell you on Sunday about so-called compensation. There is no need for compensation. All you do is not have the tax and then you do not have to worry about compensation.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">As one of my colleagues pointed out, Australia emits less than 1.4 per cent of the world's total greenhouse gas emissions. I would like Senator Wong to participate in this debate and tell me if, as a result of this carbon tax, Australia's emissions are reduced by five per cent by 2020 what that is going to do to the total reduction in greenhouse emissions around the world. Absolutely nothing. What it will do is send jobs offshore, namely, to China, where they do not have a carbon tax or an emissions trading scheme, where they have less stringent rules than we have in Australia, and they would be more than doubling in a few weeks the reduction in the amount of emissions from Australia. If anyone can tell me how that is a good idea, I would be delighted to learn. I do know that, as a result of this carbon tax, Australia's standard of living will fall, our cost of living will increase and people up in North Queensland, Central Queensland, the coalmines and the manufacturing areas will lose their jobs because of this carbon taxâfrom a Prime Minister we simply cannot trust.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">Operationalising international standards is a job that people do every day. It is a very simple process. You have critical control points, you have a set of standards, and someone identifies critical control points in those standards. This only relates to animal welfare and traceability.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">But the critical control points in addition to those already in placeâand well known by this governmentâwere at the point at which the feedlot already had the standard. The pretty blonde cow with No. 63 in her ear goes through onto the ship, into the feedlot. She has already been traced there so she then gets onto the truck that goes to processing. There is a panel there that does it and that is a standard, so that is a critical control point that they have to go to. They then go the processing facility, the tag comes off and we know that there has been no loss of that animal in that process. The animal is then processed and at the point of processing the ear tag is then deemed to have closed the system. This is not rocket science; it is something that people do every single day.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">Why, in heaven's name, would you have an ISO third-party audited accreditation system and then somehow put in your own regulatory processesâwhich we have not seen or heard ofâunless the minister is just trying to use two lines to look as if they have had some sort of energy in this process? Why would you put in place strict regulatory controls that add third-party auditing when you actually have an international standard being met?</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">This is all a rationalisation about why they opened the trade: we have opened the trade because we have advice from Indonesia that they are prepared to issue import permits for the importation of cattle. I think it would strike almost anybody that one is unlikely to be able to issue an import permit from a country that had a prohibition on export. It would have been a bit difficult for the person who was processing this import. They would be asked: 'Where are you actually getting the cattle from? Australia? That does seem a bit odd, because they have been telling us that they have an export ban.' Saying that somehow this information that Indonesia was prepared to issue import permits was a reason or rationale for why the government changed its mind absolutely beggars belief.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">This statement is difficult to follow and understand.

                <span class="HPS-Normal">That was last Thursday. That would have been big news for industry. Those disconnected families, those people without jobs and those with twice as many cattle as can be taken on the rangelands would have said: 'Well, now it's okay. We have had this wonderful piece of information. We all feel a lot better.'</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">It is an environmental nightmare, a human tragedy across the Top End of proportions we have certainly not seen in my time in this country. It is a complete meltdown, and that is the advice that they gave them. The Prime Minister is talking about animal welfare issues. Perhaps she was not aware that, as a consequence of the ban, having twice as many cows with the same amount of grass would cause an animal welfare issue. And we have actually quoted this complete debacle in the state. It beggars belief why someone would rush and put out this sort of rubbish.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">It was the industry that did the work. I was over in Indonesia last weekend. I was talking to industry; I was looking at how they did it. I did not see any government officials over there doing the work. 'We put the framework in place.' What Labor has done has created a complete human disaster across the Top End. Now they are saying, 'Oops, sorry about that,' and are going to somehow take the credit for fixing it. This is emblematic of this government. The only time they appear to try to tell you they have done something well is to say: 'Look, we've fixed it. Pink batts? Sorry about that; no, we've got another program. You're supposed to clap.' In respect of the disaster with the school halls debacle, Building the Education Revolution, they say: 'Oh, by the way, the media says we have invested in all this stuff. We'll fix it.' They are absolute rocket scientists at fixing disasters of their own making, and this is another one.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Right from day one, we were pretty pleasant about it; we said, 'Look, the thing you need to do is to reverse this decision. You made a reasonable decision on day one.' The decision made on day one was to say: 'Look, there are obviously places these cattle do not need to go to. You can only send them to places where we are assured that the animals will be treated to a standard.' Those standards were there then. Those inline processes were there then. All they had to do was lift the ban, and that is the only thing they did not do for a full month. Of course, they have waved the magic wand; it is all fine now! There are just a couple of things missing. An important one, of course, is those cattle. Now, where do we put them? They are probably in the back paddock.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I have driven down some of these fencelines and they are 100 kilometres long in one paddock. These are enormous places. This is an extensive enterprise. This is not intensive farming. You do not whistle up the sheepdog and go round the back paddock and squirrel them onto the truck. This is an enormous undertaking, and they are doing it for the second time. They have already invested hundreds of thousands of dollars in getting these cattle to the point where they are, and suddenly they are told: 'Sorry about that, guys. Just go back to square one.' Do they think they are going to keep the cattle in a pen? You cannot do that. There is not any fodder. They have done the right thing in looking after the animals, and they have released them back onto the rangeland. We have to get the cattle back. I have had numbers of very sad and tragic calls from people trying to find work in pretty tough conditions. The trucks are still sitting there; it is pretty hard to start the truck without the driver, as Mr Sterle will attest. Some of them have gone to the mines. Some of them are looking for other work. I can tell you that, when someone moves from driving a truck with cattle and makes the decision to go to the mines, sometimes it is pretty hard to get them back.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">And that is the other thing, of course: we have that bit of water between us. So we are going to need the odd ship. I tell you what: it is going to take more than a sheepdog to find those. They have gone to other parts of the world to ply their trade in different places with different cattle to our market. These ships are not going to arrive like that. So they are on the phone now saying, 'Sorry about that.' The Australian government are not making those calls. It is the exporters saying: 'I wonder where those ships went. If you can possibly come back. I know it's a bit embarrassing; this government does that a bit.'</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The other thing is how the markets are going. Every day last year we exported 15,000 head of cattle. This is a fresh-meat market, and there is a process. What is going to happen now is that every ship that did not sailâevery day that went pastâwas another 15,000 head that will not leave our rangeÂ­lands and will not arrive in the marketplace.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">And of course there is the relationship with Indonesia. I am completely embarrassed when a Third World, developing country refers to Australia as a sovereign risk, very irresponsible. That is what they have said. <span style="font-style:italic;">(Time expired)</span></span>

                  </a>  Mr Deputy President, I congratulate you on your promotion. I stand to make a comment and all of a sudden I hear the mouth from the west going off. It did not take him long!</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I made a contribution yesterday and I want to reiterate what I was talking about. I am one of those senators who are so glad to see the ban lifted. I said yesterday, in support of Senator Scullion and in support of my colleagues from Western Australia Senator Back and Senator Adams, that this $330 million industry is so darn vital to the north of our country that I would hate to think where we would be without it. I also said yesterday and reiterate that some 500,000 head of cattle went out last year but it is the thousands and thousands of jobs in the Top End of Australia, particularly in my state of Western Australia, in the Northern Territory and in Queenslandâit is to a lesser extent in some of the other statesâwithout which the north of Australia could not survive on tourism alone. There are bits of mining here and there; that is quite right.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I want to talk about the Kimberley. That is a part of the world whereâunlike you, Senator Cormann, or you, Mr Deputy President, though I stand to be corrected if I am wrongâI made my living from 1979 through to 1991. I still have a very long affiliation with the Kimberley, in particular through my connections and my work with the Kimberley Aboriginal Pastoralists Association. As I said yesterday, Mr Doodie Lawford from Bohemia Downs, who represents 22 Aboriginal pastoral leases, said that without the opportunity of the live export trade he did not know where they would be. They proudly employ Aboriginal boys as stockmen through Doodie Lawford and KAPA, who for years have invested in training Aboriginal boys to get them out of some of the sad situations they find themselves in in some of our Kimberley towns like Fitzroy, Broome, Derby, Wyndham and Kununurra, to give them the opportunity to follow in the footsteps of their grandfathers. There is such pride in watching them do that. So when the ban was put on, after those shocking images that we saw on <span style="font-style:italic;">Four Corners </span>that evening, it worried me to think where these boys would end up if we did not have a live export trade.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I go back to one of the greatest prime ministers we had in this country: the Right Hon. RJ Hawke. When Prime Minister Hawke took the initiative and had the deterÂ­minaÂ­tion to give our Aboriginal traditional owners the opportunity not only to work their country but own their country; self-determine and make a decent, honest living; live in country and do the things they want to do; and pass on their language, law and culture to their young ones; what a wonderful opportunity there was through pastoralism. So I take offence when I find those on the opposite side bagging us because we have endeavoured to do whatever we could to get this industry back on its feet.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Let us make no mistake: the ban had to be put on. But, as the Prime Minister has said repeatedly and as the honourable Minister for Agriculture, Fisheries and Forestry, Senator Ludwig, has said, not one day longer would we take than needed to get this industry up and running again. And here we have Senator Scullion, who I still believe is a very honourable representative of the Northern Territory pastoral industry, standÂ­ing here condemning and bagging us. Does he want us to put a ban back on and stop the industry again? We know that the industry will not kick off and be exporting cattle tonight; but, for crying out loud, we actually now have a system where we will have full traceability. We will have auditing on the ground, which I know Senator Back and I have discussed. Senator Back and I work very closely. We are not on the same side of the political fence, but we both have decency in our DNA. There you go, Senator Back; you owe me one! But what we have discussed is having this sort of thing on the ground where we have accountability and traceability so we know where our cattle are going. I think it is a darn good start that that ban has been lifted, and I want to do everything I can in supporting the minister, the Prime Minister, the Minister for Foreign Affairs and the Minister for Trade, who worked day and night to get this industry back up and running. So I can go back up to the Kimberley next week, where I will be, and I will be on one of those Aboriginal pastoral leases, at Doon Doon. I will be talking to the traditional owners at Doon Doon, and I will be getting their concerns. I have to tell you: I am in Doon Doon every year at least once and, if there were not a live export trade, those poor devils would have absolutely nothing. They would have no chance of jobs, no chance of a decent living and no chance of self-respect.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">So I do take offence when I hear the opposition condemning us for actually acting, and I also take offence when I find out that Animals Australia and the RSPCA, as I said yesterday, had held those images for at least one month before the images were aired on the <span style="font-style:italic;">Four Corners</span> program; they gave them to Senator Coonan. Through you, Mr Deputy President, I do not condemn Senator Coonan. Senator Coonan is a very decent person, and she would have been alarmed at those images. But when I find out that those animal representative bodies, who I have supportedâthe RSPCA in particular, who were always welcome in my office until nowâheld those images so they could build up, in their words as reported by Colin Bettles, political ammunition and political angst, they should stand condemned too. The truth of the matter is that those people are not honourable. Those people do not care about our northern pastoral industry. They do not care about our Aboriginal pastoralists. They do not care about those Aboriginal boys with dreams in their eyes of following their grandfathers' footsteps to become stockmen. If those groups had their way, those Aboriginal people would live under a tree peacefully and we would not have to put up with them. So they stand condemned in my view.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We will get this industry up and running. It is up and running. We have a system now that we did not have before. Quite rightly, I do not believe one Australian could sit back and condone the practices that were seen on that footage shot in Indonesia in those abattoirs. It made me feel sick. But I want to also stress this, Mr Acting Deputy Presidentâsorry, Mr Deputy President. I am so glad of your promotion; I really am. It is coming through my head, because you and I came into the Senate at the same time and, again, I am so proud of that. Unfortunately, there is no other alternative for our northern pastoral industry. There are all these myths around that we could go back to the good old days and open the abattoirs again in Port Hedland, in Broome, in Derby, in Wyndham and in Kununurra. I say this clearly: I would much rather see a boxed meat market. I would much rather see Australian abattoirs employing AustraliansâAustralian jobs. I could not think of anything better. There is no market for that. There is no demand for a frozen meat market to Indonesia. We are talking about some 2,000-odd islands out there. We are talking about abattoirsâwet abattoirsâthat do not even have access to electricity, so they do not have freezers. They do not have Coles and Woolworths on every corner where they can walk in and buy their cuts. Unfortunately for us, that is our market. But it is our responsibility to put in a decent system of accountability, traceability and auditing, and that is what the minister has done.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I want to congratulate the minister. It has been a horrific time for him. It has been a horrific time for our producers, our truckies, our stockmen and our rural businesses that rely on the northern live export tradeâour truck owners, our tyre fitters, our electricians, the mechanics and everyone who services those industries in the Top End of Australia. Without that industryâwell, I do not even want to go there. So the minister must stand congratulated. It is in the best interests of Australians. The opposition should be standing alongside us. The oppoÂ­sition should be working with us and should congratulate us. We should congratulate the industry for taking that step forward, and we should congratulate people like Mr Paul Holmes a CourtâI think it is Paul, but I am sorry if it is not; it might be Peterâwho has said clearly to his clients that not one of his cattle will go to an abattoir unless it is stunned. He has made that decision, and I urge all Australian cattle producers to follow his lead.</span>

                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Senator BACK</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-State">Western Australia</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">15:49</span>):  I rise to take note of the ministerial statement of Senator Ludwig, the Minister for Agriculture, Fisheries and Forestry. He is to be acknowledged for the fact that this suspension has been lifted as of last evening. Some of the comments made by previous speakersâSenator Scullion and Senator Sterleâare certainly acknowledged. The tragedy is that there never was a need to completely suspend the trade. On 3 June this year I circulated very widely a media release; I will quote from parts of it. I called for immediate action to improve animal welfare practices in Indonesian abattoirs and to restore confidence to the Australian publicâproducers and, of course, the wider community. But I went on to say that we should not do anything at all to ban the export of live animals to Indonesia, because it would pose significant risks to biosecurity, marketing and diplomatic relations. Regrettably, my predictions were true.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">In his statement, the minister has made the observation:</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Small">Following the provision of the footageâ</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">that is the ABC footageâ</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Small">the Government moved to suspend supply of Australian livestock to the featured abattoirs â¦</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The coalition strongly supported the minister at that time to that extent and, had he stopped at that point, he would have continued to enjoy that support. But, despite the advice given to him by people who know the industry, who understand well the animal welfare and other implications and who understand well the outrage of the communityâquite rightlyâat the footage we saw, regrettably he took that step of completely suspending the trade, placing Australian producers, Australian supporters of the industry and the welfare of animals in the north of Australia at risk and, of course, not only severely damaging the diplomatic relations we have with Indonesia as a favoured neighbour but also placing at risk the supply of much-needed protein for the community there.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">There is a lesson here for everybody in this parliament, and the lesson is one of not jumping to a quick conclusion based on teleÂ­vision footage and social media reactions. I will not speak in this place at this time about the fairness, the bias or the validity of that ABC footage; that is for another time in this place. What I will, however, comment on is the severity of the reaction which forced this government to act. Let me comment by way of contrast that the same program, <span style="font-style:italic;">Four Corners</span>, only this Monday evening ran an horrific series of footage on the atrocities visited upon women in Sri Lanka by both sides of their political movement in recent times, the sort of footage vastly worse, surely, addressed upon human beings. I will not relay what has been put to me of that footage, but what has been the outcry around the Australian community in the last 72 hours to that footage? Practically nil; yet the terrible footage we saw of the absolutely unquestioned cruelty visited upon those animals in Indonesia led to an email campaign where I received hundreds of thousands of emails.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Regrettably, I was able to confirm only this morning that an email apparently sent to me by one of my relations in fact was falseâit was a fraud. I rang him and said, 'Rex, it is unusual: if you had that degree of interest and concern, knowing that we are related and that I have been in this game of 40 years, I would have thought you might have called me.' He said, 'Chris, I am outraged at the reaction that occurred in the first place that actually caused the suspension of the whole trade.' He also comes from an agricultural background. How many more of those emails were fraudulent? It was an absolute disgrace.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I certainly do acknowledge the minister has now moved to this position whereby the trade will reopen. The point I want to make is that, with proper consultation with the industry and with Indonesian interests, we need never have suspended the trade to those abattoirs that do already meet and, indeed, exceed OIE international animal health requirementsâand I speak of some managed by Indonesians, some managed by Australians.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The traceability to which the minister has referred in his document is quite correct. Australia, unknown to others, leads the world already in national livestock identification. We are the only country to have it. You might say, 'Well, why aren't the pastoral cattle already identified in the scheme?' The reason is that, quite simply, it was a scheme designed so that, if somebody had an adverse reaction to meat they had purchased from a retailer yesterday or the day before, that meat could be followed right back to the farm of origin. That was the purpose for which we brought the NLIS into place. But when it was brought in the northern pastoral industry went to governÂ­ment and said: 'Look, our calves are born on the station, they grow, they go from the station to the port, from the port to the feedlot in Indonesia and then to the abattoir. We believe that there is no need for an NLIS association with our cattle.' That was agreed upon. The point to be made now is that the Australian industry is so well versed we have already got in place the only international NLIS. To fill that gap and complete that loop always was an easy task. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">One of the comments I made in my release on 3 June was the need for an:</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Small">... independent assessment by competent people to review the welfare and management standards in Indonesian abattoirs, including those processing Australian cattle ...</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">That 'was essential' as was the reporting back to the Australian community. I am pleased that the minister has acknowledged the contribution of the Australian Veterinary Association, with whom the minister and his department have worked closely to achieve what was announced last night. I have long maintained that well-experienced veterinarÂ­ians are the very people to be able to satisfy interests here in Australia, the community, producers and others. He has announced that it will be audited by international independÂ­ent audit agencies. I am very happy with that process. I make the point simply that it was not necessary to close the trade down to achieve that outcome.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">What is the impact of closing down the trade? Animals are not like a mine site. If the price of gold or iron ore is not right, you can just leave the minerals in the ground. Animals are not like a production line of motor cars. If something adverse occurs, if there is an interruption in supply or a problem with labour or a problem with power, you can just turn off the switch, close the doors and everybody goes home. Even an airline, dare I say, with an animal related name like Tigerâregrettable and all as that is, and I hope for everybody's sake that safety issues can be addressed and that that airline can start flying againâdoes not require daily feeding. The planes are not out there growing, they are not out there reproÂ­ducing and they are not out there having calves like the cows in the range lands are at this very moment. That is a lesson that is surely learnt for the future. We cannot have a circumstance in a livestock related enterprise where we just close it down with no consultation with producers, with exporters, with those involved in the supply chain and particularly with our end market.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I have made the point before, and my colleague Senator Scullion has made it also, that we are now going to see overstocking on the rangelands. We are not going to get back to exporting 500,000 or 600,000 cattle a year. We are going to see overgrazing on the rangelands. This year's calves are going to be competing with last year's calves, which should be on ships and which should be going to Indonesia.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I make the point again that the properties we are speaking about are leasehold properÂ­ties in which the pastoralist has no equity. He cannot go to the bank and use his pastoral lease as collateral. It is questionable now what the value of his livestock is. Therefore, if these pastoralists have to walk off their properties, regrettably they will walk off them with absolutely nothing.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I conclude my comments with the IndoÂ­nesian relationshipâone, as I pointed out yesterday, that has been built up over many years and one in which the Indonesians have built up confidence in us. I hope that they will not see the events of the last five weeks as being irreparable. I hope they will see that we have invested heavily with them over time, that we have walked beside them over time and that we want to continue walking beside them over time to once again become a reliable supplier of product, of protein, of expertise and of shared technology. I hope we never have the circumstance again in which Australia is an unreliable supplier.</span>
              </p>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">In doing so, I just want to draw the Senate's attention to some of the issues that were raised during this international meeting. As senators would be aware, around this world twice a year the Inter-Parliamentary Union Assembly gathers to hold its discussions, exchange views and ideas and to debate current topics of all the countries that have operating parliaments. Many countries make the effort to get to IPU meetings and of course every year in October, the general assembly occurs.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The reason I wanted to speak this afternoon on this report is that this delegation last year was led by Senator Michael Forshaw, who is, of course, no longer in the Senate, and I wanted to put some comments down for the <span style="font-style:italic;">Hansard</span> about his role as the delegation leader. I particularly wanted to pay tribute to the Hon. Senator Judith Troeth, who was also on that delegation. In fact I think she had been going to IPU meetings for a number of years. I had been with her in 2009 and again in 2010. I wanted to make some comments about that because, if people from the Senate will remember, in 2009 when we were at the IPU meeting it was Judith Troeth and Roger Price, who at the time was a member of the House of RepÂ­resentatives, who so eloquently convinced the rest of the world and the world's parliaments that we should debate a motion on food security. Judith had the pleasure of travelling with us again last year. On the delegation were Mr Patrick Secker and me, and so four of us travelled last year to the IPU Assembly meeting.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Each year at an IPU Assembly meeting an emergency item is debated. Last year the debate occurred around the title of the motion, 'Immediate action to support interÂ­national relief efforts in response to natural disasters, and in particular with regard to flood-stricken Pakistan'. In hindsight, little did we know as the Australian parliament delegation when we provided some input into that motion being debated, that we would confront the tragedies that we saw in this country earlier this year in Queensland, New South Wales and Victoria. Little did we know that the Japanese delegation we met would soon experience the overwhelming tragedy that beset them when the tsunami occurred in their country. It is always very useful to have a discussion about how other countries tackle emergency situations such as those. Lessons have been learned and lessons could be learned and there is an exchange of ideas particularly from countries like Australia who have such a well-trained and well-equipped emergency management response, and teams in place. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">There were a number of other panel discussions, one of them providing a sound legislative framework aimed at preventing violence and improving election monitoring and ensuring a smooth transition to power. It reminded me, of course, that we can go from having one political party in power in this country to, overnight, having another political party in power, and our democracy is so well respected and well acknowledged that we do that seamlessly. When you go to an IPU meeting you have over 190 other countries confronting you and telling you that in their countries life is so not like that. In fact, life can be quite horrific and terrifyÂ­ing and devastating for many people when there is a change of political parties. So, again, Australia should hold its head up quite proudly because we know how expertly run our electoral system is and how much confidence the Australian public have in the way in which our elections are held and run, without bias and without political or military interference.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We also debated the role of parliaments in ensuring sustainable development through the management of natural resources, agricultural production and demographic change. And of course transparency and accountability in political party funding was the third general motion that was debated at that IPU meeting.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I want to spend some time highlighting the 15th Meeting of Women ParliamentÂ­arians which Judith and I attended and reported back to from a meeting that had been held in Bangkok. The emphasis there was on human trafficking and violence against women in places of detention and prison. Again, it is useful to hear what is happening around the globe in relation to the way women are treated, the placement of women in societies and the way in which women parliamentarians can use their position to improve what is happening. There are other subsidiary committees that meet at the same time and I was invited to attend the Advisory Group of the IPU committee that looks at United Nations affairs. This is a new group that has been formed to have a look at how the IPU itself can influence what is happening in the United Nations and how politicians from different countries can have input into what is happening at the UN. Australia has been invited by the president to nominate a delegate for this special advisory group. We have been invited to represent the Asia-Pacific group on the advisory group for an initial term of two years. I attended that initial meeting because I was in Geneva at the time representing Australia. I understand since then the Presiding Officers have nomÂ­inated Anthony Byrne as the subsequent and permanent representative of the Australian parliament for that initial two-year period. Again, I think this signals the esteem in which Australia and our politicians and our parliaments are held, to the point where we get specifically invited by the president to be one of 12 countries on this advisory group advising on the way in which parliaments and politicians can have input into what is happening in the United Nations. We should be very proud of our input as a parliament and across parties into ensuring that other parliaments and other parliamentarians learn from what we do so well in this country.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We also went across to France, prior to the IPU meeting. We had an indication that we wanted to meet with the International Energy Agency which the four of us did. That meeting was to look at issues to do with climate change, energy renewables and carbon capture and storage. We also accepted an invitation to go again to the French Senate, where we had a delightful time. I have to say that there is some rapport with the French senators and Judith, Michael and I felt some allegiance in terms of their warm and welcoming friendship when it comes to sharing our knowledge. At the time they were debating a bill to increase the age of retirement. They complained that they had just had three consecutive sitting nights that went well past midnight, and we said that there were times when we could relate to that workload.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Finally, as a group we went to the OECD, the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development, again pursuing our work here, particularly looking at regional development. They have just undertaken a regional development review which they gave us copies of and briefed us about. We also went to UNESCO, the United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organisation, and I am particularly pleased to say that we were briefed there on what they are doing with World Heritage programs, in particular the provision for maintaining Indigenous languages and culture. I met Dr Douglas Nakashima at UNESCO and I have since invited him to attend the Garma Festival at Yirrkala, which will be held in a couple of weeks. I have not heard if he is coming, but I know he has a particular interest in the maintenance and preservation of Indigenous languages and culture. I thought connecting him with the Garma Festival in Gove, which is to be held in five or six weeks, would be a perfect way to do that.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">All in all, I think the Australian parliaÂ­mentarians who represented this parliament and this country at the IPU assembly again did an outstanding and very professional job, one where we can boast that the work that we do in this parliament which is cross-party and bipartisan is held in high regard around the world.</span>

                    </a> (<span class="HPS-State">Western Australia</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">16:13</span>):  I am really proud to speak to this bill today. I am going to go into a bit of detail about how this has been a very long time coming, about some of this history of this bill and about the reasons why the Australian Greens believe that it is such an important piece of legislation. We on the cross benches do not put a huge number of private senator's bills before this parliament, but this is certainly the most important one that I have carriage of.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Today, we are debating the question of whether we as legislators and representatives of our electorates across this country are competent and able to make the decision about whether or not to deploy Australian troops to theatres of war. This is not about exercises; this is not about routine training. This is about who makes the final decision. Is it this parliament on behalf of the Australian public and on behalf of the families who will lose loved ones when we send Australians into harm's way? Who should make that decision? Should it be this parliamentâthis chamber and the other placeâor should it be the executive? I am very pleased that we are debating this bill today.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The Defence Amendment (Parliamentary Approval of Overseas Service) Bill 2010 [No. 2] has been known colloquially for several decades as the 'war powers bill'. It is about ensuring that a thorough debate is held in our parliament and that formal parliamentary endorsement is given before Australian governments take one of the most grave and serious responsibilities that a government can take: sending men and women to face danger, injury andâas we knowâall too often death and to inflict danger, injury and death on others in wars overseas. In recent years, wars have been waged by our country without the support and approval, the deliberation and the consensus of this parliament. That is a mistake that this bill seeks to address.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I expect that as the debate proceeds we will hear from both of the old parties. Maybe I will be accused of being well intentioned. Maybe I will be accused of being a little naive.</span>

                    </a>  Bingo; I think we have it. I am interested to point out that what the speakers will be declaring is that they hold that they are not competent or willing to make this decision. These senators have stood on one side of the chamber or another and listened to the stories as defence ministers have informed this parliamentâas they have had to over the last couple of yearsâthat another Australian life has been lost. Are we competent to make those decisions? Are we the ones who should be making those decisions? I believe as a representative of the Australian people that we should make these extraordinary decisions on behalf of the nation. If we are not willing to take on that responsibility, what on earth are we doing here and who do we believe is the right person?</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">It is appropriate to consider the costs associated in not ensuring that a proper debate is held before a deployment, in not ensuring that a war is necessary and legal. People need to understand the costs in lost lives and loss of international standing and credibility and the enormous financial costs of war.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We saw in 2003 what can happen when a handful of people make a decision to go to war in secret, behind closed doors and on a false premise. Australia was involved in an illegal war in Iraq that was justified using evidence later shown to be false. There was no proper debate before sending troops to war in Afghanistan, either. A debate was held more recently on the Afghanistan deployment at the behest of the Australian Greens. Senator Brown negotiated that into the agreement with the government last September because that debate had not been had in the 10 years of that deployment. We found later from the WikiLeaks drop exactly what our leaders think about what is going on in Afghanistan. We found out more from those revelations than from anything that the government or opposition told us in that parliamentary debate.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I agree with the foreign minister, who reportedly said that the Afghanistan deployment 'scared the hell out of him'. It is indeed a difficult, dangerous, bloody and grim situation. This war is not going well. We learned also from WikiLeaks that the Australian Federal Police Assistant Commissioner, Frank Prendergast, noted that the odds were stacked against success. Current training programs are hampered by illiteracy, corruption, drug addiction and insurgent penetration within the trainee body. All of these things were disclosed by the cables. He believes that a successful police training program will take 20 years to be effective in Afghanistan. None of that was told to this parliament when the debate was had at the behest of the Greens. Ministers and even shadow spokespeople have to put the best face on it: 'Everything is going well; we just need more time. Don't worry; everything's fine. We know best.' And we know that that is not true.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Afghanistan needs institution building, not incendiary weapons. Afghanistan needs professional police, not police trained by the military, which tendsâand history has shown this over and over againâto result in paramilitaries rather than community protectors. Afghan women, their suffering used as a symbol so cynically to justify war, are no safer today. Amnesty International says that women experience more insecurity and risk of sexual violence than during the Taliban era. A June 2011 survey by the Thomson Reuters Foundation showed that Afghanistan was the worst place in the world to be a womanâthe worst place in the world 10 years into an occupation. The mission there is flawed.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The majority of Australians want our troops brought home from Afghanistan because they are increasingly aware that the mission is flawed. According to a Lowy Institute annual poll of Australians on foreign affairs issues, support for the war in Afghanistan continues to erode, with 59 per cent of Australians now opposed to AustraÂ­lia's continued military involvement. And the Australian parliament, on behalf of those people, can do nothing about it under the current set-up.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">In the last couple of days we have had a shameful and haunting reminder of what it means to go into an illegal war. It means that crimes are committed in our name. I refer of course to the fact that Australia's defence forces have been revealed to have engaged in illegal activities, facilitating illegal detention practices in Iraq, including at the notorious Abu Ghraib prison and in Afghanistan I refer to the fact that an Australian officer was the primary author of the manual for processing prisoners in Iraq. He denied access by the Red Cross to detainees and said: 'The Red Cross call it ill treatment. We call it successful interrogation techniques.' That was a serving military lawyer. That is according to materials extracted under FOI by the Public Interest Advocacy Centre.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The 5 July editorial in the <span style="font-style:italic;">Sydney Morning Herald </span>remarked on the impliÂ­cations of the situation with incredibly strong language, something very rarely seen in Australian discourse. The editorial says, 'What is it that we are fighting for? If the purpose of sending troops to Afghanistan and Iraq was to uphold the right of citizens to equality before the law, the rule of law, our submission to the American way was a betrayal of that goal.' This editorial discusses our relationship with the United States without dismissing the importance of the allianceâand I again hope that senators will not waste the time of the chamber by accusing us of having no fidelity to that alliance. That editorial uses words like 'cringe', 'self-abasing', 'willing humiliation' and 'abject submission' and calls for the drawing of firm and polite lines with our ally. It says that our respect for the United States should not require abject submission and that our beliefs help define what sort of country we wish to be.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Exercising our democratic institutions and getting the support of the parliament to send our forces into a war or warlike situation should be one important principle of the Australia way. It would safeguard us from betraying other fundamental principles around the law and respect for human rights. This bill aims to ensure that, as far as is constitutionally and, importantly, practically possible, ADF personnel are not sent overseas to engage in warlike actions and deployments into combat zones without the approval of both houses of parliament. It is a very simple bill and I hope that senators have taken the time to read it. I know that Senator Faulkner has because, at the time that I introduced this bill, he was the defence minister. I can quite happily acknowledge now that I spoke to Senator Faulkner at the time and he told us that there was no support from the government on this bill historically. But he then at least paid this parliament the courtesy of reporting on the situation in Afghanistan. We could tell how much that cost you, Senator. Suddenly you are out attending funerals. You are getting briefings on just how serious the situation is there. You did the parliament the courtesy at least of pausing the rowdy and chaotic nature of the debate, which so often take off in trivial directions in here, by reporting on exactly what Australians were facing in the zones to which they were deployed.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">But then the minister sits down and nothing further happens. Maybe we can seek leave to make a short statement of dissent or acknowledgement, but the parliament cannot actually do anything about the situation that we as the representatives of the Australian people find ourselves in. If it is not possible, if we are not competent as legislators to hold this important trust with the Australian people, what is it about us that makes us different to legislators in Denmark, Finland, Germany, Ireland, Slovakia, South Korea, Spain, Sweden, Switzerland and Turkey, where troop deployment is set down in constitutional or legislative provisions? Some form of parliamentary approval or consultation is routinely undertaken in Austria, the Czech Republic, Italy, Japan, Luxembourg, the Netherlands and Norway. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">What is it about us as Australian legislaÂ­tors that we think we are not competent to step up and take responsibility for the bloodshed and misery that we would find ourselves in the position of having to duly authorise at some time? I think it is an act of absolute cowardice to avoid taking responsiÂ­bility, as we do in here on other matters every day on one side of the chamber or another, knowing full well the consequences of the vote that we are taking.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The relative maturity of the debate in the UK on the war powerâand the invasion of Iraq was vastly more costly in terms of British than in terms of Australian livesâhas resulted in several thorough inquiries and a new parliamentary convention whereby the executive commits to trigger a debate leading to a resolution of the parliament before a deployment is undertaken. So in the Westminster parliamentâthe origins of our own legislatureâthey are having a debate of vastly greater maturity to that which we have been subject to here in Australia, and they have changed. I think they have had a far more honest conversation with themselves about the disaster of Iraq and the ongoing misery in Afghanistan.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The bill before us was considered by the Senate's Foreign Affairs, Defence and Trade Legislation Committee, which reported in February 2010. Unfortunately, despite receiving 31 public submissions, the majoriÂ­ty of the committee declined to hold any public hearing to consider the legislation. It considered there was nothing really new to add to the debate.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Legislation seeking parliamentary input into decisions to send our troops to war was first put forward in the Senate in 1985. That is how long it has been, not since the debate begun, but since this parliament has had the instruments necessary to change this. It was put forward in 1985 by the former Australian Democrat Senator Colin Mason. In his second reading speech he pointed to the history of Australia's involvement in the Vietnam War. Not only was the parliament not consulted in the deployment of AustraÂ­lian defence personnel to fight in Vietnam but, as Senator Mason pointed out at the time, the Australian public were blatantly lied to by the government of the dayâit sounds familiar doesn't it?âwho stated that the deployment was in response to a call for help from the government of South Vietnam. The truth, of course, was completely differÂ­ent. It was a request for support that came from the government of the United States. Four hundred and ninety-two members of the ADF, including 187 conscripts, were killed in that war.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">When that bill was debated in this chamber on 17 April 1986, the then minister, Gareth Evans, said that the government sympathised with its underlying philosophy but the practical difficulties inherent in its application were such that it could not be supported. The bill was later reintroduced by Senator Mason's successor in New South Wales, Senator Paul McLean, and remained on the Senate's <span style="font-style:italic;">Notice Paper</span> throughout the 1990s. Similar legislation was reintroduced in the names of former Democrat Senators Bartlett and Stott-Despoja in March 2003, a week after the Senate quite clearly voted against the decision to commit Australian troops to war in Iraq.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">There is something interesting. A resolution was passed and the executive took absolutely no notice of it whatsoever. That is why we need this bill. The Labor and Liberal parties combined in the Senate to vote down a motion from Senator Bob Brown for a Senate committee to examine the legality of the government's deployment of troops to Iraq, the likely implications for international law of this action and what mechanisms could be used to require parliamentary consent for deployment of ADF personnel to hostilities overseas. We now know that the justification for providing Australian troops and assets to the Iraq invasion was, just as with Vietnam, a calculated deceit, driven primarily by a desire to provide political cover for the United States government's military agenda. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">When this legislation was debated by the Senate on 10 February 2005, which I think was the last time it was subject to any kind of debate in this place, former Labor Senator Linda Kirk expressed concerns about ambiguities in legislation, whilst some senators who spoke against the bill simply relied on supporting the Westminster traditionâwhich has now changedâto justify the status quo. Others asserted that there were definitional uncertainties as to how the bill would operate in practice. The majority Senate committee report tabled on the inquiry into this bill in February of last year, which was undertaken by the foreign affairs, defence and trade committee, said something interesting:</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Small">â¦ while wholeheartedly supporting debate in Parliament on any anticipated, proposed or actual deployment to overseas warlike operationsâ</span>

                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">which is the phrase that is used in the billâ</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Small">the committee cannot endorse this proposed legislation. â¦ the bill leaves too many critical questions unanswered â¦ while well intendedâ</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">there's that phrase againâ</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Small">the bill may have unforseen and unfortunate consequences that need to be identified and resolved before further consideration could be given to proposed legislation.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I find that language and the nuances in there really interesting. The foreign affairs, defence and trade committee majority repreÂ­sentation by the old parties did not say this was a bad idea. It said there were ambiguities and questions. It said this was difficult but it did not go ahead and propose any of the answers. It did not seek to push the debate or pursue it any further but it did not actually write the idea off because of course you could not, as legislators signing up to a committee report like that, tell the parliaÂ­ment, and through the parliament our constituents, that we were not competent to take that responsibility. Of course the committee did not do that.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">So, starting 25 years ago, right through until a Senate committee examined it last year, there were repeated comments expressÂ­ing sympathy for the intent of the bill while alleging practical problems with the content. Let's go into those details. The committee said the proposal should be examined carefully by various government departÂ­mentsâbut, of course, the committee did not want to hold a public hearing to hear from them directly.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Since I have been a member of the Joint Standing Committee on Foreign Affairs, Defence and Tradeâand I will be staying on as a full member of the committeeâI have received many letters, submissions and accounts from former soldiers and current serving defence personnel that have helped me better understand what, in my first speech, I put only in terms of financial costs. There are other enormous costs. There are open wounds in the lives of many Australians who have experienced the wars in Afghanistan and Iraq. As a parliament and as a society we must get better at supporting the people who return from war damaged and we must take responsibility for the people whose lives are ruined. There are such enormous costs.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The debate on who should be empowered to send Australian men and women to war is an enduring and persistent one. While it has been underway for decades now, each decade has brought lessons and experiences to inform and deepen the debateâand the sequence of unfortunate decisions leading Australian Defence Force personnel to be engaged in an illegal war in Iraq has I think prompted a renewed sense of its relevance. What I hope senators will address during the course of the debate, before it is adjourned later this afternoon, is that this bill is not intended to take out of the hands of the ADF the power to advise the executive. I am not asking parliament to take strategic decisions about how a deployment should occur and where assets should go. These are military decisions. We in the parliament are charged with making political decisions and we will leave the military decisions to the experts.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">But the decision whether or not to deploy is not a military one, in my view. The parliament does not need to be fully informed of operationally sensitive inforÂ­mation that would disadvantage us if an invasion or some form of deployment were to take place. That is a key distinction that I hope I am able to leave with senators as this debate gets underway. We are not seeking to usurp the power of the ADF or to look over their shoulder as these decisions are undertaken. But the decision whether or not to deploy is surely not a military one. We do not live in a military dictatorship. We do not live in Burma or North Korea. These are political decisions and we have to be prepared to take the responsibility.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">When the minister stands in the parliament to tell us about the latest death of a soldier in Afghanistan, we fall silent. But we very rarely hear about the deaths of those who are not Australian soldiersâthe enormous number of civilians killed accidentally or, as it is called, collaterally. We do not ever pause and reflect on that because it would paralyse this parliament if that were to occur. If we paused every time an Afghan civilian was killed, there would be no time to legislate. So we do not do that.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The last thing I would like to leave with the Senate is that we are not seeking to take decisions on operational matters out of the hands of the ADF. We are not seeking to have parliament briefed on sensitive defence issues that would give our purported enemies the upper hand. That is not what this bill seeks to do. This bill seeks to empower the parliament. If it is appropriate for this parliament to spend days and days debating all the matters we are employed to come in here and take responsibility forâsuch as aircraft safety regulations, livestock exports, road safety and healthâwhy on earth are we happy to delegate away our responsibility on the most serious decision a decision maker can make: the deployment of Australians into hostile situations from which they might not return? All I am asking for is the opportunity to have that debate in here.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Finally, I think we need to change the way we make these decisions. As other democraÂ­cies have evolved, subjecting the war power to a democratic process has become routine. It is even in the United States Constitution. As one of this bill's strongest and most prominent advocates recently saidâI am speaking of our dear Harry Evans, the former clerkâit's chances may appear to be slim at presentâ <span style="font-style:italic;">(Time expired)</span></span>

                    </a> (<span class="HPS-State">New South Wales</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">16:33</span>):  I have often argued that, of all the responsibilities of a national government, nothing is more important than the defence of the nation, its people and their interests. I also made the point to the Kokoda Foundation last yearâor perhaps it was in late 2009âthat force of arms alone cannot discharge that responsibility. In the modern world, we must confront and confound a far more varied range of threats and balance a far more complex range of priorities than purely military ones. The security of any nation and the safety of its citizens must depend on intelligence and diplomacy, on military power and moral suasion, on international cooperation and multinational coalitions. How the parliament and elected governments discharge this heavy responÂ­sibility is something that does warrant the closest parliamentary scrutiny and considerÂ­ation.</span>

                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">So I welcome the debate on the critically important issue of parliamentary approval for the deployment of Australian troops overseas. And I note too that the Australian Greensâand, before them, the Australian Democratsâhave over a number of years attempted to introduce legislative amendÂ­ments to require such an outcome. The first of many versions of this bill was introduced by former New South Wales senator Colin Mason, from the Australian Democrats, in 1985. Senator Mason introduced the Defence Amendment Bill 1985, which sought to require parliamentary approval in most circumstances before Australian troops could be deployed overseas. The bill proceeded to the second reading stage but, without government and opposition support, it did not pass. During debates over the deployÂ­ment of Australian troops to Iraq in 2003, Democrat senators Andrew Bartlett and Natasha Stott-Despoja introduced a private senator's bill, the Defence AmendÂ­ment (Parliamentary Approval for Australian Involvement in Overseas Conflicts) Bill 2003. That bill proposed to repeal and substitute section 50C of the Defence Act 1903, which allowed the deployment of Australian troops overseas and required both houses of parliament to approve a declaration of war and commitment of troops overseas. That bill did not pass. Senator Andrew Bartlett reintroduced a similar bill on 13 February 2008, the Defence AmendÂ­ment (Parliamentary Approval of Overseas Service) Bill 2008. Again, it did not pass.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Also, for the record I note that the final report of the 2020 summit from May 2008 includes on page 347 its support for 'an undertaking to allow a vote in both houses of parliament before (except in case of emergency) committing Australia to war or to a warlike situation'. The final report states that participants voted yes on this idea. The report goes on to say: </span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Senator Ludlam of the Australian Greens then introduced the Defence Amendment (Parliamentary Approval of Overseas Service) Bill 2008 (No. 2) to the Senate, on 17 September 2008. He said at the time: </span>

                  <span class="HPS-Small">The purpose of this bill is to ensure that, as far as is constitutionally and practically possible, Australian Defence Force personnel are not sent overseas to engage in warlike actions without the approval of both Houses of the Parliament.</span>

                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">It is of the view that the bill leaves too many critical questions unanswered to be considered a credible piece of legislation. It believes that, while well intended, the bill may have unforeseen and unfortunate consequences that need to be identified and resolved before further consideration could be given to proposed legislation.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">However, the committee did support debate in parliament on any anticipated, proposed or actual deployments to overseas warlike operations. Senator Bishop, as chair of the committee, said that the committee was mainly concerned with how the provisions of the bill would operate in practice. I think some of Senator Bishop's words are interestÂ­ing. He said:</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">The committee has identified a number of deficiencies in the bill that need to be attended to by those who are interested in this debate if the bill is going to be brought forward this time or some time in the future for passage.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The report included a dissenting report by Senator Ludlam, who indicated that the Australian Greens were disappointed in the report's findings. But, not to be discouraged, Senator Ludlam later that year introduced the Defence Amendment (Parliamentary AppÂ­roval of Overseas Service) Bill (No. 2) 2010 into the Senate. Again, the purpose of the bill is to prohibit any member of the Australian Defence Force from serving outside of Australia's territorial limits without parliamentary approval, subject to some specific exemptions.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">To complete the record, most recently, on 15 November 2010, the member for Melbourne, Mr Bandt, introduced the DefÂ­ence Amendment (Parliamentary ApproÂ­val of Overseas Service) Bill 2010. Again, the purpose of that bill was to prohibit any member of the Australian Defence Force from serving outside of Australia's territorial limits without parliamentary approvalâagain, subject to specific exemptions. That bill was not progressed.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">So the parliament has had a number of opportunities over the past quarter of a century to debate the issue of whether its approval should be obtained before the ADF is deployed overseas for warlike operations. The existing practice in Australia is that any decision to deploy members of the ADF beyond Australia's territorial limits is at the sole prerogative of the executive of the Commonwealth. I want to say here and now that I have supported and continue to support that power remaining a prerogative of the executive.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Under Australia's constitutional arrangeÂ­ments the executive power of the CommonÂ­wealth is vested in the Queen and exercisable by the Governor-General, who customarily acts on the advice of the government of the day. This power includes the decision to deploy the ADF to undertake combat operÂ­ations as well as a range of activities other than war fighting, such as peacekeeping operations and disaster relief. In practice, this power is exercised by the Prime Minister and other ministers. These decisions do not require an act of the parliament or a decision of the parliament. They are an exercise of executive power under section 61 of the Australian Constitution. The current governÂ­mentâconsistent with the views of previous governmentsâregards this longstanding constitutional practice as appropriate and does not support any proposal to alter these arrangements.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The February 2010 report of the Foreign Affairs, Defence and Trade Committee on the Defence Amendment (Parliamentary Approval of Overseas Service) Bill 2008 (No. 2) found that the bill 'leaves too many critical questions unanswered' and 'may have unforseen and unfortunate consequences'. Although I know it is often argued that parliamentary approval is required in certain other countries, it is not a logical conseÂ­quence to argue that such a position should apply in the Australian context. While it is true that the forms of parliamentary approval or parliamentary consultation are required in some other systems of government, it is very important to realise that such comparisons or analogies are, if not invalidated, then certainÂ­ly complicated by the major differences in the constitutional frameworks of these countries. I stress again: any decision to deploy military forces to combat is a most onerous and serious decision for a governÂ­ment to make. It is a very, very heavy responsibility. It is a life and death matter.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The bill that we are debating today does raise crucial issues that go to the powers of ministers, including constraints on those powers, the role of the executive and the parliament. It also raises some very critical issues about possible consequencesâI would say perhaps unintended consequences. The issue of placing constraints around a government's capacity to respond with the required urgency to an event remains a very serious concern. There has to be flexibility when time is of the essence. The risk of an operation commencing but then not receiving the approval of either house of the CommonÂ­wealth parliamentâeither the Senate or the House of Representativesâis a major concern to me. I never want to see Australian Defence Force personnel placed in a position of being involved in a dangerous operation and finding out subsequently that they are without legal authority or even legal protections. I am also concerned about how those defence operations that may be clandestine in nature or may be considered preparatory deployments are able to be accommodated within the provisions of this bill, particularly where the definition of 'warlike' and 'non-warlike' service can be unclear or ambiguous.</span>

                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We live and operate in the real world, and any legislation in here that we enact must be able to work in real life situations and it must be able to pass the real world test. Consistently, as Senator Ludlam said in his speech, I have not supported this legislation, but I do not want my opposition to the bill to be misinterpreted. I am strongly of the view that openness and transparency in governÂ­ment are at the heart of the democratic contract. I believe the public record shows, or I hope it doesâactions speak louder than words on thisâI have been very committed the entire time I have been in this parliament to ensuring that matters, including matters concerning the involvement of the ADF in conflicts, are open to the fullest possible public scrutiny and debate. When I was Minister for Defence I produced very regular and very detailed ministerial statements to the parliament on Afghanistan, and I very much commend that approach to ministers and to the parliament.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">While the government is not required to consult parliament after deploying forces overseas, inevitably we have seen some very robust parliamentary debate ensue after such deployments. I acknowledge that the parliament is in effect asked to endorse, if you like, a decisionâif it is asked to endorse it at allâtaken by the executive. However, there have been times when the very robust debate, including in this chamber, has led to the opposition of the day, and at least one house of the Australian parliament, opposing Australia's involvement in a conflict, or called for parliament to be better consulted on the war. The best example of this occurred in relation to Iraq in February 2003. I commend the amendment I moved to the ministerial statement of the then Leader of the Government in the Senate, Senator Hill, about Iraq. I proposed that the government of the dayâthat is, the Howard governmentâbe censured:</span>

                    </a>  Yes, but that was the view of the Australian Senate. You have to be fair about this; it was not the view of the House of Representatives, as you know. It is possible, of course, for the House of Representatives on a matter such as this to pass a motion of want of confidence in a Prime Minister. It did not occur on that occasion, and it has not occurred in Australian history since Federation. But that is just a fact of life. What Senator Ludlam asks us to doâand I think it is a perfectly reasonable questionâis to make clear that there is no misunderstanding on the issue of whether the decision to deploy is a military decision, and I see Senator Ludlam nodding. The decision to deploy is a civilian decision. It is a matter for the civilian government. It has been since Federation, it is now and I for one hope like hell it always will be. It must be. The issue here, Senator Ludlam, is which civilian authority. I respect your view that it should be both houses of the parliament, but you asked for clarity on this issue and you will get it from me. No questionâit should be a civilian authority. In my mind, no question that it should be executive governÂ­ment. I, too, accept the principle that it should be parliaments and only on certain occasions executive governments. It is a very risky business for civilians to get into operational matters. It is a very risky business indeed, and I support that principle, too, absolutely. I support the current system, but I do so on very strong grounds. <span style="font-style:italic;">(Time expired)</span></span>

                      <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Senator JOHNSTON</span>
                    </a> (<span class="HPS-State">Western Australia</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">16:54</span>):  I commence my response to this legislation, the Defence Amendment (Parliamentary Approval of Overseas Service) Bill 2010 [No. 2], by adopting and supporting the words of Senator Faulkner, who is very knowledgeable and wise on these matters and has had the heavy burden of responsibility upon him personally. I take what he said as a very good litmus test of the way to analyse this important responsibility. This is a very serious matter. The operation and mechanics of democratic principles in the deployment of troops beyond our borders is a matter of the utmost seriousness. It is at the very top of our responsibilities as parliamentarians. This bill is important and, to that extent and the seriousness surroundÂ­ing it, I thank Senator Ludlam for bringing it before the chamber and the parliament because it is an opportunity to re-evaluate and re-examine our disposition with respect to this very important subject.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Having said that, and having adopted the disposition and sentiments of Senator Faulkner, the opposition's perspective on this matter is very clear. In reviewing what has gone before, I am taken to the Senate Foreign Affairs, Defence and Trade References Committee report back in 2005. History there has set out that in 1985 Senator Colin Mason introduced to the Senate a bill of a similar nature to the one that Senator Ludlam has put before the Senate. He explained:</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">The purpose of this Bill is to place the responsibility for the decision to send Australian troops overseas with both Houses of Federal Parliament subject to exceptions covering the movement of personnel in the normal course of their peacetime activities and the need to take swift action in an emergency.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The bill was adjourned or lapsed in 1986 and was not pursued. Senator Paul McLean of the Australian Democrats picked it up and introduced it again in 1988 and, indeed, it was in very similar terms to Senator Mason's bill.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">On 27 March 2003, similar legislationânamely, the Defence Amendment (ParliaÂ­mentÂ­ary Approval for Australian InvolveÂ­ment in Overseas Conflicts) Bill 2003âwas introduced by Senator Andrew Bartlett and Senator Natasha Stott Despoja of the Australian Democrats. It was restored to the <span style="font-style:italic;">Notice Paper</span> on 17 November 2004 and debated in the Senate on 10 February 2005. The arguments in favour of and in opposition to the legislation built on those of 1986. A number of senators participated in the debate, which was then adjourned.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Finally, we come to the bill which was introduced by Senator Ludlam on 17 September 2008. I reiterate that it is a very healthy and useful process for us all to re-examine this very important piece of democratic practicality and principle in the way we deal with the deployment of Australian troops beyond our bordersâoverseas. Yes, there are a number of countries that do have strict parliamentary approval requirements. In the debates that have gone before, I note that Senator Hogg and Senator Marise Payne listed countries in 2005 where such approval was not necessary. They included Canada, Belgium, France, Poland, Portugal and the United Kingdom. The significance of mentioning those countries, particularly Canada and the United Kingdom, is that they have a particular relevance and I think we have a reasonable understanding of the synergies that exist between this parliament and their parliaments. In this regard, Senator Payne noted that different parliamentary systems, different parliamentary chambers, make different parliamentary arrangements. That is a very important point. The Senate report goes on to say of the committee:</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">For example, it noted that in some cases parliamentary approval may be needed to declare war but not to deploy troops and certain military service may not require approval.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">So there is a huge definitional and threshold-defining requirement for us to tie down how the parliament will, in the first instance, deal with the proposition that Australian troops be deployed overseas to apply lethal force. The UK government has debated this matter on a number of occasions. As the report says:</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">â¦ the UK Government recognised that the main challenge was to formulate a process that would be 'sufficiently adaptable to be able to respond quickly and flexibly to the variety of situations that could arise'.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I reiterate those words, 'to respond quickly and flexibly to the variety of situations that could arise'âsituations which may not be within our understanding or contemplation, given past history. The report continued:</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">It pointed to difficult issues that needed to be resolved such as allowing for exceptional circumstances, the need for urgent deployment, potential dangers of a retrospective approval process, security implications from the release of information, the timing of the vote and definitional issuesâ</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">as I have mentionedâ</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Small">such as 'armed conflict'.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">These concepts are all very fluid and can be, and very much will be, the subject of lengthy discussions.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The main question which was before the Senate committee, however, was not about the principle of parliamentary debate or approval but about whether the bill provided 'an effective or credible alternative to the current practice', and I think that is also a really important consideration for the Senate. Will the bill work in a way that imparts confidence and effectiveness in dealing with circumstances that require immediate attention? The committee was concerned, as I am, that this process will not fulfil those obligations or requirements. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">There are also concerns about the level of information that the chamber may have. As Senator Faulkner quite rightly emphasised, this is the real world: our strategic position cannot be disclosed to the public; our surveillance and reconnaissance information, its sources and its veracity cannot be disclosed or debated. So, almost of necessity, the debate will have to be held with all of us with one or both of our hands tied behind our backs with regard to classified material. Hence the parliament will be in a worse position, a much worse position, than the executive in terms of knowledge and understanding of the circumstances surrounÂ­ding a proposed deployment. Indeed, former senator Gareth Evans sympathised with the philosophy underlying parliamentary approÂ­val of such deployments, but he also said in 1986, when dealing with the original legislation:</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">â¦ situations may develop where there is a need to determine measures to be taken without the publicity associated with debate in the Parliament; situations where public knowledge could limit our strategic options and indeed put our forces at risk.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">They are very serious words. I think they very much determine where the government and the opposition sit on this particular question. Back in the debates of the 1980s, a very learned and talented former senator, Senator David MacGibbon, also identified a problem with the use of classified material. As the committee report states:</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">He argued that a decision to commit troops could be made 'only in the full knowledge of all the circumstancesâ</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">as I have indicatedâ</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">knowing the diplomatic circumstances that are involved, the strategic involvement and all the military and economic factors'. In his view, these must, 'be weighed up in the light of a careful assessment of all the options that are open to the government of the day. That simply cannot be done in open debate in any chamber of this parliament'.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Again, I think this is where this principle can lie with respect to the realities of and the necessity for information. Two decades later, senators opposing the 2003 version of the bill raised similar concernsâI also raised those concerns. As the committee report says:</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">Representing both major parties, they argued that the executive is the only body that has 'full and proper knowledge of military and strategic decisions and the one-on-one contact with Australian allies' to be able to make a considered and well informed decision. In their view, Parliament does not have access to all available intelligence and the complete range of advice from the Public Service.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Of necessity, a debate regarding the approval or otherwise of the deployment of Australian troops beyond our shores can never be a fully informed debate. Accordingly, the underlying problems with the mechanics of this legislation clearly mean that we cannot support it.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The senators of the day in 2003 and 2005 similarly rejected the alternative of providing parliament with all available intelligence to enable a fully informed debate. In their assessment, such an arrangement would be both impractical and detrimental to security. In particular, they were concerned that the disclosure of classified material, such as specific details on a deployment or intelliÂ­gence advice given to governments on a confidential basis, would compromise the safety and security of such an operation. I would like to quote former senator Linda Kirk, who made quite a contribution in her short time as a senator here. During the debate on this topic in 2005, she said:</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">There will often be cases where information simply cannot be made public. If it were to be made public it could very much undermine our strategic position when we are about to embark on a war. This could not even be overcome by holding a secret session of parliament, or something of the like, because that is contrary to our system of government and it would not be the proper manner in which to do this.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">As the committee report states:</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">For the major parties, the problems were seriousâthe inability of Parliament to have access to all the information needed to make critical decisionsâ</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Small">concerning the deployment of Australian ADF members or disclosing information that could jeopardise the safety and success of a military operation.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">That is a fundamental principle that we need to adhere to in the context of a realistic approach to the circumstances of the day.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The committee identified a number of deficiencies in the legislation it was considÂ­ering, which, as I said, was virtually identical to the bill before us today. As the committee's report said:</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">These deficiencies relate to the uncertainty and confusion about the use and application of terms such as war and non-warlike service and assumptions made about their application. The committee is also concerned about the nature of the resolution to be agreed to by both Houses of Parliament and about the extent to which it could impose conditions on deployment.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The debate on the matters in this bill has over the years been very thorough; these are important matters. That being the case, it is absolutely vital that, given our involvement in Iraq and Afghanistan, we revisit these matters on a regular basis. I think this debate has been a very healthy one, and I think that the issues have remained the same. In my submission, the detriment in this bill clearly outweighs the principle. No matter how positive are the underlying principles of this billâand the bill is laudableâthe impracÂ­ticality of full disclosure to the parliament in a strategic sense and where intelligence, diplomacy and classified documents are concerned means that we must continue with the system as it now stands. After all, it has served us well.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">
                    <a href="I0O" type="MemberSpeech">
                      <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Senator FEENEY</span>
                    </a> (<span class="HPS-State">Victoria</span>â<span class="HPS-MinisterialTitles">Parliamentary Secretary for Defence</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">17:09</span>):  I am pleased to have this opporÂ­tunity to speak on the Defence Amendment (Parliamentary Approval of Overseas Service) Bill 2010 [No. 2], the initial version of which the Greens introduced in 2008. This bill was the subject of an inquiry by the Senate Foreign Affairs, Defence and Trade Legislation Committee, which was chaired by my colleague Senator Bishop and reported in February last year. As the Senate knows, the committee's majority report recommended against proceeding with this bill, so it will come as no surprise when I say that the government will not be supporting it. Given that the opposition parties have today indicated that they too will also be opposing this bill, it is clear that we are now embarked upon nothing more than a ritualistic exercise.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This bill will not pass the Senate, and the Greens know why it will not. The Senate knows all the arguments for and against this bill, because this bill is the latest in a succession of similar bills stretching back to 1986 which were moved by the Greens and before them by the Australian Democrats. On each occasion that these bills have been brought before the Senate, the same arguments have been trotted out by its movers on the crossbenches and the same counterarguments have been trotted out by the government and by the opposition of the day. Senator Ludlam, in the second reading speech he incorporated into the <span style="font-style:italic;">Hansard </span>in September last year, has done no more than repeat the arguments that were made by former Senators Stott Despoja, Bartlett, McLean and Mason in debates on earlier manifestations of this bill. So it is no surprise that the arguments I am going to put forward in opposition to this bill are essentially the same arguments that have been put by Labor and the coalition parties in earlier debates; nor is it a surprise they are the same arguments that were made in the majority report of the Senate Foreign Affairs, Defence and Trade Legislation Committee.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The gist of the bill and of Senator Ludlam's second reading speech is that the executive of government should not have the power to commit Australia's defence forces outside Australia without the approval of both houses of parliament. The bill does provide an exemption from this requirement in an emergency situation, when forces could be deployed via proclamation by the Governor-General, but such a proclamation would have to be retrospectively approved by both houses of parliament. The justification that its advocates have put forward for this proposal is that a decision to commit Australian forces outside Australia is too important to be left to the executive government. On the face of it, this is an attractive propositionâthere are few more important decisions a nation can take than to send its armed forces into harm's way. The decision to put the lives our service men and women at risk is indeed a grave responsiÂ­bility that no democratic government takes lightly. I note that previous speakers have spoken very eloquently on that point and on the responsibilities that flow from the deployment of our armed forces.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">There are, however, weighty arguments to be put against this superficially attractive proposition. The most important of these are as follows. Firstly, there is the incompatÂ­ibility of this proposal with the Westminster system of government, most particularly in a bicameral parliament. Secondly, there is the difficulty of expecting a legislature to make such a decision when it does not and cannot have the full range of information it would need to make such a decision. Thirdly, there is the fact that our defence forces need clear and unambiguous terms of deployment and the flexibility to respond to situations in which they find themselves.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I now address each of these points in turn. It has always been a principle of the Westminster system that the parliament legislates, but the executive governs. The executive was once the Crown; today it is the cabinet acting in the name of the Crown. The parliament decides what the law should be, but it is the executive which then puts those laws into effect. When there is a dispute about the meaning of the law, it is resolved by an independent judiciary. This is the separation of powers, and it is, of course, one of the foundations of our highly successful system of government. The Constitution gives this parliament the power to legislate in the area of defence, and the parliament has done so by creating the Australian Defence Force and the defence department to administer it. The Minister for Defence is the executive head of that department, and he recommends to cabinet how, when and where the ADF should be deployed. That is an executive decision, not a legislative one. The role of the legislature is to legislate, not to manage the implementation of the laws that it passes. Thus, the parliament creates immigration law but it does not decide which individuals will get visas. The parliament creates social security laws but it does not determine individual pension cases. The same principle should apply in the field of defence. It is open to this parliament to pass laws which regulate the manner in which the ADF should be deployed. It is not the proper function of parliament to make executive decisions about such deployments.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This does not, of course, mean that the parliament is powerless in these important matters. Under the Westminster system, the government holds office only so long as it has the confidence of the lower house of the parliament. If the parliament wishes to overturn an executive decision, whether in defence or, indeed, anywhere else, it can do so by censuring the minister or perhaps by passing a vote of no confidence in the government.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The violation of Westminster principles that this bill represents is made worse by the fact that it stipulates that the deployment of forces outside Australia will require the support of both houses. I am sorry as a senator to have to say this, but it is a cardinal Westminster principle that the government relies on the support of the lower house of parliament. The government does not need the confidence of the Senateâalthough, let me say, we prefer to have it. We have a bicameral legislature in which the two chambers are frequently controlled by different parties. There have only been nine years since the 1950s in which a government has had the majority in the Senate. This bill, if passed, would make the ability of a government to make executive decisions in the field of defence dependent on the support of a house which is deliberately designed by the system of proportional representation not to have a government majority. This is unsound in constitutional theory and would be completely unworkable in practice.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I turn now to the issue of the ability of the parliament to exercise the kind of quasi-executive role which this bill would create for it. One of the advantages of a system of executive government is that it enables decisions to be made by people who are in full possession of the information which is necessary for those decisions to be made properly and which cannot, by its nature, be public. This principle operates in all fields of government, whether it is taxation, immiÂ­gration or pensions. This parliament passes taxation legislation, but parliament does not, and should not, have before it the details of every individual taxpayer so that it can decide how much tax they should pay. That matter is decided by officials who have a professional obligation to preserve the confidentiality of the information they have access to. If that is true of taxation, then it is immeasurably true of defence.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This bill would create a situation in which one of two highly undesirable things would have to happen: either the parliament would have to make a decision about approving or not approving deployment outside Australia, without possessing the intelligence information upon which such a decision should be based; or, alternatively, the parliament would have to require that all such intelligence information be provided to it so it could then make an informed decision. That would, of course, run the grave risk of exposing our defence personnel in fact to increased danger, and it would also immediately end all forms of intelligence cooperation between Australia and its allies. As anybody who has worked in the defence space comprehends, that would of itself be a grave blow to Australia's security.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">It has been suggested that parliament could hold sessions in camera in which confidential information could be given, as was done by the Churchill government in the United Kingdom during World War II. In fact, the purpose of those meetings was to share confidential political information, not details of operational matters. Mighty parliaÂ­mentarian though he was, Winston Churchill would never have dreamed of allowing the House of Commonsâlet alone, I might say, the House of Lordsâto usurp the role of the executive government to make operational decisions about where, when and why British forces should be deployed. I do not think there can be any doubt that any confidential information given to a closed session of the parliament might soon be leaked, negating the entire purpose of the exercise.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Let me now address the most serious problem that this bill would create. The bill says:</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">â¦ members of the Defence Force may not serve beyond the territorial limits of Australia except in accordance with a resolution, which is in effect and agreed to by each House of the Parliament, authorising the service.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This bill does create various exemptions from this proscription, such as for peaceÂ­keeping and humanitarian purposes, but these do not substantially detract from the basic purpose of the bill, which is to prohibit the deployment of the ADF outside Australia for operational purposes without the authorÂ­isation of both houses of parliament. The Senate may note that the bill does not specify that parliamentary approval is needed only when the purpose of deploying forces outside Australia is to take part in a war. It applies to all deployments of the ADF, unless they meet one of the exempt categories specified in the bill.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">It is regrettable, to put it mildly, that, after more than 15 years of intermittent debate of this issue in the House and in the Senate, the proponents of this bill still have not addressed the basic problem that it createsâthat is, it would make the effective and flexible operation of our defence forces impossible. The bill would require specific parliamentary approval every time the Navy proposed sending a ship or a submarine outside Australia's territorial waters. It would require parliamentary approval every time the Royal Australian Air Force proposed to fly an aircraft to New Zealand, Papua New Guinea, East Timor or the Solomon Islands, or to fly a patrol over the Southern Ocean or the Tasman Sea. It would require the disclosure of each and every operational activity of the ADF outside our own territory.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The proponents of the bill will no doubt argue that these missions will usually come within one or another of the exemptions provided for in the bill. But this ignores the fact that the exact purpose of many ADF operations cannot and should not be disclosed, so it would not be possible to tell the parliament whether any given deployÂ­ment would or would not come within those exemptions. The ADF should not be required to disclose this information. This bill would put the ADF in a position of having to choose between disclosing operational secrets and misleading the parliaÂ­ment. Of course the ADF would remain true to its duty and its situation would become impossible.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The bill provides an exemption for deployments conducted for non-warlike purposes, but this fails to address one of the basic facts of military life: it is not possible to know in advance what our forces may encounter when they are conducting operations. A mission to Somalia, for example, may be exempted from the provisions of this bill because its intention is humanitarian assistance, but what happens if such a mission were to come under attack, which is not only perfectly possible but has been witnessed in countries with no effective government? Will the ADF be required to seek resolutions of both of houses of parliament before its members can defend themselves?</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This bill would be not only very harmful to the operations of our defence forces but also quite unnecessary. The fact is that Australian forces are never operationally deployed to wars or warlike situations without vigorous parliamentary debate. That was true of both world wars, of Korea, Malaya, Vietnam, the Gulf War, East Timor, the Iraq war and, of course, Afghanistan. Every one of these deployments has been debated, sometimes at great length and with great passion and even with great bitterness, in our democratic parliament, and that is exactly as it should be. The government of the day has had to justify its course of action before the parliament, and every three years it has to justify its actions before the people. Governments are also subject to relentless scrutiny in the media, and that again is as it should be.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Let me also take this moment to reflect on the fact that the Department of Defence and the ADF are organisations which are solidly committed to the principle of transparency in government. We of course have a budget process, where the structures of the various components and force elements inside the ADF are matters of public knowledgeâthey are not secret. We have an estimates process in which Defence can be thoroughly scrutinised by this parliamentâand, of course, it is. In a whole range of ways information about Australian defence forces is publicly available.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The government and previous governÂ­ments have long asserted the virtue of the fact that, through that transparency and that clarity, we provide ourselves and our neighbours with a clear sense of what the tasks of the Australian defence forces are. The white paper clearly sets out the strategic context in which this government and this country are building its ADF capabilities. This, unfortunately, does stand in contrast to other nations which continue to shroud their militaries and their strategic thinking behind veils of secrecy. But that is not something that has been a tradition in Australia. This transparency is a virtue of this government, previous governments, the ADF and the Department of Defenceâand it will long continue to be so.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">For all these reasons, the government remains resolutely opposed to this bill, as all governments have been since this proposal was first raised in 1985. I commend the government's position to this Senate and I trust that the Senate will once more reject this bill.</span>

                    <a href="2L6" type="MemberSpeech">
                      <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Senator MARK BISHOP</span>
                    </a> (<span class="HPS-State">Western Australia</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">17:25</span>):  In my contribution to this debate on the Defence Amendment (Parliamentary Approval of Overseas Service) Bill 2010 I want to some extent to go over ground already covered but address a range of issues that are relevant to the discussion. I want to discuss the submisÂ­sions, the history of the debate, the history of the bill, what I believe to be the real purpose behind the billâas opposed to its ostensible purposeâleading to a discussÂ­ion on the role of the executive and why I believe that the current practice of the executive making decisions as to the deployment of Australian forces should be retained and then perhaps conclude, if time permits, by making some comments about the role of information and its disclosure and what I believe to be common ground; that is, the necessity for extensive public debate on these matters where we deploy troops or service people overseas into war zones, conflicts, wars or however the area is properly described.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">At the outset, let me express some comments that I have not to date put on the public record. When the committee's report was delivered to the Senate, for reasons that I do not recall, the three principal speakers were each limited to four or five minutes in the comments they could make. There may have been some time restrictions, for whatever reason. I had intended to make some comments about the decision of the government or the Department of Defence not to make a submission to the inquiry and, for whatever reason, I failed to do so. I do think it has been a glaring omission in this particular bill inquiry that our government or the Department of Defenceâand, arguably, the Attorney-General's DepartmentâdeliberÂ­ately chose not to make a submission to the inquiry. I have a memory of approaching both Dr Watt and then Minister Faulkner and requesting them to authorise the department to make a decision. I was assured that a submission would be received but none was forthcoming.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Why is that important? It is important because this has clearly been an issue in this parliament since at least 1985. There have been successive attempts by minority parties to change the current practice of executive decision making and shift it to one or both houses of parliament as to the deployment of troops overseasâif I can characterise it in that wayâand a range of present and past senators have put their thoughts on the record. Indeed, I much appreciate the contribution just put by Senator Feeney, the Parliamentary Secretary for Defence, because his contribution, to a significant extent, did address some of the core issues as to why my party and the opposition partyâalthough I cannot speak for themâare resolute in our opposition to changing the practice of the executive making decisions. He outlined those details, the reasoning, the history and the thought processes involved more than adequately.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">It would have been most useful if the department or the government had chosen to put that material on the public record in the bill inquiry organised by Senator Ludlum, because they are important reasons, they are germane to discussion and they heavily influence the deliberations of a whole range of people in this parliament and outside the debate. There is no reason ever for governÂ­ments or departments not to put their reasoning in an informed way on the public record as to how decisions are being madeâand it is regrettable that that did not occur.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I must also, I suppose, be somewhat critical because, if this issue is as important or as critical as Senator Ludlum, on behalf of the Greens, suggests that it is, I would have anticipated that there would have been a groundswell of community interest, support or agitation around the issue apart from that expressed by political representatives of the Greens in debates in this place. In fact, it is my observation that there has been minimal interest and minimal commentary, apart from the aficionados who pay attention to this debate, for many years. I draw the conclusion that that is because, in the wider Australian community, there is, by and large, satisfaction with the processes that successÂ­ive governments have adopted for the commitment and deployment of armed personnel into war zones and to participate in warlike activity in war zones.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Indeed, because the government chose to not make a submission to the inquiry when we were going through that process, I paid more than ordinary attention to the 30-odd submissions that had been put in by interested groups and individuals. Normally I glance at them, make myself familiar with the main arguments and put them away for use in public inquiries. This time I paid a lot of attention. I was surprised, because of the 31 submissions only 12 or 13 supported the notion of prior parliamentary approval, but those 12 or 13 submissions were one-page form letters and merely asserted the need to have parliamentary approval as opposed to executive determination.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Assertions are fine and they reflect the belief of a group or an individual, but you need more than mere assertion on a point to carry the point. One would have thought that, after four or five lengthy debates in this place and a huge amount of material on the public record, the groups and individuals who assert the need to change a system that has been around for hundreds and hundreds of years would have more than mere assertion as the justification for change. Unfortunately, that was not the case. Indeed, six of the 31 submissions supported the bill by reference only to its content, eight proposed alternative forms or amendments of substance, and four or five opposed the bill. Having made those comments, only some six, eight or 10 submissions of the 30-odd addressed the content of the bill and the technical deficiencies, shortcomings or amendments thereto.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">If one tracks back on the debate that occurred today and previous debatesâat least four or five, going back to 1985, and I think the first was by an Australian Democrat senatorâgovernments and oppoÂ­sitions constantly identified technical deficiencies in the bill. That was put in written reports and it was requested that the submitters attend to those deficiencies. What that indicates is that the government of the day or the opposition of the day show a mature approach to the argument, give it consideration, say that there are a heap of issues and problems, and ask: what is the solution to them? And we get no response. That led me again to the conclusion that those who position themselves for change in this debate are perhaps not as serious as they might think they are, because they choose to not do the hard work of addressing either technical deficiencies in drafting or strategic and technical considerations that are necessary considerations as part of the process of deploying troops overseas.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">As has been identified by other speakers in this debate today, and it is certainly attested to in discussion in the committee report, there have been many years of consideration of this matter. A host of passing senators in the Australian DemocratsâSenators Mason, McLean, Chipp and Bartlettâused, in substance, the same bill every time they reintroduced the bill. Indeed, the bill being put forward by Senator Ludlam today is in substanceâat its heart, at its coreâidentical, or that close to identical that it does not matter, to previous bills advanced by parties that have been subsumed by the Australian Greens.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Let us now turn to what I surmise to be the core purpose of those advancing this billâtoday by Senator Ludlam and the Greens, and in past debates, by and large, by various representatives of the Australian Democrats. It is always paraded as being about issues of participation and democÂ­racyâthat the parliament is the supreme decision-making body in this country and it should participate and decide if we are going to send troops to war. As Senator Feeney said, it is a somewhat attractive proposition. But I think the real purpose behind this bill, and the real purpose behind its incarnation in previous forms, is to simply prevent the Australian government from having the ability to send armed services overseas under any circumstance. I say that upon considerÂ­ation and reflection. I come to that conclusion simply because those who put forward the issue for change never, ever move beyond the point of assertion in their debate.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">What is the current position? It is as Senator Feeney outlined. If we are going to send people overseas, it is a decision of the executive, the Prime Minister and cabinet, and that is an inherited position from the Crown. If the government of the day gets it wrong, or gets it bad, or messes up, or is incorrect in its reasoning, it can pay a terrible price. Every three years or every six years, if our commitment to troops overseas is proving to be fallible, or unwarranted, or unnecessary, or too costly, or not satisfying original purpose, we, particularly in the major parties, face the ultimate test. If it is a matter of such consideration, the people will just say: 'You're wrong. You're no longer justified being in government. We will give the other mob a go.' That is the first point.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The second point I want to address in more detail goes to the heart of the debate. It goes to the issue of security, confidentiality and military matters. It goes to issues of deployment, issues of numbers, issues of capability, issues of disposition and issues of purpose. They are all considered in the context of a strategic and military decision making. Why, in the final analysis, do a lot of members of the government and a lot of members of the opposition say, 'The proposition of the Australian Greens is simply a bridge too far'? Why do we say that this decision making should be retained to the executive and not transferred to 220-odd elected members in both houses of parliament? We say it for this reason: consideration by the executive is necessarily secret and confidential. It goes to the deployment of assets of a capital nature and personnel. It involves them going into war zones where they are likely to be injured or killed. We say that that process of decision making is properly kept secret and properly retained only in the hands of the executive and properly only known to those who need to know it. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Whilst we as members of parliament might think that we are so important that we should be consulted or that we should know what is going on in Afghanistan or Iraq in terms of operations, that is a sop to our vanityâthat is all. Because if we do wish to know what is going onâand as Senator Ludlam well knows, because he is a member of the Senate foreign affairs committee, and I know because I have been on that committee for many yearsâregularly, we and the joint committee receive private briefings from senior officers on a whole range of operational matters, on capital acquisition matters that go to commercial-in-confidence, on security matters and on a whole range of other things. Indeed, regularlyâthree times a year in estimatesâsenators will ask questions of CDF, Chief of Navy, Chief of Army, whoever is there, and occasionally we are told: 'Listen, Senator, that goes to matters that are not properly in the public domain. If you want to know, we are more than happy to provide a private briefing and take you through what you want to find out.' And our committee and other committees of this parliament from time to time take up the offer and we are informed on a range of matters occurring in the military or the security field that are not appropriate to be on the public record.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">So it is not a matter of this body in the executive having only and sole knowledge. Representatives of the broader population can avail themselves of that knowledge, but it is done in a different way, in a private way, because those whom we seek to inflict harm upon or who seek to inflict harm upon us do not need to know how we are going to do it or when we are going to do it or why we are going to do it. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">In that context, I must say that there is precious little in the Australian defence forces that is not publicly known and not on the public record. Indeed, in more latter years, I have come to the view that perhaps there is too exhaustive inquiry into a lot of matters that are going on in Defenceâtoo many committees covering the same game. We regularly in this place have ministers of the Crown making public statements on deployments in Iraq or Afghanistan or East Timor or the Solomons. We go through the estimates process three times a year, particularly the May budget. It is no mean feat to sit there for two days, 12 hours each day, on defence and have officers on the other side of the table literally facing hundreds or thousands of questions as to all aspects of their work. There are a large number of committees that regularly inquire into a whole range of aspects that go to capability, capability acquisition, disposition of forces and procurement matters. There are particular intelligence and security committees that in this parliament are charged with the oversight of agencies that engage in that sort of activity.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Members of parliament, particularly in the last five, six or seven years, have been more than diligent in examining and questioning the senior officers of the Australian military forces in the most public of forums, where every word is written down and is often examined by 10 or 12 senators or members of parliament at once. That is a very effective regimeâa very, very effective routineâof obtaining information.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">
                    <span style="font-style:italic;" />The conclusion, again, that I draw is that a lot of information that perhaps in past decades may not have been readily available or had been covered up or not disclosed for a range of reasons is now regularly put out in the public domain. Indeed, I regularly read the opinion polls and, not surprisingly, I think a majority of people in this country are opposed to our involvement in Afghanistan. I do not really quarrel with that conclusion. I think probably a majority of the population does not favour the government's decision to put troops there, keep troops there and keep them there for a number of years into the future. But because this government and previous governmentsâministers of the Crown, regularlyâand those who are engaged in this national security debate regularly make speeches on these sorts of topics, a lot of information is out there, and the wider community is not concerned that it is being misled, being misinformed, being underinformed or does not know what is going on. They know why we are in Afghanistan. They know why we are fighting there. They know the cost. They know the number of deaths. They know the justification. There is considerable public information. So the process of parliamentary review, parliamentary oversight, parliaÂ­mentary knowledge is absolutely essential; Senator Ludlam is correct on that point, butâ <span style="font-style:italic;">(Time expired)</span></span>

                    </a> (<span class="HPS-State">New South Wales</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">17:45</span>):  I rise to follow Senator Bishop's contribution to this debate on the Defence Amendment (Parliamentary Approval of Overseas Service) Bill 2010 [No 2]. I was certainly very interested to hear Senator Bishop's contribution because, as a very longstanding member of the Senate and the Joint Standing Committee on Foreign Affairs, Defence and Trade, he is probably one of the most knowledgeable people in this parliament now that we have lost some of our long-serving senators from that committee, and he does understand exactly how often and how scrupulously this issue has been investigated and debated over the years.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The fundamental issue we all have to understand here is that since 1901 neither the Australian Constitution nor defence legislation has required governments to actually gain parliamentary approval for the decision to deploy forces overseas or, in the rare cases that it has occurred, as Senator Feeney and Senator Bishop both explained, to actually declare war. There have been attemptsâas Senator Bishop, who rememÂ­bers the time in 1985, saidâby the Australian Democrats and, more recently, by the Australian Greens to remove that exclusive power of government to commit Australia to war. What a serious issue this is for all of us to consider today.</span>

                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">When, in February last year, the Senate Foreign Affairs, Defence and Trade Legislation Committee reported on the then Australian Greens bill, the committee conÂ­cluded that the bill could not be considered to be a credible piece of legislation and recommended that the bill not proceed. The committee also stated:</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Small">The committee is not in any way against the involvement of both Houses of Parliament in open and public debates about the deployment of Australian service personnel to warlike operations or potential hostilities. It agrees with the views of most submitters that the Australian people, through their elected representatives, have a right to be informed and heard on these important matters.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Senator Bishop took the time and the trouble to go through the 31 submissions to the inquiry and reflected on how many of those supporting the legislation were actually a form letter going to certain parts of the billâmost were not. This goes to the very point that the Australian people expect the government of the day to be competent and confident in having to make a call to deploy our forces overseas. They expect that of us; that is what we as a government have a responsibility to do. That decision is an extraordinary decision to be made and it is one that is the prerogative and the responsibility of the executive government.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The purpose of the bill that we are debating is to ensure that, as far as is constitutionally and practically possible, Australian Defence Force personnel are not sent overseas to engage in warlike actions without the approval of both houses of parliament. Mr Bandt, who introduced this bill in the House of Representatives, actually acknowledges that the bill is a revised version of the bill first introduced into the Senate in 1985, so we are revisiting this as if it is Groundhog Day. I do not think it does this place much service that we continue to go over old ground. As Senator Bishop said, the inquiries have demonstrated where the shortcomings in the legislation are, yet the proponents who keep putting it up have not actually addressed the deficiencies of those bills.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The challenge for us is really to understand what the purpose of the bill is. As Senator Bishop said, what is the real intent, what are the principles that are really under debate here, what is this bill all about and what might its real impacts be, and what are the consequences of actually enacting this kind of legislation? Let us start to think about those issues. First of all, I do not think it would be unfair to say that the bill has been drafted from the view of people who have never actually been involved in executive government and, quite frankly, are not ever likely to be. Understanding the issues, the way in which the cabinet processes work and the way in which the executive government works would really reflect how important it is that this power resides within.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">As Senator Bishop said, and as people have said over and over in the debate, the real test of the decisions of the executive government is the election every three years. If the Australian people are not happy with the way the government of the day deals with supports and makes decisions around the deployment and resourcing of our defence forcesâthe most critical function of the defence forces of our nationâthen they can take their voice to the ballot box and make their concerns known.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We have seen, from my memory, that this has not been an issue. Perhaps the first Iraq war was an issue that was very much in the public debate around an election campaign, but since that time there has been bipartisan support for the decisions we have made about protecting our sovereignty and ourÂ­selves and also about being the international citizens that we profess to be and taking our share of the load as members of a global peacekeeping force and global military action. We do not commit our troops, our defence personnel, lightly, and we certainly understand the seriousness of actually engagÂ­ing in warlike activities. The importance of all of that comes to the second point that Senator Bishop just made, which I thought was very important and goes to the fact that the executive makes a decision based on very important confidential and national security issuesâbriefings and information that should not be in the public domain. There is sometimes a case where we think that, just because we want to know, we should know. We sometimes confuse the issue of the right to know and the need to know, and I think the responsibility that lies heavily and very responsibly with the executive government is the fact that there is intelligence advice given to governments on a confidential basis that can only be told to the government of the day for very important reasons. This is a principle that we have upheld since 1901, and I do not see that there is any reason why we would need to change this now. Certainly the proponents of this legislation have not made the case to do so.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">While I have some time I would like to go to some of the changes in the impacts. This comes from the explanatory memorandum of this bill. I will go through some of the amendments here. The first ones that I really want to focus on are subsections (7), (8) and (9), providing for situations in which the parliament is not meeting when a so-called proclamation by the Governor-General is made. The bill wants the Governor-General to make a proclamation and the advice is provided by the Prime Minister stating the reasons for a deployment, its legal authority, its geographical extent, its expected duration and the number and members of the forces to be involved. That information is requested in this legislation to be put into the public domain.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Let us think about what the implications of all of that are, for starters. That kind of information is not necessarily available to the public nowâand for very sensible reasons. For the security of our defence forces themselves, some of that information certainly should not be in the public domain. So let us think. First of all we have the parliament being consulted at the earliest possible time about the emergency and the deployment of forces overseas. We also have the proposal that, if the parliament is not in sessionâthat is, it has been adjourned indefinitely or for more than two daysâthe Presiding Officer of the House is to summon the House to meet within two days after the proclamation is made.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We finish today for five weeks. In those five weeks I know every member of this parliament has a program of work around our committee responsibilities, overseas travel et cetera. There are amazing commitments that people try to lock into these periods when we are away from the parliament. This is proposing that at short noticeâwithin two daysâthe Presiding Officer would reconÂ­vene the parliament. Besides the expense and inconvenience, it is a nonsense that that should be the case.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">If the parliament is proroguedâsubsection (8) of this bill:</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">In that circumstance, a proclamation is to cease to have effect seven days after it is made.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">What this does is provide for situations of a parliament having been prorogued before a proclamation has been made or having been prorogued within seven days of a proclamation being made. In both cases the proclamation ceases after seven days and no similar proclamation can be made until the parliament meets again. Think about the outcome of the last federal election, when in fact the final results were not known for several weeks after the election date. It is an unworkable piece of legislation that we have before us. It really makes no sense at all. The effect of subsection (8) is that, if the government deploys forces overseas in an emergency while the parliament is prorogued and the government intends that the deployment continue beyond seven days, the government will be compelled to advise the Governor-General to summon the parliament to meet within that period to seek parliaÂ­mentary approval for the deployment. So you can see that this is quite an illogical approach to the very serious issue of deploying our troops.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We cannot be seen to be at the will of the parliament to call people into account for serious warlike activities. Perhaps we should take the example of RAMSI and the deployment of our defence personnel to the RAMSI forces and the incidents that have happened in the Pacific. You think, 'How does that fit practically into what is being suggested in this legislation?' Senator Feeney talked about deployment of defence personnel to emergency situations. We have had amazing accolades for the work that our fantastic personnel have done in Japan after the recent earthquake and tsunamiâhow they mobilised from New Zealand and were instantly able to respond and provide expertise in those circumstances.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I read another part of this, which is about creating hostilities. How do we understand the circumstances in a very volatile situation where something escalates because of the breakdown of civil society? In those circumstances, something that is seen to be peacekeeping can suddenly escalate into something far worse. We saw some of that in East Timor, where our troops had made an amazing impact in peacekeeping and reducing hostilities. Looking at how we have deployed our defence personnel across the Pacific, I think that we really see where the potential is for that blurring of the lines to come into play. So the committee was right in recommending that this was not a workable piece of legislation. It is not a workable piece of legislation now. It actually creates extraordinary pressures on our defence forces and it creates extraordinary pressures on our individual members. But, of course, what it does is deny the executive government of the day their responsibility and their need to be the ones that take responsibility for deploying our defence personnel. This legislation places significant limits on the government that are a nonsense.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I rise to speak on the report of the Joint Select Committee on the Christmas Island Tragedy, which was established on 2 March 2011 to inquire into the incident on 15 December 2010 in which a boat full of men, women and children, now known as suspected illegal entry vessel 221, foundered on rocks on Christmas Island. The committee heard how just after dawn the unexpected boat was sighted in appalling weather conditions a few hundred metres from shore, seemingly unaware that relative safety could be found on the more protected east side of the island, where HMAS <span style="font-style:italic;">Pirie</span> and ACV <span style="font-style:italic;">Triton</span> were sheltering. SIEV221 pushed on towards the nearest part of Christmas Island. In what was to be a fateful turn of events, the vessel lost power and began drifting towards Rocky Point, with rescue boats still half an hour away at this time. The committee heard and saw horrifying evidence of how the boat impacted, by then completely at the mercy of the sea, against the rocky shore. What happened next was, first and foremost, a human tragedy. Forty-one people were pulled from the sea by Navy and Customs crew. One man, through sheer strength and considerable luck, managed to struggle up the razor-sharp rock to safety. Thirty of the deceased were found during the rescue and recovery effort. Twenty people were never found and are, of course, presumed dead. Three children were orphaned by this tragedy. Parents lost young children. People lost husbands, wives, brothers and sisters. Their grief is immeasurable.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">It is with deep sympathy for the deceased and their families that the committee undertook to address in its terms of reference and to assess whether the rescue effort and after-incident support were everything they could have been. It is also with deep respect for the deceased, their families and the survivors of this tragedy that this report unreservedly praises the efforts of the rescuers and attributes to their heroic efforts the fact that 41 human beings were pulled alive from those turbulent seas. Having stood on those cliffs at Rocky Point, imagining the sheer force of the sea in atrocious weather, it is the view of the committee that it is remarkable that anyone at all survived. We could well have seen a different outcome if it were not for the rescuers, who put their own safety on the line to save others. This report unequivocally concludes that the rescue effort mounted by Customs and the Navy was of the highest order against the most trying circumstances.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The committee received a range of submissions from survivors, asylum seeker advocacy groups, government agencies and others. The committee appreciates the ongoing emotional impact of this tragedy on everyone involved and understands that these emotions are in many cases, understandably, still quite raw. The committee did its best to approach this inquiry, and each witness and submitter, with the utmost sensitivity. On behalf of the committee, I extend our gratitude to everyone who made submissions and gave evidence. The committee is aware that a large number of people who chose not to provide evidence to this inquiry were nonetheless deeply affected by the tragedy.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Of particular note are Christmas Island residents who, with little or no training, did all they could on the day, gathering lifejackets and other flotation aids and throwing them to people struggling in the water. Together with the Australian Federal Police officers, they formed a human chain to get closer to the edge in a bid to reach survivors. The committee heard that without these lifejackets it is certain that many more people would have perished. The committee also heard how helpless residents felt on the day, watching these horrific scenes unfolding and how they wanted to do more. These are all normal human reactions. The committee hopes this report will remind residents on Christmas Island that their admirable efforts were not in vain, quite the opposite. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">From the onset of inquiry we set out to ensure that residents were being provided with the best possible ongoing support should they feel they need it. I speak for the committee in praising the effort and dedication of staff with the Indian Ocean Territories Health Service, who caredâand continue to careâfor the Christmas Island community in direct and in indirect ways. The committee also acknowledges that government agencies made their own counsellors available to the community for some time after the tragedy and concludes that the support provided for residents was appropriate to their needs.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">For the residents of Christmas Island, daily life serves as an inescapable reminder of the tragedy. When the committee learned that the Department of Immigration and Citizenship was planning to build a memorial for those who perished in the tragedy, it supported this decision but stressed that this should be done with sensitivity and in consultation with the island community. The report includes a recomÂ­mendation to this effect in order to highlight just how important it is to help the community heal.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The committee also examined the care and support provided for the survivors and government agency staff. These two groups of people were affected in different but equally important ways. This inquiry focused extensively on the after-incident support provided for both groups. In both cases, after pursuing the matter with departmental officers, the committee was satisfied that all agencies fulfilled their duty of care with sensitivity and the utmost professionalism. The committee heard extensive evidence from senior DIAC officers on a number of issues around the care and support provided for the survivors and notably the specific needs of the three orphaned children. The committee found that everything that was done was done with the survivor's interests as the foremost concern. Psychological wellbeing and privacy were prioritised and for this the committee commends DIAC unreservedly.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">While the committee assessed all available evidence anew, this inquiry was conducted with the benefit of the findings of two earlier examinations of the incident, the report of the Christmas Island Emergency Management Committee and Customs SIEV221 internal review. Both found that the emergency response of agencies on the island was excellent. This is in keeping with the committee's own inquiry, which did not come across anything that would lead the committee to question the quality of the response and rescue effort mounted.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The committee considers that this report complements the findings and recommendÂ­ations of the Customs review, as well as the work undertaken by the Christmas Island Emergency Management Committee. The Customs internal review made eight prompt, comprehensive and appropriate recommendÂ­ations. The committee bore these in mind over the course of the inquiry and noted that seven had already been implemented by the time the committee reported. Their impleÂ­mentation will go a long way towards filling any gaps in Australia's rescue response endeavours identified in retrospect and will streamline any future rescue efforts, should they ever be required.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This tragedy has demonstrated the inherent dangers of the people-smuggling business in an horrific way and at great human cost. The committee hopes that this inquiry and report have helped elucidate how difficult a position rescue crew and witnesses to the tragedy found themselves in, and it praises the courage of everyone involved in the rescue effort under such impossible conditions.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">On behalf of the committee I once again thank everyone who provided evidence for this inquiry. This participation process was painful for many. The committee recognises and appreciates their efforts. I would also like to pay significant tribute to the secretariat staff, who also had to engage with the committee members in hearing evidence from many of the groups affected. They also viewed the Christmas Island tragedy site and witnessed footage of the tragedy itself. I would also like to pay tribute to my fellow committee members particularly the deputy chair, Mr Keenan, from the other place, Mrs Markus from the other place, Mr Perrett, Mr Husic and Mr Champion, and Senator Cash, Senator Fielding and Senator Crossin. I thank them all very much for their cooperation and efforts involved in getting a unanimous report. I think it is a very thorough and comprehensive report, a very sensitive and difficult report to bring to conclusion, but I think that we all shared some of the pain involved. I can only again simply recognise the enormous courage that was displayed by everyone involved in the rescue effort. It could easily have turned out very badly for the rescuers themselves. We note that they operated in conditions far, far, far above the operational capacities of the vessels they were using, and their courage has made Australia proud. The rest of the islanders who were also involved in the rescue effort have also made us particularly proud to be Australians, and I commend everybody involved.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I rise to speak on the report of the Senate Select Committee on the Reform of the Australian Federation. On behalf of the committee I am pleased to speak to the committee's report entitled <span style="font-style:italic;">Australia's Federation: an agenda for reform</span>. The report was presented to the President of the Senate on 30 June 2011. In establishing the inquiry, the Senate was seeking an assessment of whether the federal system is effectively serving the needs of the Australian people. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The committee heard considerable evidence that federalism allows a geographÂ­ically large and diverse country such as Australia to maintain national unity and deal with global issues at the same time as respecting regional difference, and that the most internationally competitive economics in the world are federations. Evidence presented to the committee underlined that the federal model of governance we see operating in today's Australia still delivers on the principle that promoted the formation of the Australian nation, namely, that through union more can be achieved than the states could achieve separately. As a delegate at the 1898 Australasian Federation Conference commented:</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">No man can say that, even burdened with disunion, Australia will not have ... prosperity. No man can say that every state ... will not share it. But ... all that prosperity will be as nothing to the prosperity that will come from union. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The evidence before the committee was clear that Australia benefits socially, culturally and economically from this union. The nation has a robust system of government that continues to serve the Australian people well. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">However, the committee also heard of challenges facing the Federation. These include: vertical fiscal imbalance and centralising trends that impact the distribution of power between the levels of government and therefore the roles and responsibilities of the Commonwealth and the states. Cooperation and competition between jurisdictions can be of immeasurÂ­able benefit to Australians as standards are lifted across jurisdictions and resources are put to their best use. However, a key challenge facing Australia's model of federalism is to guarantee an appropriate balance between Commonwealth and state power. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The federal system also faces the challenge of remaining responsive to the needs of the Australian people. The AustraÂ­lian Federation should be dynamic and open to carefully considered reform. Change through constitutional referendums has been modest. Only eight out of 44 referendums have been passed. Whether this is an indication of Australia having a poor record of referendums or, as one witness suggested, a record of poor referendums, was debated keenly during the course of the inquiry. What is clear, though, is that there needs to be a significant and more effective engageÂ­ment with the Australian public than has hitherto occurred if reform is to be achieved. A willingness to reform will ensure that we can continue to meet the challenges facing the Federation and Australians can continue to enjoy the benefits of federalism as the nation evolves.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The committee considers the maintenance of the federal compact between the Commonwealth and the states requires a more coordinated program of review. We must move beyond the ad hoc approach to federal reform to develop a continuing process by which the health of the Australian Federation is continually monitored and improved. In accordance with the terms of reference received from the Senate, the committee's report sets out an agenda for considered reform of the Australian Federation. Among the measures recomÂ­mended are: the establishment of a joint parliamentary committee that will have an integral role in helping manage Australia's modern Federation; exploration of ways to place Commonwealth funding of local government on a more reliable long-term foundation; improvements to the operation of the Council of Australian Governments, otherwise known as COAG; and measures to improve public understanding of, and engagement with, the federal system including dedicated research into priorities affecting the Australian Federation. In all, the committee made 21 recommendations and I commend these to the Senate. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The report brings to a close an inquiry conducted over 12 months for which four hearings were held and 48 submissions received. The inquiry attracted extensive interest from persons across the Australian community including academics, lobby groups, individuals and government bodies at the Commonwealth, state, regional and local levels. This was an inquiry that touched on each level of government across each jurisdiction. The committee extends its thanks to all those who participated and thereby contributed to establishing an agenda for national reform.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">In concluding, the committee wishes to acknowledge the work of Senator Trood, chair of the committee, and I speak on behalf of the committee in the absence of Senator Trood, who retired on 30 June. The committee is grateful to the Senate for his leadership and his fervent commitment to the inquiry. The agenda for reform and the continuing action that the committee hopes will follow are part of Senator Trood's legacy and demonstrate his commitment to good governance within the Australian federal system. Additionally, we wish to place on record the extensive assistance of the secretariat and thank them for their excellent work that contributed to finalising this report.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The Community Affairs References Committee report <span style="font-style:italic;">Hear us: </span><span style="font-style:italic;">i</span><span style="font-style:italic;">nquiry into hearing health in Australia</span> was conducted mainly over the year 2009-10. It brought up a number of very important issues regarding hearing and disadvantaged people, including Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islanders. I want to address a couple of the issues that are related to our report. The first is the number of people, Aboriginal and non-Aboriginal, who have a significant intellectual disability or cognitive impairment and are currently racketing around within our prison system. These are often people who have served their term but cannot be released because there is nowhere to release them to.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">For instance, in the Northern Territory there has been a plan for some considerable time to build a type of halfway house support accommodation for people with intellectual disability leaving the prison system. The initial idea was to have it in Darwin. This was opposed and not approved. It seemed to be moved further and further and further out, until it is now right next door to the prison and within the prison's fence. This is to be a shared halfway house for people with mental health problems and people with intellectual disability. I do not see this as the beginning of any sort of solution for people who often, because of their inability to communicate, are not afforded the same sort of justice as others.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">One of the big issues that was raised during the hearing health inquiry was that people are often seen as behaving badly, being uncooperative or having low IQ when in fact it is their lack of hearing that is causing the issue, not their other abilities. We really need to look at the system that we are currently using to assist people who are in the prison system often through no fault of their own, but more a fault of the system and the fact that they are not supported. People have been imprisoned for relatively minor crimes. If the only response once they have served their sentence is for them to go back into the community without any support or any help, the odds that they will commit the same crime all over again are quite high.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Some horrific stories are told by people who have worked in the guardianship area in Queensland, the Northern Territory and Victoria about people who were abused as children, who clearly have hearing and other difficulties, including intellectual disability or cognitive impairment, and who are being treated over and over again as perpetrators when in fact they are victims. There are horrific stories of their childhoods and, when they get out of prison, they are often living rough, drinking too much and offering themselves for sex as a way to fund their drinking or their drugs, yet our system has no way of helping these people.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">In Queensland we have a Mental Health Court and a Murri Court designed to help people with specific needs through the court system. We do not have anything similar for people with cognitive impairment, and yet many people with hearing and other problems do not fit into those Mental Health or Murri courts. In my view we need nationally to address the issue of finding ways to support people who are in the prison system when there are probably a lot better places for them to be where they could be supported and given a chance to have a real life. To continue to punish people for what is often not their fault in the first place I find completely offensive.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The other issue I would like to raise with regard to the hearing health inquiry is perhaps the flipside of this. Hearing is part of being able to communicate and so is speech. Currently in Australia we have an extreme shortage of speech pathologists. We do not have any sort of national plan for how to go about developing more speech pathologists. We do not have any sort of national plan for how we go about retaining speech pathÂ­ologists within the system. Despite the training that is needed to become a speech pathologist it is often an underpaid occuÂ­pationâand guess what? It is a female dominated occupation, so why would we be surprised that it is not as well paid as some of the other professions that require the same level of training as is required to become a speech pathologist. We need to wrap all of this up in one bundle and look at the issues that have developed. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I was delighted with the hearing health inquiry and I have been pleased by some of the government responses to it. But I suggest that we use this as a launching pad to inquire further into the way we treat prisoners with disability of any sort and the way we treat Australians with communication difficulties, particularly, as I said, in the area of providing real speech pathology to people who need to develop their communication skills.</span>

              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">

              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I find it quite fascinating that the Australian National Audit Office has been audited. This happens on a regular basis, but I think it is worthwhile reviewing the review of the reviewer, if I might put it that way. The audit was conducted by a gentleman called Mr Geoff Wilson, who is the CEO of KPMG and is described here as the Independent Auditor. From my own experience of the ANAOâand, I imagine, that of many others hereâit is not surprising to find that the summary conclusion is:</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Small">The ANAOâs planning and scoping of the annual performance audit program and individual performance audits is being undertaken in an efficient and effective manner.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The Independent Auditor has not produced any formal recommendations but has come up with four suggestions about ways the ANAO might improve their work. These included the way the ANAO go about individual audit planning and scopingâlooking at the framework that they put around these. The Independent Auditor has suggested 'formalising the existing checkÂ­point for the review of the audit work plan.' An audit work plan is developed by a working group within the ANAO once they have decided to proceed with an audit. The Independent Auditor also looked at how the ANAO should improve the documentation of internal consultation within the IT Audit branch and suggested there should be 'further support and training in the professional services automation system.'</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I was pleased to find, in looking at this reportâand I must admit it is the first year that I have looked at this reportâthat Australia and Canada are amongst some of the few international audit organisations that do use international auditing standards in undertaking their performance audit activities. The Internal Auditor has produced a table giving a high-level comparison of the ANAO and the Canadian Office of the Auditor-General. The review makes the point that there are some differences between what the two groups do. For instance, the Australian National Audit Office uses a rolling work programâevery 12 months suggestions are sought on what should go into what is called the blue book, which is where the ANAO keep their plan of proposed performance audits. It is a rolling thing. Canada has a different planning system where the work is primarily generÂ­ated out of the Office of the Auditor General itself and they come up with a five-year plan.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The comparison made by the Independent Auditor found that the ANAO produces between 45 and 55 performance audits and currently produces the following audit products: financial statement audit opinions, regulatory assurance reports, better practice guides and the Defence Materiel OrganisaÂ­tion major projects report. That compares with the Canadian OAG, which produces between 26 and 33 performance audits and undertakes financial audits, special examinaÂ­tions, sustainable developÂ­ment monitoring activitiesâan interesting one, I thought, for an auditing organisation which has come primarily out of a financial and regulatory systemâenvironmental petitions and assessÂ­ment of agency performance reports. There was close alignment between the two organisations in some areas. I suggest that we have a fantastic system right now and that the way the ANAO relates to all parliamentary committeesâprimarily to the Joint Committee on Public Accounts and Auditâis a very strong and robust part of our system. I am concerned sometimes by the limits that appear to be placed on the ANAO in terms of the way they go about their audits. They often look at the way legislation, a department or someone else has performed according to the standards that were set. They do not go outside that framework. One example I can think of off the top of my head was in relation to whether government advertising meets the guidelines established by the government. Whilst it was all very well to say, 'This is the criteria established by the government for governÂ­ment advertising and they meet that criteria,' there was no criticism of the criteria per se. I would suggest that without assessing the semiotics around an advertisementâwho was in it, whether the Australian flag was in it or whateverâit is very hard to say that an advertisement is not trying to influence people towards a particular party point of view if you do not do a semiotic analysis of an advertisement.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Of course that was outside what the ANAO was allowed to do in that situation. I am delighted that this report exists and I am delighted that Mr Wilson has so carefully analysed the overall performance of the ANAO in regard to how it develops the projects that are in the blue book, how it scopes out what it will do and also in regard to the individual audits that the ANAO undertakes. I have also been pleased by the response of the ANAO to the suggestions of the independent auditor. There is one I could read out here but it has about 12 abbreviations involving things like PASGs, AASGs and AWPs. Primarily, what it is trying to say is that the ANAO should build a few more steps into the work plans that they develop for undertaking specific audits so that there is a visibility of who is doing what between the executive that do the consultation, the public audit group and individual audit group. I am trying to look up an abbreviation as I speak. It is suggested that the performance audit services group who would oversight the development of each individual audit and the assurance audit services group, the AASG, who oversight how well each audit is undertaken need to consult more visibly. I am pleased to see that that idea of making sure that there is a complete knowledge transfer from the group that decided how to do it to the group that oversights how well the audit was achieved is a recommendation that the ANAO has accepted and will be implementing.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">As I said, I think the ANAO does an extremely good job and I am pleased that we have the ability to oversight how it has done. Perhaps one small omission in my view from this report is that there is no indication of how the independent auditor is chosen and to whom the independent auditor reports.

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">
                  <a href="I0P" type="MemberSpeech">
                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Senator FURNER</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-State">Queensland</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">18:43</span>):  I rise this evening to talk about one of the government's great initiatives, the Building the Education Revolution program. I have spoken many times in this place on this fantastic program, which saw 9,500 schools across Australia receive the new facilities that they yearned for but never could afford. When the world was facing the global financial crisis in 2009 the government knew it had to take immediate action so that Australians would not face the same fate as many in the United States who lost their jobs.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We took swift action and implemented our $42 billion Nation Building and Jobs Plan to stimulate the economy and keep working Australians in jobs. We put thought into projects which have lasting benefits for communities across the nation through boosting local infrastructure and supporting jobs. We injected more than $14 million into 10,521 new 21st century facilities for primary schools, $822 million into 537 science or language projects, $1,289 million into 12,680 school maintenance and refurbishments projects, $5,238 million into 19,300 new social housing dwellings, $246 million into 829 new Defence Housing dwellings, $400 million into repairs for 75,000 social dwellings, $150 million into about 600 black spot road projects, $150 million into 300 new boom gates at high-risk crossings, $800 million into 3,351 community infrastructure projects, $711 million into advancing the allocation of funds for 14 major road projects, $1,189 million into 17 rail infrastructure projects and $1,688 million into strengthening facilities for training and higher education.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">One of the key aspects of the stimulus package was the $16.2 billion BER program. Our plan was to invest in the education, skills and training of our young people to boost the productivity and prosperity of our nation for future generations As of 31 January there had been 23,711 projects approved under the program, with 19,975 projects completed. I have been to many BER openings in the past 18 monthsâtoo many to countâand there will be another 40 coming up before the end of the year. I have heard nothing but praise for this fantastic Labor government initiative.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">This much-longed-for funding enabled schools to build halls and libraries when in the past they did not even have access to these facilities. For some schools, it was the first time they had a multipurpose hall, and the very first time they were able to fit the whole school into one area. For some, it was the first time they had an actual library and no longer had to share a classroom with a room full of books. I have seen new kitchens to complement participation in the Stephanie Alexander Garden Kitchen Program, another fantastic government initiative. I have seen new music rooms and dance studios. For some schools, this is the biggest thing to happen in years. I have seen new stages for performing arts projects and covered play areas and new playground equipment.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">All of these are projects that the schools never would have been able to build without this type of funding. And how do I know this? They have told me. Every single opening I have been to in Queensland has been a joyous occasion for the schoolâa celebrationâand a far cry from the 'monumental failure' the member for Sturt, Christopher Pyne, has described.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Principals and P&amp;C presidents have talked of the benefits these new facilities bring to their schools. Unlike the 'glorified garden sheds' that Senator Boyce has described the BER projects as, we have 21st century facilities which will allow our nation's students to use new technology in their everyday learning. Most classrooms that I have seen have interactive whiteboards, a far cry from the blackboard and chalk and the whiteboards of my generation. I have even seen green rooms attached to new libraries where students can film themselves doing presentations and then edit them in the facilities.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">To some principals, these new facilities are a dream come true. Some have been teaching for more than 30 years and never imagined that they would see new buildings like these in their schools. On many occasions I have been asked to send my regards and thanks to the Prime Minister, Senator Evans and the government for providing these new halls, libraries, classÂ­rooms and science and language centres. Judith Seery, the principal of St Anthony's Primary School at Alexandra Hills, said:</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">

                  <span style="&#xD;&#xA;    font-size:9.5pt;&#xD;&#xA;  ">We are indeed grateful to the federal government for their generous gift to St Anthony's. It's an extraordinary privilege. Senator Mark Furner, </span>
                  <span style="&#xD;&#xA;    font-size:9.5pt;&#xD;&#xA;  ">please pass on to Prime Minister Julia Gillard and the federal government our sincere thanks as a result this funding has assisted local trades people, families and communities to participate in activities to support achievement to develop learning potential â¦</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">Belinda Leavers, the principal of Loganlea State High School, said:</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">Steve Ariel, the president of Carbrook State School P&amp;C, said: </span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">

                  <span style="&#xD;&#xA;    font-size:9.5pt;&#xD;&#xA;  ">For some of you, having these fantastic new facilities will impact your lives in ways you cannot begin to imagine. They will make huge differences to your future. So on behalf of your mums, dads, guardians and the Carbrook community, I am here to say thank you. Thank you for giving us these great buildings, this fantastic gift. Thank you for investing in our children and the future of Carbrook.</span>
                </span>
              </p>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">Roz Cooper, the council chairperson at Living Faith Lutheran Primary School, said:</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">
                  <span style="&#xD;&#xA;    font-size:9.5pt;&#xD;&#xA;  " />
                  <span style="&#xD;&#xA;    font-size:9.5pt;&#xD;&#xA;  ">We are just absolutely delighted because we couldn't have got as high quality or well appointment in the buildings without the funding of the state and federal governments for both this hall and our third year one class. Given that this is our 10th year, that would have been well down the track before we could achieve that, so we're very very grateful.</span>
                </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Lastly, I thank the students from the Canungra State School. They were so grateful, they provided me with beautifully coloured posters and cards from their BER openingâand these now fill my office. To celebrate the opening, every class came up onto the stage and presented their hard work to me, which they had spent a long time in developing, </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The BER initiative has benefited not only our teachers and students but also the wider community. All of these new facilities are or will be available to community groups to access. Already some schools allow taekwondo clubs and dance schools to use their new halls. While the government has heard nothing but positives about the BER program, the opposition criticised this key investment in education.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">In conclusion, the Labor government's BER program has been an absolute success. Not only have we provided 21st century facilities to our students; we have given schools the boost, the encouragement and the tools to prosper. I have seen the members for Longman, Forde, Moncrieff, Wright, Ryan and Hinkler at some of the BER openings, which shows me that they support the BER initiative. I look forward to seeing them at more openings in the coming months.</span>
