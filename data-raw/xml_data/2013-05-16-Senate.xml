              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">This matter arises to allow for the Senate to consider the very important issues around asylum seekers getting on boats and coming to the mainland. A further incident this week has highlighted the ongoing concerns around our inability to implement the full recommendations of the Houston report. Senators will be aware that government business order of the day No. 2, Migration Amendment (Unauthorised Maritime Arrivals and Other Measures) Bill 2012 has been on the <span style="font-style:italic;">Notice Paper</span> this week and, with cooperation from the opposition, the urgency of this matter has been accepted today so that we deal with this matter this morning rather than the private senators' business legislation and the reinstatement of temporary protection visas, for which there is no agreement. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">On that basis I highlight that we need to deal with the issues around people smugglers, who continue to evolve their tactics and will use any trick in the book to try and evade authorities. Border Protection Command uses an intelligence-led approach to the deployment of their aerial and surveillance assets in order to ensure the most rapid deployment in response to distress calls or to intercept suspected irregular entry vessels. However, as we have seen in recent times, three of such ships arrived directly onto our borders. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Whatever you think of this wretchedly difficult policy area, the government of the day should be given the power it thinks it needs to stop the boats. That is what has been denied previously in this debate. I am pleased that today we are able to progress this particular recommendation of the Houston report. We need to implement all of the recommendations of the Houston expert panel, including the Malaysian solution, but we welcome the opportunity to deal with this one today.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Tasmania</span>—<span class="HPS-MinisterialTitles">Leader of the Australian Greens</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">09:34</span>):  What an absolute disgrace it is that we have now got the coalition and government working together to engage in what has been previously described by the Labor Party as a stain on our national character. You are right: it is a stain on our national character. As Mr Bowen said in 2006, it is a bad bill with no redeeming features—a bad bill with no redeeming features for which you are seeking to suspend standing orders and to bring on here in a rush, with the support of the coalition. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I am not surprised that the coalition support it, because it is their bill. It is what former Prime Minister John Howard tried to bring into this parliament. The nation was horrified at the prospect that a prime minister would seek to wipe Australia off the map in order to avoid our global obligations under the refugee convention. It is an affront to the decency of the whole Australian nation. I am shocked that the Labor Party have now abandoned any sense of decency. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The Prime Minister was out this week trying to sell a budget which she says will deliver a fairer Australia—great!—a fairer Australia in which we wipe the entire country off the map when it comes to decency and human rights and which imposes what the Labor Party itself has described as a stain on the national character. This policy takes away the legal rights of asylum seekers. They will no longer be recognised if they land on Australian mainland territory. That is what this is about. It is not about looking at why people are seeking asylum in the first place, what is driving people to leave their countries. It is a failure to recognise that deterrence does not and has not worked. In fact, three or four times more people have arrived here seeking asylum since you brought in crueller and crueller policies—policies lacking in compassion.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I see that several members of the Labor Party who go around the country to forums and refugee conventions, who hold positions in United Nations organisations, saying, 'I don't agree with it,' are not here. Where are you today, Senator Singh? Where are you today? Where are all of these people in the Labor Party who stand up around the country saying they uphold the United Nations conventions? Where are you? Today Labor are standing with the coalition, delivering what John Howard could not. But in 2006 you did not think it was fair, and it was not; you did not think it was legal, and it was not; you did not think it was decent in terms of international law, and indeed it was not. This demonstrates once and for all why people are so disappointed that a government that says it wants to deliver a fair Australia is doing nothing of the sort. It is not only delivering an unfair Australia; it is delivering an Australia which is increasingly, in the international context, becoming a disgrace.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">Here we are, elected to the United Nations Security Council. What does the rest of the world think of us now that we are going to excise our entire nation from the map so that we can be crueller to refugees, crueller to people seeking asylum? It is a stain on our national character.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The motion for the suspension of standing orders because of urgency implies that it is more urgent than normal to do what is an affront to international law, an affront to decency in this country. You want it to be more urgent than it otherwise would be, because the urgency is that you want to be crueller, Senator Collins—I am glad you think this is amusing—</span>

                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">

                    <a href="I0M" type="MemberSpeech">
                      <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Senator CASH</span>
                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Western Australia</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">09:50</span>):  I indicate to the chamber that the coalition will not be opposing the Migration Amendment (Unauthorised Maritime Arrivals and Other Measures) Bill 2012. The reason we will not be opposing the bill is that the substance of it is consistent with the coalition's long-held position in relation to the offshore processing regime and, in any event, it is fundamentally the same bill as the one that was introduced by the Howard government in 2006 and, which I note, was passed by the House of Representatives.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The stated objective of the bill is to expand the existing offshore processing regime to apply to all persons arriving on mainland Australia unlawfully by sea. It will replace the concept of 'offshore entry person' with the concept of 'unauthorised maritime arrival'. The effect of the bill is that persons who arrive on Australian soil by boat without a valid visa will be subject to removal to an offshore processing country and will be processed according to that regime—that is, the bill will effectively excise the Australian mainland from the Migration Act. It is intended to be a disincentive aimed at discouraging potential unlawful immigrants from making the hazardous sea voyage to Australia.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">While the coalition will not be opposing, and in fact is strongly supporting, the passage of this legislation today—and I note for the record that the coalition voted with the government to rearrange the business of the Senate today to ensure that this bill was given precedence and that the coalition gave up our private senators' time this morning to ensure that this bill is facilitated in a timely fashion—I do believe we need to consider why the government has introduced this bill, given that when the same bill was introduced in 2006 by the Howard government those on the opposite side of the chamber howled in opposition to it. These are the facts that Australia is faced with today.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Five years ago in November 2007, when this Labor government was first elected to office, there were just four people in immigration detention who had arrived in Australia illegally by boat. When the Labor government was elected to office in November 2007, maintenance of Australia's immigration detention network was costing Australian taxpayers less than $100 million per annum. In fact, it was costing approximately $85 million. Today there are well in excess of 15,000 illegal maritime arrivals in Australia's detention system, whether they are on bridging visas in community detention, in alternative places of detention or in the detention network itself. This government's spectacular record of failure in relation to this portfolio worsens when you consider that the number of people who have arrived since November 2007 is 40,772 on 673 boats. It is a fact, and that is one of the reasons whereby the government and Minister O'Connor today came to the coalition quite literally on bended knee and begged us to facilitate the passage of this legislation, which we agreed we would do. It is a fact that Australia is now witnessing what is an unprecedented rate of boat arrivals and that is, without a doubt, the sole reason the government has done an about-face in relation to policy in this area.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">April 2013 is now on record as the month with the largest number of asylum seeker arrivals, with 3,300 people arriving by boat in that one month alone. March 2013 saw over 2,500 asylum seekers arrive and even though we are only two weeks into May, we have already seen 1,500 asylum seekers arrive. What that means—and perhaps the reason the government again came to the coalition on bended knee today, with Minister O'Connor begging shadow minister Scott Morrison for his assistance in relation to the facilitation of this legislation through the Senate—is that Australia has witnessed approximately 66 people arriving by boat per day this year. That is solely attributable to this government's grotesque failure in relation to border protection policy. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This bill was introduced into the parliament by the former Minister for Immigration and Citizenship, Mr Bowen, on 31 October 2012. The proposal set out in the bill reflects some but not all of the advice of the Expert Panel on Asylum Seekers, which recommended that an arrival anywhere in Australia by regular maritime means should result in such individuals having the same status as those arriving at an offshore place which has already been excised from the immigration zone. The effect of this bill will mean that irregular maritime arrivals anywhere in Australia will make that person liable to regional processing arrangements.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Given the hysteria of the government in 2006 when we introduced what is effectively the same piece of legislation—which I believe the government now acknowledges, given they have today come cap in hand to the coalition, is part of a suite of policy measures which indeed does stop the boats—I believe it is appropriate to put on the record comments of those at the time and what the Labor members said in relation to the Howard government's legislation and to note that today they are the ones who are begging us, the coalition who stopped the boats, to now support them in their efforts to restore part of the former Howard government's strong suite of border protection policies, which clearly, by the passage of this legislation, they now admit they were wrong in rolling back. Take, for example, the comments of the former minister for immigration, the minister who in the other place introduced what is effectively the former Howard government's bill. This is what he said back in 2006: </span>

                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">This is a bad bill with no redeeming features. It is a hypocritical and illogical bill. If it is passed today, it will be a stain on our national character ... If it is passed, it will be repealed by an incoming Labor government.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">History now records that it was, in fact, repealed by the incoming Labor government. History also now records the facts I have outlined for the record today—that Australia has now been subjected to an unprecedented number of illegal boat arrivals. Under this government, we are heading towards 41,000 arrivals in 2013, which equates to approximately 66 arrivals per day. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Despite the fact that Minister Bowen in 2006 took a completely different stance on legislation which had been proven to work and to stop the boats, we see that same minister, now in government, acknowledging that Labor have made one of the greatest—if not the greatest—policy mistakes of all time. They are now backing the coalition to side with them and support what is effectively Howard government legislation.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Small">It has been a test of the Australian Labor Party and we have risen to the occasion, and that is why we are rejecting this legislation.</span>

                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Clearly Mr Albanese has also come to the realisation, as have the majority of Australians, that Labor were wrong in 2006 and that they were wrong in 2008 when they repealed the Howard government legislation. But they are right today to come into this place and to ask the coalition to assist them in facilitating the passage of what is effectively the former Howard government's legislation.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Why has the Labor Party done an about-face? Why did the Labor Party—the current minister, Mr O'Connor— come to the shadow minister, Mr Morrison, and effectively beg him to assist Labor in passing this legislation today? These are the reasons. Over the life of the Howard government, 1999 was the year of the greatest number of boat arrivals—86 boats arrived in 1999. In comparison, this year 86 boats arrived just between 1 January and 14 April. The greatest number of asylum seekers arriving in any one year under the Howard government was in 2001—5,550 people arrived in 2001. In comparison, the Gillard government managed to exceed that figure in just the eight weeks covering March and April of this year. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">What did we, the former Howard government, do? We realised we had a problem and we took strong and decisive action, which included the action set out in the bill before the Senate today. What was the result of the former Howard government's strong border protection policies? In 2002, the year after the Pacific solution was introduced, the number of boats arriving in Australia was reduced to zero. In 2003, one boat arrived; in 2004, zero boats arrived; in 2005, four boats arrived; in 2006, six boats arrived; and, in 2007, five boats arrived. The fact of the matter is this: the Labor Party cannot deny that, when they assumed office in November 2007, they inherited a solution from the former Howard government. In August of 2008, they proceeded quite deliberately and arrogantly to wind back the proven border protection policies of the former Howard government. We have now come almost full circle and we stand here today in the Senate implementing—or re-implementing—a further plank of the former Howard government's border protection policies. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Will this go far enough? Absolutely not. I have put forward a private senator's bill to reintroduce temporary protection visas. That is something which this bill does not do. I would say to those on the other side: if you really are fair dinkum about stopping the boats and if you really do want to return, as you are telling us, to the former Howard government's policies, you must also give urgent consideration to restoring temporary protection visas as part of the suite of policy measures.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">There is a difference between the Howard government bill and this bill. One of those differences is—lo and behold—their effectiveness. The government's March 2012 decision to allow all offshore entry persons access to merits and judicial review through the RRT and the courts severely weakens the effectiveness of this bill and will prove to be very costly to taxpayers—bearing in mind that the cost to taxpayers of the government's failed border protection policies is now in excess of $10 billion. When the coalition introduced its bill in 2006, the bill's impact would have been much more significant than that of the current bill and would have denied all asylum seekers access to merits and judicial review. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Whilst the Labor government have significantly watered down a number of previous coalition initiatives, consequently diminishing the potential impact of this bill, the broad principle of this bill is, as I said at the outset, consistent with coalition policy and we will therefore support it—notwithstanding the gross hypocrisy of Labor. In 2006, Labor were screaming from the rooftops that the very provisions which they have begged us to support today—the very provisions which, under the Howard government, were proven to work—were anathema to them. I commend this bill to the Senate.</span>

When John Howard, back in 2006, proposed to do this very thing here in this place, not only did we have members of the Labor Party speaking strongly against it; we even had members of the coalition speaking strongly against it. When John Howard proposed to strip all migration law rights away from people based on their arriving on the Australian mainland, one of the reasons that that bill did not end up passing the Senate was that even Barnaby Joyce—</span>

                    </a>  believed that this was bad policy. Even Senator Barnaby Joyce knew the madness of this policy. It must be pretty bad when you have got Senator Joyce arguing for the rights of refugees and the rights of vulnerable people under basic rule-of-law provisions.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I urge all members in this place to search the back of their conscience and to think about why this is really being put forward and why there is an urgency for it to be rushed through. There is no urgency, of course, except the continued failure of the government's already harsh, inhumane and cruel no advantage rule and offshore processing, which have not worked to stem the flow of people in our region who are desperate to seek protection. The Prime Minister on this issue is always looking for somebody else to blame, and now it is that we have provisions on the mainland that uphold the rule of law—that is bad and that has got to go, according to the Prime Minister and this Labor government. And of course Tony Abbott's opposition are going to support this legislation, because it is their policy. This is the Labor government implementing John Howard's policy and Tony Abbott's policy. That is what is going on here. We do not have to wait until 14 September; we have already got the opposition's policy. The Labor government have done all the Liberal Party's dirty work when it comes to beating up on refugees, dog whistling on immigration and stripping away laws that protect the most vulnerable in our community.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This bill effectively excises the entire mainland of Australia from the ordinary operations of the migration zone so that, wherever somebody may arrive, they do not have the right to seek protection under normal circumstances. This expands the already existing two-tiered system that is in direct contravention of the refugee convention, which clearly identifies that we should not be discriminating against people and their right to protection, care and safety based on their mode of arrival. It is simply wrong. It is unacceptable under the refugee convention. Yet here we are this morning seeing exactly that happening—both the government and the opposition doing away with, violating, the letter and the spirit of the rights outlined in the refugee convention.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">As I said, the Howard government had already attempted to do this. In 2001, they set up a system which treated refugees who arrived by boat differently—not to protect them, not to care for them, not to deal in a practical way with their vulnerability and needs. No, no; it was to demonise them, to whip up fear and hatred and to send a signal to the nastiest, darkest parts of our psyche, where we may think that somehow, because somebody is a refugee and had to come by boat, they are a bad person. That is precisely why John Howard changed these rules in 2001 and that is precisely what the Labor government, hand in hand and shoulder to shoulder with Tony Abbott's coalition, are doing today.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This is yet another stark and very, very disappointing example of the government locked in a race to the bottom with the coalition over immigration and refugee policy. Punishing refugees for seeking protection in Australia is the central concept of this bill. Let us not beat around the bush. This bill does nothing to save people's lives. This bill does nothing to protect and help and care for vulnerable refugees, including children. This bill does nothing to help these people and it will not save their lives. This bill is all about punishment and all about whipping up fear and hatred and demonising people because of how they arrived and where they have come from. The fact is that the majority of people who arrive here by boat—whether it is in the already excised zone or the small handful of people who find their way to the mainland—are people who could not come to Australia by plane because they never would have got a ticket without a visa, because of the countries that they come from, because of their need to flee from torture, from persecution, from war. This bill goes right to the heart of discriminating against refugees because of the places they have had to flee.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Of course, as we know, just as happened in 2006, this bill has been widely criticised by a range of legal and human rights experts. This bill went to inquiry, and it was universally condemned. The only supporting evidence to this inquiry came from the government's own department. Not one independent voice in support of this piece of legislation came forward. Not one independent voice of support exists for this legislation.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">In fact, let me just go to what the United Nations and their human rights and refugee committees have said in relation to this piece of legislation. We know that the UNHCR in Australia have said that they are extremely concerned that the measures to excise large portions of the territory to set up systems which substantially reduce fundamental refugee protection rights sets a negative precedent internationally.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This is not about building a regional protection framework; this is doing the absolute opposite. This is about gross, bottom of the barrel, crass domestic politics here in Australia. This is about the Labor Party competing with Tony Abbott as to who can be the toughest, the cruellest, the meanest on refugees.</span>

Before you continue, Senator Hanson-Young, Senator Williams is absolutely correct: you have, on a number of occasions, referred to other members of parliament without their correct titles.

                    </a>  Thank you, Mr Acting Deputy President. This is crass domestic politics that is based on the Labor Party competing, in a race to the bottom, as to who can be the cruellest, the nastiest, the meanest, the harshest on refugees. A race to the bottom with Mr Abbott's coalition—that is what this piece of legislation is about.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The UNHCR goes on to say that, if each one of the 148 other countries around the world that have signed on to the refugee convention took this attitude and changed their laws in this way, it would undermine the entire convention. This legislation is out of step with not just the letter but absolutely the spirit of the convention. We know that the Refugee Council has said that they are extremely concerned about this as well—that it violates our obligations. It strips away people's rights, and it will likely cause serious harm to people fleeing from persecution and torture. It will cause more harm, more damage, to people who are already fleeing some pretty unsafe and harmful circumstances. That is what the experts are saying.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We know that many of the church groups around the country are extremely concerned about this as well, from a moral perspective as well as a legal one. We have seen Elenie Poulos, the National Director of UnitingJustice, attached to the Uniting Church, say that this is a shameful piece of legislation that undercuts our moral responsibilities as a nation towards vulnerable and oppressed asylum seekers.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This is a bad piece of legislation and is only designed to hurt people and not care for them. There is nothing in this legislation that will save people's lives—in fact, unfortunately, all to the contrary. People's lives are going to be at more risk. People are going to suffer more. Children will not have rights. Despite the need for protection, they will not now have access to lawyers. They will not have any legal assistance at all. They cannot even make a claim for refugee protection under this legislation. They can be sent, of course, offshore to one of the cruel camps—whether that is Manus Island or Nauru or wherever else this government or the coalition decide they want to start dumping vulnerable refugees. This bill exposes vulnerable people to indefinite detention in inhumane and cruel camps.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">As to those who may be lucky enough to be put on a bridging visa after suffering in detention, they will have no work rights. They will have no access to proper education or medical services. They will have no way of being able to rebuild their lives and protect their children. In fact, children and families under this legislation will be pushed into poverty even further.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This legislation exposes more people in immigration detention to inadequate legal assistance and legal oversight—in fact, not just 'inadequate'; they have no rights at all. Whether you are the vulnerable family of someone who has been fighting for democracy in Iran or a Hazara family from Afghanistan, you have no rights for proper protection under this piece of legislation.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">What is the urgency for us to have to rush this piece of legislation through? It is not going to stop people coming here by boat; we know that. We know that being harsh to people, deterrence policies, do not stop people taking those dangerous journeys when that is the only option they have. We have seen that proven over the last six months.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Back in August last year, we saw this again—the Labor Party implementing the coalition's policies on offshore detention, on stripping out protection and on the no-advantage rule. We were told that was going to slow the boats. It has not slowed the boats at all: we have four times the number of people fleeing to Australia than we did last year. It has not stopped people taking those journeys. It has not saved people's lives.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">In fact, the unfortunate thing about all of this is that no-one is safer—no-one is being kept safer or treated better; no-one's rights are being upheld. In fact, the exact opposite is happening: we are now subjecting children to institutionalised child abuse in the detention camps of cruelty on Manus Island. That is the reality of the policies that are coming from this government, backed up by Mr Abbott's coalition. These policies are not saving people's lives; they are not caring for people. These policies and this legislation are subjecting people to further harm and torture.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I will be moving three amendments to this legislation. The first amendment is in relation to allowing for media access to these detention camps that Australians are paying billions and billions of dollars for. We saw the budget come out on Tuesday night and we know that offshore processing is costing Australian taxpayers more than $7½ billion. In fact, if you include this year and the forward estimates, it is costing $10 billion to detain children and their families on Manus Island, in inhumane conditions, damaging them for the rest of their lives—$10 billion. There is of course no media access to these detention centres, because the government do not want the Australian people to see how badly we are treating our fellow human beings. They do not want the Australian conscience to be pricked by the truth of what is going on in these camps. The amendment that I will be moving in relation to that is to allow media access to our detention centres, particularly those offshore on Manus Island and Nauru.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The second amendment is about allowing the Australian Human Rights Commission to enter those camps and be able to inspect them—because we cannot trust either this government or any government run by the coalition to treat vulnerable refugees and their families properly. We know that every time we actually get a glimpse into what is going on in these awful places, we see that people are not being treated right, that it is inhumane, that children are suffering. We should be allowing the Australian Human Rights Commission to go inside and inspect. I ask you, Mr Acting Deputy President: if there is nothing to hide, why not let them in?</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The third amendment is a very important one, in relation to removing children and their families from Manus Island. It is a horrible place. It is a cruel place. It is an inhumane place. Even adults should not be there. Vulnerable refugees do not deserve to be treated like animals, as we have seen from the footage that was leaked through the <span style="font-style:italic;">Four Corners</span><span style="font-style:italic;"></span>report only some weeks ago. Children are suffering on Manus Island, and it is time they were brought to the Australian mainland and cared for properly. This amendment will ban any government from being able to detain children, remove children to those awful places of abuse and cruelty—they are inhumane. Those children must be brought to the Australian mainland and cared for.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">As a mother I have a responsibility to stand in this place and argue for the rights of those children. I call on every senator in this place to stand up for those children's rights as well, and do what you would want if they were your children.</span>

                      <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Senator THISTLETHWAITE</span>
                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">New South Wales</span>—<span class="HPS-MinisterialTitles">Parliamentary Secretary for Pacific Island Affairs and Parliamentary Secretary for Multicultural Affairs</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">10:28</span>):  I thank all senators for their contributions to the second reading debate on the Migration Amendment (Unauthorised Maritime Arrivals and Other Measures) Bill 2012. Dealing with the issue of irregular maritime arrivals has probably been the most difficult public policy issue that our nation has dealt with in the last 25 years. I do not believe that anyone in this parliament believes that Australia should take an immoral or heartless approach to refugees. And certainly our history demonstrates and proves that this nation has been most welcoming of people coming from difficult circumstances, fleeing persecution, fleeing war and settling in Australia.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This government's commitment to supporting refugees coming to this country is highlighted by the fact that we have increased the humanitarian intake of refugees to 20,000—I believe the largest settlement program of any nation throughout the world. But what we cannot allow to continue to happen are events such as those that occurred on 15 December 2010, when 50 innocent women and children drowned in shocking circumstances before the eyes of this nation on the rocks at Christmas Island. We simply cannot allow, as a nation with a heart, those circumstances to occur again.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The Gillard government empanelled a team of experts, headed by Angus Houston, to develop a set of recommendations to try and take the politics out of this very difficult issue and to come up with a workable solution for the long term. That panel consulted and reported, and they came up with 22 recommendations. They made it very clear to the government and to the nation when they made those recommendations that they must be accepted as a whole, a full package—that you could not seek to pick out and implement elements of it. They made it clear that it needed to come as a full package for it to be effective.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This bill delivers on one of those recommendations. It delivers on the advice of the experts that the government consulted to attempt to take the politics out of this issue. That recommendation is recommendation No. 14. It says:</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">… arrival anywhere on Australia by irregular maritime means will not provide individuals with a different lawful status than those who arrive in an excised offshore place.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">That is, irregular arrival by sea anywhere in Australia should make the person liable to regional processing arrangements. That is necessary to ensure the no advantage principle is adhered to. The panel's reasoning in making this recommendation was the need to reduce any incentive for people to take even greater risks with their lives by seeking to reach the Australian mainland to avoid being subject to regional processing arrangements. The report states:</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">The Panel considers that all possible measures should be implemented to avoid creating an incentive for IMAs taking even greater risks with their lives by seeking to reach the Australian mainland. As a complement to facilities in Nauru and PNG, the Panel recommends the Government bring forward legislative amendments to the Migration Act 1958 so that arrival on the Australian mainland by irregular maritime means does not provide individuals with a different lawful status than those who enter at an excised offshore place, such as Christmas Island.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">That is making it very clear to the Prime Minister, to the executive and to the nation what they expected as an effective means for ensuring a deterrent to people-smuggling. The panel also emphasised—and the government has consistently reiterated—that this recommendation in the report is part of an integrated set of proposals. To be effective in discouraging asylum seekers from risking their lives, the incentives and disincentives the panel recommended must be pursued in a comprehensive, coordinated manner. This includes incentives to encourage greater use of regular migration pathways and international protection arrangements and disincentives to undertake irregular maritime voyages, including the application of a no advantage principle and regional processing arrangements. The legislative amendments proposed in this bill are part of that integrated approach.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The bill was referred to the Senate Legal and Constitutional Affairs Committee for inquiry and report. I thank the committee for their report, tabled on 25 February 2013. I thank those who provided submissions and of course those who appeared before the committee. The bill involves complex issues, and I commend the manner in which the committee has captured and reported these complexities. The report states:</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">… the committee supports the intent of the Bill, subject to one important amendment.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The committee recommended that the bill be amended to require the Minister for Immigration and Citizenship to report annually to both houses of parliament in respect of matters relating to unauthorised maritime arrivals, including arrangements for assessing their refugee claims as well as the arrangements relating to accommodation, health care and education. Additionally, the committee recommended that the minister report on the number of asylum claims by unauthorised maritime arrivals that are assessed and determined to be refugees during the 12-month period. The government amendment that will be moved in the committee stage reflects this recommendation and will require the Minister for Immigration and Citizenship to cause that to be laid before each house of the parliament within 15 sitting days of that House after the end of the financial year.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The government does not support the amendments that have been put forward by the Greens, as that would be contrary to the recommendations of the expert panel, which the government has accepted and is implementing. The bill marks an important further step in giving effect to the recommendations of the panel and will remove yet another incentive for asylum seekers to take greater risks with their lives to reach the Australian mainland. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">In respect of the claim that this is excising the Australian mainland, let me reiterate that this bill does not purport to excise the Australian mainland from the migration zone. The definition of the migration zone is not being amended in this bill. Instead, the bill defines individuals subject to regional processing based on their status as unauthorised maritime arrivals—that is, by arriving in Australia in the migration zone, by sea, without a visa in effect. This is in contrast to the current situation, where an individual is only subject to regional processing if they enter regional Australia in an excised offshore place such as Christmas Island.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">In summing up, this government is fully committed to delivering a proper and sustainable regional solution through the full implementation of the recommendations of the expert panel that was led by Angus Houston. No-one should doubt this government's commitment to implementing all 22 of the recommendations of the expert panel to break the people smugglers business model and help to stop people dying at sea. That is how responsible governments develop policy—listening to the advice of experts.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I thank all senators for their contributions to this debate and I commend the bill and the government amendments to the Senate.</span>

                      <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Senator HANSON-YOUNG</span>
                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">South Australia</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">10:45</span>):  The first amendment that the Australian Greens are moving this morning in relation to this bill is to allow for the Australian Human Rights Commission to visit, inspect and report on the conditions and what is going on in offshore detention centres that are run by Australia and paid by for Australian taxpayers. We know, at the moment, they are on Manus Island and Nauru. This is a very important amendment. We know that the Human Rights Commission has these rights in Australian mainland detention centres. They are able to go to detention centres, inspect what is going on, talk to people about their cases and talk to people about the conditions that they are experiencing in those places.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The importance of this amendment is that it allows for the same rights and obligations that the Human Rights Commissioner has already for Australian based detention centres and, indeed, on Christmas Island to be similar to those for detention centres that we have further offshore on Manus Island and Nauru. It would allow the Human Rights Commissioner to go in, inspect, look at the conditions of what these camps are like and deal with any complaints or issues that come out of that. It is really important because, as we know, these centres are costing Australian taxpayers billions of dollars. The legal rights of the refugees who are locked up there indefinitely have been taken away. There is currently no transparency at all on Manus Island and Nauru.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I previously wrote to the minister about this. I raised this with the department in Senate estimates. It is clear that, unless we change the Migration Act, which is what this amendment does, there is no ability for the Australian Human Rights Commission—Australia's peak human rights body—to inspect what is going on in these places. When you look at the reports that have come out and when you hear the stories of people who have said how they were treated in these god-awful places, then you know something is going on and we need a bit more transparency.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">For the Australian Human Rights Commission to be able to go in and inspect is a really important thing for us and this chamber to do. We think that it is okay for it to happen in Australian based centres and it is all okay for it to happen on Christmas Island; let us make sure it is there for the refugees who are sent offshore. Let us not forget that these people are there indefinitely, as the government has this open-ended 'no advantage' rule. The children, their families, and the young men and women who are detained in these places could be there for five, 10 or 15—who knows how many—years. To allow for some proper transparency would go a long way to making sure that Australian taxpayers and members of our community who are concerned about issues of human rights and how we treat our fellow human beings can have some assurance that there is somebody watching what is going on.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">It is an important amendment and I would ask for the government and the opposition to support it. If they are not going to support it, I would ask for the minister representing the Minister for Immigration and Citizenship in this chamber today to explain why the government does not want to see this type of basic transparency available to the Australian Human Rights Commission in these god-awful places.</span>

                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">South Australia</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">10:52</span>):  I must say that I am extremely disappointed that the government wishes to continue this secrecy in relation to how vulnerable refugees are being treated and the conditions they are being kept in on Manus Island and Nauru. The Australian people have a right to know what is going on there, who is really in charge and, above all else, what our $10 billion being spent in the government's offshore processing regime is actually going to. It is hard to understand why the government would not want to ensure in Australian law through the Migration Act that the Human Rights Commission have access to these camps unless they have something to hide. That is the reality. What else are the Australian people meant to think? </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This is disappointing to many members of the community after seeing how badly people can be treated and the conditions they can be kept in in these places. It is not just under this Pacific solution mark 2 regime; we know that the conditions were horrendous when the camps were being run by the former John Howard government. One of the reasons why the Australian detention system was opened to the Australian Human Rights Commission and, indeed, the Commonwealth Ombudsman was the scandal of Vivian Solon and Cornelia Rau. They are the very real examples of what happens to people when governments do not allow these places to have proper scrutiny and transparency. That is the reality. We have seen it. It has been proven. It has ruined people's lives.</span>

                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Now, despite all of the evidence in front of us, this government are prepared to make the same mistakes all over again. What are the Australian people meant to think? There is no other explanation than that the government are wanting to hide what is really going on. They do not want proper scrutiny. It is bad enough that they put gag clauses in their contracts with service providers, but not letting Australia's peak human rights body inspect what is a fundamental part of this government's immigration system is dishonest, irresponsible and, frankly, shameful. There is no other explanation than that the government are wishing to hide what is really going on.</span>

As the minister has said on previous occasions, the process of designating regional processing countries, which can be disallowed by the parliament, provided the opportunity for parliament to scrutinise the arrangements that we were putting in place. It included the requirement to place before both houses of parliament a range of documents relating to regional processing arrangements, such as why it is in the national interest, advice from the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees and arrangements in relation to the treatment of persons.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">There are now a range of other mechanisms in place to support the objectives of transparency. For example, access to regional processing centres has been granted to the UNHCR and other human rights organisations and observers and, indeed, Australian politicians, and there is regular public reporting in relation to regional processing arrangements, including through mechanisms such as Senate estimates hearings. Additionally, Australia is working closely with regional processing countries to establish advisory arrangements as specified in the memoranda of understanding. An interim joint advisory committee has been established for Nauru, and we continue to work closely with PNG to develop similar arrangements. The government sees the oversight mechanisms as important in ensuring transparency of operations and policy.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I note that part of the committee's recommendations included reporting on health, education and accommodation arrangements in centres. In addition to a range of oversight arrangements in place, there are also a number of established quality assurance and reporting mechanisms for health, education and accommodation. These include treating transferees with dignity, respect and integrity, building an environment that supports security and safety, improving health and wellbeing outcomes for transferees, interacting with transferees in a culturally sensitive way, reflecting human rights principles through the provision of services and facilities, and ensuring the best interests of the child are taken into account.</span>

                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">South Australia</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">10:58</span>):  Wow! I realise the minister representing the immigration minister today is not the minister who was in the Senate on the night that we debated the legislation that would allow for refugees to be dumped on Manus Island or Nauru, but there is nothing binding in law to ensure that that entire list of things that the minister has just read out have to happen. In fact, there is nothing in law to ensure that they have to happen. The government and the opposition made it law that the minister does not have to prove any of this in the first instance. This chamber was not given the ability nor the right to scrutinise the conditions on Manus Island or Nauru deliberately by the government, because they knew it would not pass the test that even the Houston panel suggested was needed. The Houston report outlines a list of things that need to happen—how people have to be treated, the conditions that they will be kept in, the appropriateness of services, the appropriateness of accommodation. The Houston report said that no-one could be sent to these offshore places without these things in place. The point is precisely that none of those things is happening and there is no-one to ensure that they start happening, because there is no independent scrutiny or checks. It is precisely why we need the Human Rights and Equal Opportunity Commission to have access. </span>

                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I come back again to the fact that the government are more concerned about hiding what is going on in these places than making sure that they are following their own policies or the recommendations of the Houston report. The fact is that those things are in the report and they have not been done. You are more interested in trying to cover it up. That is the truth of it. They are not in law and they are not binding. This government would prefer that it stayed out of the public eye—that Australian taxpayers did not know that they are spending $10 billion on decrepit, inhumane, wet, insufficient camps of cruelty. That is the reality of this. Chair, I ask that the amendments be put.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This is fundamental to allowing not just proper scrutiny of the conditions within these camps but also proper scrutiny and assurances for the Australian taxpayer. Australian taxpayers are paying $10 billion a year, including this year, with the establishment of these awful camps. These are Australian run camps. They are Australian funded, they are managed by Australian representatives and most of the workers in these places are Australian. This is all under the auspices of Australia. The Australian people have a right to know what is going on in these camps and what their money is being spent on.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This amendment does not allow for the doors to be flung open and for anyone to come in and take photographs and footage. It requires that there be an agreement and a proper media access protocol established, with assurances from the host country that the media will be able to gain access, interview those who wished to be interviewed and take photographs of the conditions—all within an appropriate protocol. We do not even have a protocol at the moment. There are no rules against visiting these detention centres, apart from the fact that the government says you cannot. Media agencies here in Australia have for some time now been able to talk to and interview people within Australian detention centres if they follow the appropriate media access protocols. All this amendment is asking for is that the same type of access be available on Manus Island and Nauru. It is common sense—it allows for proper transparency and proper scrutiny, and it gives an assurance to the Australian people that they can find out what is going on in these places. </span>
                </p>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">It should not be that difficult for the government to give assurances that media who follow the appropriate rules can have access—unless, of course, the government have something to hide; unless, of course, what is going on in these places is so atrocious, so out of step, that they do not want the Australian people to know. I have a question for the minister: will the government allow for the establishment of these media access protocols and allow for media to visit these detention centres to find out what is really going on?</span>

As sovereign nations, it is the exclusive decision of the governments of Nauru and PNG to determine to whom they grant lawful entry into their respective countries. As a corollary to that, access to regional processing centres is at the discretion of the governments of Nauru and PNG and it is not appropriate that that be legislated by the Australian government. </span>

                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">South Australia</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">11:17</span>):  I have brought these amendments to the chamber today because there is no guarantee that anything that the minister has just described will happen. Back in October I asked the minister and the department during Senate estimates when we would get media protocols and access guidelines for Manus Island and Nauru. We were told they would have a look at it; they might try to draft something. That was almost nine months ago. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This government have no intention to provide proper scrutiny and transparency of what is going on in these god-awful places. No commitment could be undertaken that would convince anyone that they are serious about doing this. If they believe it is important, they can make sure it goes in the act. I am not dictating how the provisions have to look, or in what time frame they have to be put in place. They have already had nine months and nothing has eventuated. I am saying that the act must stipulate that it should be done. Otherwise, we know there is absolutely no way the Australian people can trust the government to do this. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The Australian people know there is no way we can trust this government on anything to do with asylum seekers and refugees. Every time we are promised something, the promise is broken. Every time we are told people will be treated properly, we find out they are not. Every time we hear children will not be subject to harsh treatment, we find out they are being subjected to harsh treatment. Every time we hear from the government that they are working on making the system fairer, we find out there has been nothing done. Unless it is in the act, it will not happen.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I do not believe the other side would be any more inclined to stick to their word. I do not have any hope that, if we had a coalition government, they would be allowing the media to access detention centres on Manus Island or Nauru either. If this government believe that it should happen and that it is important, they should put it in law. They either believe it is important and it needs to be in the legislation—particularly ahead of the September election—or they do not. The fundamental message from all this is that there is no commitment to proper scrutiny of what is going on in these places, and there is absolutely no way the government wants the media finding out about it.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">A couple of weeks ago the <span style="font-style:italic;">Four Corners</span><span style="font-style:italic;"></span>report on Manus Island and Nauru was aired. That footage had to be smuggled out. What does that say about our government and our laws—that the only way to find out how we are treating vulnerable refugees, under a system we are paying billions of dollars for, is to smuggle out footage of these places? </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">What does that say about basic democracy, about fundamental understandings of transparency, about how we spend our money, about how we treat people and about how the government is in line with the law? When it gets to a point where refugees have to smuggle out footage of the conditions they are in, or Australians have to go in to get it and sneak it out, to give us an understanding of what is really going on, that is not something Australia should be proud of. These conditions are more like those in some of the countries these people fled from in the first place. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">It is clear that the only take-home message from all of this is that the government does not want the Australian people to see what is really going on inside. If there is nothing to hide then let the media in and commit to putting it in law so that it cannot be abused, so that there is no ambiguity about the right of media to speak to people in detention, to see the conditions and to report back to the Australian people about how their money is being spent and how these individuals are being treated. If there is nothing to hide, then open the doors.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The final amendments the Australian Greens are moving this morning concern children and families being detained on Manus Island. There are a number of people within the Australian community—and this is also reflected in here and in the other place—who are incredibly uncomfortable with the indefinite detention of children on Manus Island. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We know that the conditions there are substandard. The UNHCR has told us that. We know that the conditions are inappropriate for children, harmful for children. Not only has the UNHCR said that; Amnesty International has also told us that. We know that even the government's own Department of Immigration and Citizenship believes that the current conditions on Manus Island are pretty poor.</span>

                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Many Australians were shocked and horrified when the <span style="font-style:italic;">Four Corners</span> report was aired a couple of weeks ago and they saw the conditions children were being kept in. There are other people in this place, from other parties, who also do not believe that vulnerable children and their families should be kept on Manus Island. Senator Cameron has said that he does not believe that children should be kept on Manus Island. I agree with Senator Cameron. The opposition's spokesperson on immigration, Mr Morrison, has said that he is uncomfortable with the idea of children being kept on Manus Island.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">When I went to Manus Island at the end of January, before parliament resumed this year, I met with the children who were being detained there. It was a pretty harrowing experience. When I was there, there were 35 children. The youngest was seven; the oldest was 17. There was one little boy who was very clearly distressed. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I met the children without their parents—I had their parents' consent. I met with them, sat with them and talked with them. They all talked to me about how awful it was being locked up there. They asked what they had done—what was the bad thing they had done which meant they had to be locked up in this prison? This little boy, who was clearly depressed, told me that he was scared and upset but that he could not cry. He had stopped himself from crying—because every time he cries, his mum cries. And his mum cries all the time. This is that little boy's picture: 'My mum is crying and I am sad.' This is the naked truth of what we are doing to children on Manus Island. Other children talked about how they felt as if they were locked in prison. This is a picture of a young boy staring out from inside the fence: 'This is a boy; he is in prison and waiting.' This is from an eight-year-old child.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">They were all taken to Manus Island on a plane and they told me the stories of how they were taken there. They were ripped out of their beds on Christmas Island, some of them at four or five o'clock in the morning. They were given no warning. They were put onto the plane in the middle of the night. They talked about how they had had to take the almost 10-hour flight—there was a stopover where they remained on the plane—while still in their pyjamas, terrified about what was going to happen to them.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">They are in this camp, which is hideous. Not one person, aside from the immigration minister, believes that these conditions are appropriate. It is a place of cruelty. In this hideous, hideous camp, there is really nothing for these children to do, so they are watching all the time, and, when they see planes flying over, they think the plane is coming to get them to take them back to safety. 'When there is an aeroplane in the sky, all the kids start to cry and ask for leaving Manus with it.' That was from a 10-year-old child that I met when I was on Manus Island.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I know this issue is difficult. I have never argued that there is a simple solution to addressing the needs of asylum seekers who arrive on our shores. I do not think there is a simple solution. But I do not believe that we should be punishing children in some way to pretend that there is a simple solution. We are sacrificing these children's lives. We are—and I do not say this lightly—subjecting these children to child abuse, to institutionalised abuse, to child abuse by policy. We are creating a damaged generation. Most of these kids, at the end of this, are going to come to Australia, be given protection, because they deserve it, and become Australian citizens—and we have damaged them. We have damaged them. They will become the next damaged generation.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Children and their families cannot be kept in detention in these camps of horror. We must bring them to Australia, assess their claims fairly, treat them with care—look after these poor kids. These children have fled some of the most horrendous circumstances we can imagine—war, torture, brutality. They have seen their parents subjected to torture. And now we have them locked up in conditions that are inhumane, where they are witnessing adults who are under so much pressure that they are threatening to take their own lives, attempting self-harm—and these kids are seeing it all. It is not right. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We debate in this place all the time how we manage this issue. There has to be something said for protecting children and standing up for the rights of these children when they are totally voiceless. If we do not do it in this place, who is going to? If we cannot see that subjecting these children to these types of conditions is dangerous, is harmful, is cruel, what will be we prepared to do next? It was wrong when John Howard detained children in Woomera. It was wrong when John Howard detained children on Manus Island. It is wrong today to have children detained in our detention centres. It is wrong to be detaining children on Manus Island. We have the capacity to assess their claims here and stop treating them like animals, subjecting them to abuse and creating the next damaged generation. I seek leave to table our pictures.</span>

                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Tasmania</span>—<span class="HPS-MinisterialTitles">Leader of the Australian Greens</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">11:42</span>):  I rise today to support these amendments and to speak on behalf of children. I ask people to think about what is going on today on Manus Island, where we are punishing children because they are seeking asylum in our country. They are children, they have come here and they are asking Australia to assess their refugee status, to bring them in and to take care of them. I compare it with what we are doing now in the criminal justice system in this country, where the criminal justice system says there have to be exceptional circumstances in which you would detain a child and that detention should only be used for children who have committed serious and violent crimes. These children have committed no serious and violent crime. These children have simply asked to come and be part of our community and our society—and that is why this legislation that we are debating here today is a stain on our national character. I put to all of you: is this how you would want your family and your children to be treated if you found yourselves seeking asylum somewhere else in the world? Look at your own children, think about your own children and ask yourself: would you be prepared for your children to be locked up indefinitely on Manus Island—yes or no? Would that be okay for your own children? If it would not be okay for your own children, why is it okay to punish other children?</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Earlier this week I spoke in here to give the Greens' wholehearted support to the apology to people who had been subjected to forced adoption. But it is not the first time parliaments have had to apologise. We also apologised to the stolen generations of Indigenous children who were taken away. We have also stood up and apologised to the forgotten Australians, the child migrants who came here and who were lied to, locked up, institutionalised and abused; we have apologised to them. And we have apologised for forced adoptions. And every single time we get up and say: 'Oh—if only we had known,' or 'It was the culture of the period,' or 'What a shocking thing was happening to these children, and it ought not to have happened.' And we have admitted that we created a scarred generation, in each of those cases, that has gone on for generations ever since. The difference is: not one of you who votes against this amendment, in 10 years, 15 years or 20 years, when there is a national apology to the children detained indefinitely in detention for the sole supposed crime of seeking a better life in our country because they are running away from persecution with their families—not one of you will be able to stand up and say: 'Oh, we didn't know,' or, 'It was the culture of the period,' or, 'It was the best way, we thought, of saving their lives, by locking them up in detention in places which the UNHCR has said are completely unsuitable.'</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The UNHCR went to Manus Island, and their report speaks for itself. They say that it is totally inappropriate, the way that children are being detained there. But this parliament seeks to take no notice of that. This parliament seeks to perpetrate the lie—and it is a lie—that locking people up in indefinite detention is saving their lives because it is stopping them drowning. Well, that was a ridiculous proposition in the first place and it remains a ridiculous proposition.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Since you have taken these measures, the more cruel they get, the more people are arriving in our country. That is why we are here today—because you are excising the whole of the Australian mainland in order to take away people's human rights. That is what you are actually doing here today, because more and more people are arriving as you get more and more cruel. That says to me that your deterrence policy does not work, has not worked, will not work, is not working right now, and more and more and more people are risking their lives, not fewer and fewer and fewer. So you are actually deliberately choosing cruelty. You are deliberately choosing to punish children. And there is no justification for it at all—none. Look in the eyes of a child and say: 'What crime have you committed? The crime you have committed is: as a child, you have come here with your family to seek a better life.' And, as I said, if you were in the criminal justice system, no child would be detained unless they had committed a serious or violent crime.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">If this parliament will not stand up for children, who will? Is it any wonder that every mental health expert in the country is saying that we are driving people into more and more desperate circumstances? These children are witnessing the mental torment of their parents. They are put in vulnerable circumstances. Not only are they in physically difficult circumstances on Manus Island, as has been shown to the country with television footage—it is hot; it is humid; it is a bad place to be keeping people in terms of the physical environment—but the mental cruelty, the torture, that is going on on an ongoing basis, every day, to those children is unacceptable. You all know about it. Many of you have your own children. You all think it is fine for somebody else's children to be punished, to be kept in indefinite detention, to suffer the mental scars for the rest of their lives—but it is okay, because your children will never be in that position.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Well, I am very glad to be standing here today on behalf of those children. I am very proud to be standing here with my Green colleagues—with Senator Sarah Hanson-Young who has just spoken so eloquently on behalf of those children and reported on the visit that she made to those children on Manus Island earlier this year. And it is not just the Greens. The UNHCR is saying it. But this parliament chooses to ignore the UNHCR.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The hypocrisy here is extreme when it comes to many members of the Labor government because, in 2006, when John Howard tried to excise the whole country, Labor was up in arms and the Greens spoke strongly against it then and it was not proceeded with. But now Labor in government has done what the former Prime Minister John Howard was not able to do. You have gone even further. Every day you come up with more and more cruel options. Every day those options cost the Australian people huge amounts of money, in a budgetary sense, with a massive blow-out for your cruel detention centres.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">But it is not the financial cost which is the greatest cost to the nation. The greatest cost to the nation is the disappointment, the heartbreak, the mental damage and the scarring, as well as the physical damage, of a whole generation, the majority of whom are going to be found to be refugees who meet the criteria under the refugee convention. What are you going to say to them when, at some point, you decide that your 'no advantage' clause is completely unacceptable? What are you going to say about having locked up these children and deprived them of media access? You know it is wrong; otherwise, you would be allowing the media in there to take pictures and to talk to people. You know it is wrong. Not only is it 'Out of sight, out of mind'; it is about, 'Lock them up, throw away the key, pull down the curtains; let's not show people what we are doing.'</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The media has been able to show some images, and this parliament has been shown some drawings. You know what is going on: you are choosing cruelty to children; you are choosing punishment for innocent children. I ask, when these amendments are put, that you think very carefully as you vote, and as your name is recorded against this vote, of what you are going to say to your own children when they ask you, 'Why did you do this?' And please don't lie to your own children and say, 'I did it to save their lives,' because your policy is not saving lives by stopping anyone getting on boats and coming here by sea—there has been a quadrupling of the numbers of people coming on boats. So if that is your concern then you should abolish this policy at once, because this policy has, in your eyes, driven a greater increase.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">But the fact is, whether you like it or not, that if you send an army into Iraq on a lie, if you cause the problems that have occurred subsequent to the war in Iraq, you will have refugees leaving Iraq. If you go into Afghanistan, and you witness what is going on in Afghanistan, and you say that the Taliban in Afghanistan must be defeated, and that is why we have troops there, and people are running away from the Taliban—the people we agree are cruel; the people we agree are persecuting the Hazara—don't then say, 'Yes, run away, but don't come to us, because we will lock you up and keep you there indefinitely, because we don't want you in our country.'</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">It is the same in Sri Lanka. You all know that the Rajapakse regime in Sri Lanka is carrying out, as we speak, persecution and human rights abuses in Sri Lanka right now. You all know that, and yet you are pretending you do not. The reason we are getting more and more Sri Lankans is that they are being persecuted by the Rajapakse. You have just had the International Commission of Jurists bring out a report talking about the impeachment of the chief justice; you have had reports of what is going on in that country, with disappearances, where academics are disappearing in white vans—you have had all of those things. And yet you choose to pretend and listen to the Rajapakse saying, 'No, everything's fine in Sri Lanka; it's not a problem.' Well, it is a problem—and that is why people are leaving, and you know it. So you all know that the reason people are leaving their countries is that they are persecuted.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I went to the Pontville detention centre not long ago, when 129 children, unaccompanied minors aged between 14 and 18—young men—were brought to that detention centre. And they talked about the persecution that they had suffered and that they had run away from. You know that is happening; you know the Hazara are being persecuted; you know they are genuine refugees—but you choose base domestic politics of fear and mean-spiritedness above decency, humanity and compassion when it comes to the treatment of children. That is what you are doing. We are standing here in this parliament to make a plea for those children: bring them home from Manus Island. Bring them home now. Bring their families home. Bring them to Australia and have them assessed against their asylum-seeking claims. Don’t do what you are doing and excise the whole country and go into the same immoral space where the former Prime Minister, John Howard, tried to take Australia and where you are now taking this nation.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">It is a stain on the national character. It is a shocking day for Australia—you have got together and suspended standing orders to drive this through so that ahead of an election you can brag out in the community that you have been crueller than John Howard, that you have been even more extreme in your punishment of children. Congratulations—I hope you all feel really good about that! When you vote for this, I would ask you to explain to your own children why they should not be on Manus Island and why other people's children should be locked up, detained indefinitely, treated cruelly and subjected to mental punishment and torture. For the rest of their lives they will have to deal with what this parliament thinks is an appropriate way to treat children. I urge you to support these amendments.</span>

                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">South Australia</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">12:05</span>):  Despite the Greens' support for more information to be given to parliament in relation to how many cases the department is managing, there is a big get-out clause in this amendment which renders this entire amendment useless, and it is item (2). Despite the list of things that the minister is required to include in a report at the end of each financial year, under schedule (1), the amendment states:</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">(2) However, a report under this section need deal with a particular regional processing country in accordance with subsection (1) only so far as information provided by the country makes it reasonably practicable for the report to do so.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Time and time again, the government say they will do these things and then give themselves a get-out clause so that none of it has to happen. That is why, when we saw the allowance for Manus Island to be used for offshore processing, we did not have the information about what conditions people would be living in, how people would be treated or what services would be provided—because the act gives the minister total discretion as to what information he gives the parliament. For the minister to not give information, he just has to say he does not think it is reasonable. So this whole amendment is basically useless and it will not be getting the Greens' support.</span>

We are about to excise Australia's entire mainland. We have dealt with amendments that relate to the detention of children on Manus Island. We have dealt with amendments that relate to giving appropriate media access to these detention centres. We have dealt with an amendment in relation to ensuring that Australia's Human Rights Commission has access. There is no evidence that this bill, if passed, will save any lives. In fact, all the evidence is to the contrary. It is going to cost people's lives and damage people who are already suffering from such harm.</span>

We think it is very important for people to understand that this is how desperate both the Labor Party and the Liberal Party are in the race to the bottom on refugees. They have discarded all proper process and are simply ramming this through. The result will mean more suffering, more harm and more damage to refugees who have fled war. It is a pretty low point in this parliament. It is a pretty low point for our country. John Howard could not succeed in getting this done, but Julia Gillard has.</span>

                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">However, ACMA responded that because the chips were virtual and gamblers were therefore not technically playing for real money, DoubleDown was not covered by the definition of 'gambling service' and therefore not subject to the provisions in the Act.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">In short, there was nothing ACMA could do.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">I also wrote to Minister Conroy, who responded that this matter would be considered as part of his Department's review of the Act. However, no changes were suggested or implemented on this matter once the review was concluded.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">This is a clear loophole in relation to online gambling regulation. It is a simple matter of consumer protection, and the fact that this definition in the Act has failed to keep pace with technology, and it doesn't take into account the way many of these sites operate. The current legislation is 12 years old. Given the rapid take-up of online gambling and the expansion of the industry, it needs to be overhauled.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">DoubleDown is not a one-off example. On a similar front, Zynga Poker is an online gambling game where players also use virtual items or credits to bet. However, Zynga goes one step further and sells 'gift cards;' in supermarkets and toy stores, which can be used to purchase items within the game. These cards can be purchased, using real money, by children as young as thirteen – or even younger, if that restriction is not enforced at the point of sale.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">Zynga, like DoubleDown, does not allow these virtual credits to be cashed out. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">Dr Charles Livingstone of Monash University is an expert in gambling behaviours, and has previously spoken out about his concerns with these kinds of online games and the access children have to them.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">Earlier this year, speaking to the ABC he said:</span>

                    <span style="font-style:italic;">s hard for governments to act when these things emerge but I do think that it is an important priority that they act to ensure that young people do not have access to games which mimic existing gambling opportunities and which have the potential to create a whole new generation of gambling-dependent young folk.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Small">We have seen multiple examples of games played through social media or online gaming where buying virtual items with real cash is commonplace. These virtual items become a de facto currency for the game and take on an intrinsic value.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">There have even been court cases overseas where people have been charged and penalised for the theft of virtual items.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">We are lagging seriously behind in consumer protection measures on this front. These games are genuine gambling activities and involve the loss of real money; in fact, they cannot truly be called 'games' at all.</span>

                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">They need to be appropriately regulated and controlled so that consumers, including children, are protected.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">This bill amends the definition of 'gambling service' to specify that 'items of value' include virtual tokens, credits, coins, objects or any similar thing that is purchased within, or as part of, or in relation to, the game.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">This will ensure that sites such as DoubleDown and Zynga have to come clean about their activities, and that consumers will know whether they are participating in gambling activities or not.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">It will also ensure that these sites are not available to children.</span>

                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">This measure is straightforward and necessary, and it will significantly improve consumer protection and online gambling regulation in Australia.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Small">There are already thousands of Australian couples planning to marry in New Zealand from late 2013 onwards. There is no residency requirement in the New Zealand Marriage Act so Australian same-sex couples will be free to marry there. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">Those couples will join the many Australians who have been travelling the world over the past decade to get married, only to come back home to the country that they love to find their marriage is not recognised. Despite being legally married in the foreign country, in their homeland they step off the plane and have to leave their marriage at the customs gate.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">This is not in the spirit of what Australians really want to see in this country. Public support for marriage equality is the same in New Zealand as in Australia, which is that a 65% majority of people want to see marriage equality happen. But as long as we do not have full marriage equality here in Australia, we should at least recognise the marriages of all couples – lesbian, gay and straight – who have legally married overseas. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">This bill offers a modest and practical step forward to marriage equality and it is consistent with the foundational Australian ideal of equality before the law. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">The marriages that are the subject of this Bill have been entered into by the parties with sincerity and commitment and are valid marriages under the law of the county where it was solemnised. The couples have gone to the effort and emotional investment of organising a wedding in a foreign country, often at great expense and involving family and friends from Australia, and they have made vows that would be life-long if they were to remain in the country where the wedding was held. The solemnity of the vows that these couples made overseas should be recognised by Australia's parliament and people. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">There a number of countries that recognise international same sex marriages without having domestic laws to perform same-sex marriages, including Israel, Slovenia, Japan and the Netherlands.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">Couples from those countries can marry in one of the fourteen countries which have marriage equality, such as Argentina, the Netherlands, France or New Zealand, and then return to have their marriage recognised under the laws of their homeland. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">It makes legal and moral sense for Australians to have the same privilege. These married couples are not the legal strangers that our laws say they are. Rather, they are two committed, loving, validly married people under the laws of a foreign nation and they should be recognised under Australian as such.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">I commend this Bill to the Senate.</span>

                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">The purpose of this bill is to amend the Competition and Consumer Act to create specific provisions for country of origin labelling requirements for food.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">In doing so it responds to key recommendations from the Independent Blewett Review of food labelling in Australia in his report "Labelling Logic". </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">At the heart of these recommendations is the contention that that country of origin labelling for food should be treated differently from other goods because, as Blewett noted "food is ingested unlike other consumer goods that are just used". However, it should be addressed through consumer law rather than food safety standards, as ultimately it is a matter of truth and accuracy in labelling.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">This bill responds to these recommendations by creating a specific provision in the Competition and Consumer Act for the treatment of country of origin claims for food with some proportion of Australian content, separate from other goods. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">To assist with the well-documented confusion arising from current country of origin labelling practises, this bill sets out to create a simple three-tier standard of labelling for food with any form of Australian origin or processing.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">In the first instance, it retains the well-established premium of 'Product of Australia', where all the significant ingredients and processing must have occurred in Australia to make this claim.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">For fresh unpackaged food, it also allows the use of 'Grown in Australia' as this is a clear and now well-established and understood claim.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">Secondly, for food that has been manufactured in Australia, that is substantially transformed, it requires such packaged food to be labelled 'Manufactured in Australia'. This term is specified to replace 'Made in Australia' because consumer research has shown that people confuse the term 'Made in', thinking it denotes the origin of the food, not just where it was processed. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">This amendment will achieve two important improvements: it will clarify for consumers that the label is about where the food has been processed, not where the ingredients are from; provide a strong label identifying local manufacture to help Australians support local jobs in food processing; and it will help prevent imported food from masquerading as Australian content by making it clear that this label only speaks to the processing, not the ingredients.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">A further reform in this bill is that it provides for the creation of a regulation to provide clear guidance on the meaning of 'substantial transformation' in relation to food processing. It is clear from the evidence that understanding what qualifies as food manufacturing – that is substantial transformation – is a grey area, and some companies push the envelope in their claims. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">It must be remembered that the purpose of the substantial transformation test is to reward significant investment and jobs in local food manufacturing. The system breaks down if manufacturing claims are made for much lesser and often more transient investments. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">Therefore this bill recommends that a regulation on the definition of substantial transformation provide a list of processes that do not qualify. This would significantly increase the clarity and transparency of 'Manufactured in Australia' claims, and support local food processing jobs.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">It is worth noting too, that historically the companies investing in genuine food manufacturing in Australia are the most likely to also be sourcing local food for their products. To further encourage clear labelling of Australian ingredients, this bill allows for the voluntary highlighting of local content that comprise significant ingredients – for example a chocolate might therefore be labelled "Manufactured in Australia from Australian milk".</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">This allows for the fact that there are some foods manufactured in Australia that don't use all local ingredients for the simple reason that Australia does not produce it in sufficient quantity for it to be possible – cocoa beans for making chocolate being a good example. But it does allow for local significant ingredients to be differentiated, which in turn means that consumers can reward local content and greater transparency at the cash register.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">Finally the bill establishes a third tier of labelling to deal with packaged food that does not have sufficient Australian content or processing to qualify for the other claims. At the moment these products use the least understood – by as little as 3% of Australians in fact – and most frustrating current country of origin claims, those known as 'qualified claims' – terms such as 'Made from imported and local ingredients'. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">These vague catch-all statements at best confuse and frustrate consumers, and they certainly don't support informed decisions. This bill prohibits them, and instead requires any packaged food that has some level of Australian processing or content, but that does not meet 'Product of' or 'Manufactured in' claims to simply say "Packaged in Australia".</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">By providing three tiers of country of origin claims, this bill offers an opportunity to greatly simplify a complex and frustrating area of food labelling. It responds specifically to years of consumer research, showing that Australians equally want to know where their food is from, and where it was processed. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">I want to now briefly describe the process of how this bill has come about. Fifteen months ago I introduced the Competition and Consumer Act (Australian Food Labelling) Bill 2012 to the parliament, a bill which I have now withdrawn. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">The Competition and Consumer Act (Australian Food Labelling) Bill sought to implement the key recommendations of the Blewett Review as I have outlined before, and also those in which he recommended that country of origin labelling of food be based solely on the origin of the ingredients. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">My previous bill allowed these key recommendations to be tested, which is a necessity given that food labelling is frequently acknowledged to be an area of great complexity fraught with unintended consequences. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">For this reason I encouraged all interested parties with expertise in the area of country of origin food labelling to make a submission to the Senate inquiry, and urged them to not just focus on critiquing the bill, but if possible provide viable alternatives.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">As a result the senate inquiry was a demonstration of just how effective this core process can be to help focus attention and find solutions in a complex area of law. In addition to submissions from the public expressing support for clearer labelling, I am especially grateful to AUSVEG, the Australian Manufacturers Workers Union, Australian Made Australian Grown, the Australian Food Sovereignty Alliance and CHOICE for their investment of time and goodwill in providing constructive input to the bill. CHOICE deserve special acknowledgement for their work in putting forward viable alternatives to the current labelling system, and my bill reflects the core of their recommendations.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">As a result of this constructive work, we were able to identify which of Blewett's recommendations would be effective, which would not, and clear common ground for reform in an area of great interest to many Australians. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">The Competition and Consumer (Australian Country of Origin Food Labelling) Bill that I introduce today is the product of that process.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">I want to once more put on record why this issue is so important. This is a topic on which there is a clear and united public view. Whenever the question is asked, overwhelmingly Australians tell us that they want to be able to easily identify and buy Australian-grown food, and overwhelmingly they are frustrated in that desire by current country of origin labelling.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">CHOICE provided updated comprehensive research to this effect as part of their submission to the senate inquiry into the Competition and Consumer Amendment (Australian Food Labelling) Bill this year, once again confirming Australia's desire to have clear country of origin labelling that allows them to easily identify and choose to purchase food grown and processed in Australia. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">I believe this bill offers a tangible step forward to improving country of origin labelling for food, one that has support from organisations representing Australian growers, local jobs in food manufacturing and information transparency for consumers.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">There are no doubt further reforms we could and should consider over time. It is still difficult for example, for some forms of local processing that supports local jobs to get recognition under these proposed labelling claims - and the existing one. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">But the ability to pursue further improvements should not be used as a reason to oppose the reforms this bill offers. We must remember that over half of Australians are very clear that they do make food purchasing decisions based on whether the food is local. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">For Australian farmers and food manufacturers, this bill is urgent. As the news continues to be filled with stories of Australian food manufactures going into administration or slashing their intake of local content, and as Australian farmers struggle to keep market share at home against a rising tide of cheap imports, it has never been more timely to help Australians identify and buy local food. It is time to act.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">I commend this bill to the Senate.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I seek leave to continue my remarks later.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">

                  </a>  This motion is about recognition of the terrible tragedy that we have seen unfolding in Bangladesh over the last two weeks with the collapse of the Rana Plaza building and the subsequent civil disobedience that we have seen around that in Bangladesh. It is also a recognition of the role that we as consumers play in Australia and how we are linked to that and what we can do to prevent these things happening in the future. We often talk about fair trade and free trade in this building. This tragedy is a recognition that this is very real and that there are certain things that we can do to make a difference here.

                  </a>  I indicate at this stage that I will not seek to call a division on this motion. This motion is about a place that the people of Rockingham, who have been stepping up in its defence, believe is too precious to lose. That, of course, is Point Peron, which is under threat by the state government—of all people—who are the proponents for a completely inappropriate marina. I particularly want to acknowledge Dawn Jecks, who has campaigned tirelessly for the values of Point Peron on behalf of the whole community. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Point Peron was granted back to the state from the Commonwealth in 1964 on the provision that it be protected in perpetuity as public recreation and parklands. Depending on the way this vote goes, I suspect we will see the two old parties voting down a very simple motion that that commitment be upheld. It is quite clear that the Greens are the only ones left who are standing up for places like Point Peron, which we know is too precious to lose. I am proud to stand up with the community of Rockingham in the defence of this place.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Small">This bill follows up the recent landmark legislation underpinning the first stage of DisabilityCare Australia, the National Disability Insurance Scheme, by making minor clarifying and consequential amendments to complement the main legislation.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">The National Disability Insurance Scheme Act 2013, passed earlier this year, establishes DisabilityCare Australia, —the National Disability Insurance Scheme.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">This will enable the scheme to be launched, and DisabilityCare Australia to operate the launch, in four sites across Australia from July 2013 – in South Australia, Tasmania, the Hunter region in New South Wales, and the Barwon area of Victoria – and, from July 2014, in the Australian Capital Territory and the Barkly region of the Northern Territory.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">This bill makes minor amendments to the legislation to clarify the policy intention in relevant provisions, and to address minor anomalies and technical errors.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">These technical changes will make sure that all of the details intended to be specified in the rules – which are necessary for implementation of the first stage of the scheme – will reflect the principal legislation for the scheme.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">For example, provisions that allow rules to be made to prescribe relevant 'criteria' will be clarified to make sure rules can also be made to prescribe 'matters for consideration' or 'factors to be taken into account'.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">Similarly, in the case of the early intervention supports, where there is no intention to make rules and where key eligibility criteria are already set out clearly in the legislation, the current rule-making power is being removed to avoid any risk that those provisions would not be available to people who may benefit from them.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">The bill will strengthen the audit and risk management framework of DisabilityCare Australia. It is critical that the Board adopts a rigorous approach to oversight of DisabilityCare Australia, ensuring that this historic reform is financially sustainable and will support the wellbeing of Australians with disability for decades to come.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">The framework for audit and risk management provides an important assurance that DisabilityCare Australia's operations and risks are being prudently and soundly managed.</span>

                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">Other minor amendments include clarifying the matters to which the CEO must have regard when considering whether to take action to claim or obtain compensation, or take over the conduct of an existing claim. These matters are similar to the matters that the act already requires the CEO to have regard to when deciding whether to require a scheme participant to take compensation action. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">While it is not expected that the CEO will often need to take on or take over compensation claims, the amendments provide clarity to scheme participants and potential participants about what the CEO would need to consider before taking any such action.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">The bill also makes consequential amendments to other Commonwealth Acts to complement the National Disability Insurance Scheme Act 2013.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">The bill will establish a new National Disability Insurance Scheme Division of the Administrative Appeals Tribunal and require that members appointed to the division have expertise relating to disability or other relevant experience.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">The Minister responsible for the scheme will also have to be consulted before a tribunal member can be assigned to the new division.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">These requirements will ensure that applications for review of relevant decisions under the scheme are reviewed by tribunal members with appropriate training, knowledge or experience in this specialised area. A robust external merits review system is integral to supporting fair, efficient and effective decision making under the National Disability Insurance Scheme.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">Amendments to the social security law will include changes to ensure that amounts paid under the National Disability Insurance Scheme for supports funded under a participant's plan are not taken into account under the social security or veterans' entitlements income and assets tests.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">Lastly, among some consequential amendments to the taxation legislation, there will be changes to ensure that payments and benefits provided under the National Disability Insurance Scheme to participants in the scheme are exempt from income tax.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Small">The Bill also makes consequential changes to the upper phase‑in amount for low‑income taxpayers with income between certain thresholds – as well as to the formula for calculating the amount of a person's Medicare levy liability where a person has a spouse or dependants.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Small">A number of other tax rates that include a component for the Medicare levy will also increase in line with this change – these include increases in the rate of fringe benefits tax and excess contributions tax.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Small">Increasing the Medicare levy will raise approximately $20.4 billion between 2014‑15 and 2018‑19 – amounting to approximately 55 per cent of the total cost of funding DisabilityCare Australia over that period. </span>

                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">
                    <a href="D2I" type="MemberSpeech">
                      <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Senator FIFIELD</span>
                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Victoria</span>—<span class="HPS-MinisterialTitles">Manager of Opposition Business in the Senate</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">12:48</span>):  I rise to speak on this package of 13 bills, the first of which is a bill to give effect to an increase in the Medicare levy from 1.5 per cent to two per cent from 1 July next year. There are 10 consequential tax bills. There is also the bill to establish the DisabilityCare Australia Fund, into which the levy proceeds will go. The 13th bill is essentially a housekeeping bill to make a number of amendments to the primary NDIS Act, which was passed in March. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I am pleased to indicate that the opposition was very happy to facilitate yesterday, in quick time, the passage of this legislation through the House of Representatives—courtesy of conversations between Mr Abbott's office and Ms Gillard's office. For the opposition's part, we will ensure that this legislation is passed in quick time through this place. We have already agreed to exempt this legislation from the cut-off and to see it placed in the noncontroversial section of the chamber's agenda for today. We do so because this parliament does have a shared commitment to a better deal for Australians with disability. In the words of Mr Abbott, the 'NDIS is an idea whose time has come'.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Every senator in this chamber knows very well that the system of support for Australians with disability is broken. When we had the debate on the primary NDIS legislation and when we had the Senate Standing Committee on Community Affairs look at that legislation, I think all of us had reinforced the arbitrary nature of disability support around Australia.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">There is consensus that we do need and will be getting a new system of support that is based on need rather than on rationing, where the entitlement will go to the individual, where the individual will be at the centre and in charge and where they will be able to pick their service provider for aids, equipment and other supports that they may receive. This was the vision of the Productivity Commission and it is the vision of the NDIS. I did see Mr David Bowen last night at the Carers Australia 20th anniversary function. I was hoping that he would leave and make it an early night because he needs all the energy he can possibly muster for the great adventure of which he is at this time the chief steward. I know all senators wish him well in the task that he and his staff have.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">It is important to note that the NDIS is also a shared vision not just of the parliament but of every government in Australia and of every opposition in Australia. For its part, the federal coalition has enthusiastically supported each milestone on the road to the NDIS that has reflected the work of the Productivity Commission. We strongly support the six launch sites. We welcome the agreements between the Commonwealth and the states and territories for full jurisdiction-wide rollouts. We supported, as did all colleagues in this place, the NDIS act passed in March.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Mr Abbott demonstrated his personal commitment to Australians with disability and their carers by raising over $1.2 million through the 2012 and 2013 Pollie Pedal charity bike rides. Each year, along the 1,000 kilometre routes, Mr Abbott has met with people with disabilities and with carers, and with the organisations that support them. The next Pollie Pedal will also be in partnership with and raise funds for Carers Australia. For Mr Abbott, his commitment is not just professional; it is certainly personal.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">All comments, questions and suggestions by the opposition in relation to the NDIS have been offered in a constructive spirit and in an endeavour to help make the NDIS be the best that it possibly can be. The coalition has stood ready at all times to work with the government and other parties to see the NDIS delivered as soon as possible. The coalition is strongly of the view that with full implementation of an NDIS, it would be nothing short of a new deal for people with disabilities and their carers. We do have to get this right. Because the NDIS is a once-in-a-generation opportunity to deliver a better deal for Australians with disability, because it will unfold over the lives of several parliaments, we think it is important that the NDIS is seen as the property of the parliament as a whole rather than of any individual political party. When I say 'property of the parliament as a whole', that is on behalf of the Australian people.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">To get this right will require a high level of consultation and attention to detail, not just now but over the full implementation period—not just in the launch sites but over the period of full jurisdiction and live rollout. That is why the coalition has called for the establishment of a joint parliamentary committee to be chaired by both sides of politics to oversee the establishment and implementation of the NDIS. I am very much of the view that a parliamentary oversight committee would serve as a symbol to the Australian community that all parties were locked in to support the NDIS and that it would provide a non-partisan environment in which issues of design and eligibility could be worked through constructively. I have not hidden my disappointment in the past on the three occasions when the parliament has declined the opportunity to support the establishment of this committee. In fact, I think the parliamentary oversight committee is even more important given the advent of a new tax base in the form of the Medicare levy increase that is before us and given the establishment of the DisabilityCare Australia fund into which the levy proceeds will be put. But I am very pleased that the government has now agreed to the establishment of a parliamentary committee that will operate on a bipartisan basis, and that has come about as a result of the interactions between the Prime Minister and the Leader of the Opposition over the last day or so. So, that is indeed good news. The terms of reference are not as extensive as envisaged in our initial proposition. But, should we form government, that is something that we would certainly address.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Let me reiterate that the coalition has supported the establishment of the NDIS every step of the way. We want it to be a success. We do not want it to be a political football. We want it to be a reality as soon as possible. We want to see it on a secure footing. And the best guarantee for the NDIS in the long term is good economic management, good budget management and a government that prioritises within its means. Economic policy and social policy are sometimes presented as alternatives or as being in competition, but they are not. You need a good economic policy in order to afford a good social policy. The Productivity Commission, for its part, recommended that the NDIS be funded from consolidated revenue. I think their view was that core government business should be funded from core government revenue.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Our view has long been that the problem under the current administration was not that Australians did not pay enough tax but rather that the current administration has not been a good steward of the ample taxes paid. We have long predicted that the government's wrong priorities and waste and excessive spending would in fact compromise their ability to fund the NDIS from consolidated revenue. Until a few weeks ago the Prime Minister was also of the view that the NDIS should be funded from consolidated revenue. In fact, she categorically ruled out a levy, or the need for one, as recently as December. Instead, the government found a range of things to spend money on, and there was not adequate provision for the NDIS; hence the government's levy proposition. Our view in relation to the levy is straightforward. We did not propose a levy. There should not be the need for a levy, and the government is only proposing a levy because they have blown the bank and have failed to prioritise. We on this side do not like tax increases, but we do not think Australians with disability should miss out on the better deal they deserve due to poor decisions by this government. I do not think that would pass the fair go test. This legislation that is before us, all 13 pieces of it, will pass with our support, but we do see the Medicare levy increase as being only a temporary measure until the budget has been repaired and is in strong surplus.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I will put our decision into a broader context. We know that the Productivity Commission did not recommend funding the NDIS through a new tax. We understand that many families are doing it tough and that tax increases are an impost on household budgets. That is why, rather than responding immediately, we took our time and soberly considered the government's proposition to increase the Medicare levy. We do know that the current government's management of the economy and its fiscal approach, and the state of the budget as a result of the decisions they have taken, do not currently allow the NDIS to be funded from consolidated revenue without further borrowings. Australians with a disability and their carers want the confidence that the NDIS means a permanent change in the way our country supports people with a disability. People with a disability should not have to wait any longer than is necessary for the support they need. For these reasons the coalition is prepared to support the government's proposed increase to the Medicare levy.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">It is also important to recognise that the Medicare levy increase does not cover the full cost of an NDIS. The levy does not cover the difference between what governments currently spend on disability and the full cost of an NDIS. When you take into account the 25 per cent of levy proceeds that the government will give to the states and territories for 10 years you will note that the levy covers perhaps 40 per cent of the Commonwealth's required contribution to an NDIS in the period after the launch. We continue to call on the government to outline how the remaining 60 per cent of funding will be provisioned. Despite promising before the budget to do so, on the night of the budget the government has as yet failed to outline where the balance of the funds will come from. We will certainly be taking the opportunity of Senate estimates to further explore, unpack and disaggregate some of the funding information which the government provided on budget night.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I do not need to tell anyone that the NDIS is a huge venture of great proportions. According to the Australian Government Actuary, it will have a gross cost of $22 billion in complete form and will require additional contributions from all governments of more than $10½ billion dollars beyond 2018-19. When such a big call is being made on taxpayers they are entitled to know exactly what the NDIS will achieve and who it will support. The government needs to provide greater clarity on that.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The 460,000 Australians who will be supported by the NDIS are entitled to have a full appreciation of the gateway to the scheme. The gateway to the NDIS has a number of elements. There are the eligibility criteria in the act, there are the regulations, known as the NDIS rules, some of which have been released in draft form, and the NDIS national assessment tools, which have not as yet been publicly released.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">When looking at the issue of gateways it is important to recognise that the Productivity Commission report has been in the government's hands for two years, that this is a $22 billion scheme and that there is a new tax base being created in the form of the Medicare levy increase that will part fund the scheme. It is important also to consider it against the backdrop that NDIS launch sites go live in New South Wales, Victoria, South Australia and Tasmania in six weeks time.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">When the opposition indicated we would consider the increase to the Medicare levy we said that the government needed to introduce legislation to establish a fund in which the levy proceeds would be held; the government has done that. We said that the government also needed to legislate to the Future Fund as guardians of the fund, and the government has done that. We also said that the government needed to release the final NDIS rules and the national assessment tool, which has not happened as yet.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">When the opposition has raised the issue of the tools and the rules there have been some who have said that the opposition is getting down into the weeds, but I think it is important to recognise that, for Australians with significant disability, the assessment tools and the NDIS rules are not a theoretical mechanism. They are elements which will combine to underpin the opportunities and quality of life for these individuals.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">It has also been suggested that people who want to know the eligibility arrangements for the scheme should grab a copy of the act. I do not believe that the Prime Minister, in saying that, seriously contended that Australians with disability should grab a copy of the act, grab a set of the draft rules, hunt down the national assessment tool and try to work it out themselves. I have said before and I will reiterate that I think it would be extremely helpful to potential scheme participants if a series of cameos or worked examples were released so that people with physical, sensory, intellectual, cognitive or neurological impairments could have a handle on their likely eligibility under the scheme. The same goes for people with psychiatric conditions. I do not think it is unreasonable to expect this sort of detail for a $22-billion scheme that is due to commence in about six weeks time.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I will draw a contrast with a another significant reform. When the Howard-Costello government was preparing for the new tax system, the GST, the government of the day produced over 1,000 fact sheets and dozens of cameos and worked examples as to the effects of the tax on every type of household and business. This was done more than a year before the legislation came into the parliament and more than two years before the legislation took effect. I cannot imagine that, when Peter Costello was fielding questions about the new tax system, he ever responded that people should grab themselves a copy of the legislation and work it out for themselves. I think there is a need for some accessible cameos and worked examples in addition to the release of the rules and the national assessment tools. In the absence of some of that sort of information it is difficult to develop a complete picture as to how the scheme will work. I want to be clear: this is in no way a criticism of the staff of FaHCSIA or the transition agency. I think they are working as hard as they can. But that information would be helpful.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The opposition will be supporting this legislation. We look forward to working with all parties to see the NDIS become a reality.</span>

                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The legislation represents a combination of a strong community campaign. I congratulate all those campaigners and advocates for the determination and dedication that they have demonstrated over the years. Today is a great day for you, for all of those people out there who have made it their life's work. I congratulate them.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The scheme will support more than 400,000 Australians with a disability, their families and their careers. We know that disability currently affects one in every five Australians and that 95 per cent of Australians will enter the disability community, either temporarily or permanently, at some point in their lives. The scheme will pay for carers to give parents of children with disability a break. I know that everybody will have met or been part of a family trying to support a family member with a disability. It is absolutely essential that people are supported so that they can have a break in order to maintain the ongoing work that they do and to enable them to continue the loving support that they give to their family member with a disability. The increase in the Medicare levy equates to an extra dollar a day for the average income earner and I would suggest that it is a dollar a day well spent.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">As disability advocate Stella Young has said, it is hard to think about dollars when it may mean how many showers we get to have per week or whether we can get a mobility aid that will let us leave our houses. That is the practical reality of how to support people so that they can participate in society. I have to say that Stella Young has been a fantastic advocate for this national disability insurance scheme. I welcome the fact that the trials will be beginning in my home state of Tasmania in July. That will be very genuinely appreciated by the Tasmanian community.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The Greens have successfully amended the legislation to allow the national disability insurance scheme to ensure that the other essential services that people living with a disability need do not end or are not curtailed. Those services include transport, housing and education. This means that service providers will be required to continue to provide those services.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I welcome today's announcement that adopts our recommendation from the inquiry that establishes a trial specifically for Aboriginal people living with a disability. The Australian Greens recognise that Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people living with a disability often have significant difficulty accessing appropriate services. We welcome the flexibility in the scheme to meet those needs.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I recognise the time constraints on this debate and so I will conclude my remarks by reiterating how pleased the Australian Greens are to have the opportunity to stand here today to support the establishment of the national disability insurance scheme. I congratulate my colleagues for their work in ensuring the amendments to the scheme. I congratulate all the advocates. I congratulate the government for the work that has been done on this. I congratulate my colleague Senator Siewert for her dedication to this and for securing these amendments. I look forward to the passage of the legislation and the pilots starting and the money being made available to support the scheme.</span>

I will not take long, because I know that we want this legislation to go through this chamber so that we will have all the foundation pieces in place for a national disability scheme to start rolling out across Australia and so that the launch sites can get going. I have to comment yet again that I am really disappointed that we do not have a launch site in Western Australia because Western Australia has not yet signed up. That is very disappointing. I have had a number of emails from people living with a disability in Western Australia and their carers, people who have been supporting the campaign in Western Australia for a very long time. They have been very outspoken. Those people, like the rest of the people in Australia, want a national disability insurance scheme. They want DisabilityCare to come to Western Australia as well. I urge the Western Australian government and the Commonwealth government to work together to come to a resolution of this impasse. We do not want Western Australians to be missing out on opportunities to get the care and support that other Australians living with a disability will get. People living with a disability in the rest of Australia will get that care and support but unfortunately not those people living in my home state of Western Australia.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This morning I attended—along with the minister and Senator Fifield—the launch of the First People's Disability Network Australia's 10-point plan for the implementation of the NDIS in Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander communities. They articulated a 10-point plan very clearly to the Senate inquiry and that is why the issue was picked up in both the majority report and in the additional comments by the Greens—particularly the need to pay special attention to the rollout of the NDIS into remote Aboriginal communities. The first thing they point out in the plan is the need to recognise that the vast majority of Aboriginal people with disability do not self-identify as people with disability. For a start we need to overcome that particular issue. I credit the government for funding the implementation of this plan and the rollout of NDIS in Aboriginal communities. The Barkly Shire will be a launch site. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">It would give me and other Western Australians so much pleasure to know that there was a launch site in Western Australia, especially in one of the areas that the Western Australian government is focusing on with their My Way sites. This sort of assistance for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander peoples would be enormously beneficial, particularly in the south-west of Western Australia for the Noongar community. I say once again to the Western Australian government: 'Get on board and make this happen in Western Australia so that people in Western Australia can enjoy the same care and support that everybody else in Australia is going to have access to. Get over this whole state-rights difference and let's get on with it and build on the strengths that we have in Western Australia already.' </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The Greens will be supporting this legislation; we have supported the principle of the NDIS from day one. We have tried to be as cooperative as possible to achieve the rollout of this scheme. It gives me great pleasure to support this legislation and to be able to see the beginning of the launch sites in a couple of weeks time.</span>

There are 13 bills to deliver DisabilityCare to Australia, but there are also a number of other bills that need to be passed before 2 o'clock, and so my contribution will be short.

May I thank first senators and especially the Senate Community Affairs Legislation Committee for the work that they have done to facilitate a number of pieces legislation through the parliament. I particularly want to thank people with disability and their families and carers. The co-design that we have been able to do with those people has been amazing. May I also thank all advocates who over many years have wanted to see this day come. I thank the department officials—all of them, and there are many—for the work that they have done. I particularly want to thank DisabilityCare Australia, the agency that will now take carriage of an idea that had its embryo some 25 or more years ago. I want to place on record my personal thanks to Minister Jenny Macklin, who has steered this work over many years, and to the Prime Minister, who engaged and has become totally committed to improving the lives of people with disability. We have legislation; we have the framework; we have the rules; and now we have the funding. It has been my privilege to be part of this historic social reform. Senators, DisabilityCare Australia's day has come. </span>

                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Western Australia</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">13:22</span>):  The opposition supports this legislation, which has as its purpose the amendment of the Intelligence Services Act to extend the application of the Public Service Act governing the voluntary interagency movement of APS employees to the Australian Secret Intelligence Service, thus entitling such employees to move between agencies, to avoid the restrictions and to have more flexibility—flexibility that does not exist if they are subject to the Public Service Regulations 1999. The amendment means that agreements made between APS employees and agency heads will no longer be subject to those regulations, which are quite restrictive, but instead be subject to the Public Service Commissioner's Directions made under the Public Service Act. </span>

They are very hardworking people, and I am very pleased that they will have their terms and conditions of employment enhanced by these amendments.</span>

                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">South Australia</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">13:26</span>):  The coalition support this legislation. This is important legislation in relation to the allocation of spectrum, in particular the spectrum known as the digital dividend. This will allow for that spectrum, which is freed up by the shifting to digital transmission and the restacking that occurs with that, to be utilised while still part of the broadcasting services bands.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This is important reform; however, the coalition do have some concerns, notwithstanding our support for this. In particular, we are concerned about the government's failure to address the concerns of users of wireless audio microphones. Estimates put the number of such devices in Australia at between 120,000 and 150,000. They are commonly used by function centres, community groups, churches, schools and small businesses like gym instructors. Even senators have been known to use wireless audio microphones! These devices operate in the white space of the BSB spectrum, including in the 694 to 820 megahertz spectrum which forms part of the digital dividend. Once the auction process for that spectrum is complete—and that may now be a little further away than was anticipated previously—and the frequency is made available for 4G services, these devices may no longer work. This of course is a concern, one that the government did not appear to be on top of. Thanks to amendments moved in the other place by Mr Turnbull, the shadow minister for communications and broadband, the Australian Communications and Media Authority will be required to review and report on the provision of spectrum for such low-interference potential devices class licences and provide a transition pathway for such licences by 30 June 2013. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">While I understand that many wireless audio devices operate on a set radio frequency, I hope, as does the rest of the coalition, that we will be able to find a suitable solution that ensures that as few of these devices as possible are rendered inoperable and that Senator Conroy's legislation here does not result in unintended consequences. Senator Conroy is a master of unintended consequences, and I could spend a long time addressing the broader issue of spectrum simply to highlight the fact that Senator Conroy's failure to manage his portfolio was once again on show in the most recent auction of spectrum and the fact that his personal intervention, against the advice of the ACMA, to set a higher reserve price has left spectrum sitting on the shelf and ensured the government failed to meet its budget expectations in that regard. As I said, it is another demonstration of Senator Conroy's failure in his portfolio—just another example to go with so many others.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Notwithstanding the minister's great failures on these issues, we know this legislation is necessary. We supported the transition to digital; we of course want to see the spectrum utilised in the most efficient way possible. That is why the coalition are concerned that so much of it will now be left sitting on the shelf. We support this legislation that would facilitate its usage, and in particular usage where the spectrum has managed to be sold.</span>

                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Victoria</span>—<span class="HPS-MinisterialTitles">Manager of Opposition Business in the Senate</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">13:31</span>):  The Not-for-profit Sector Freedom to Advocate Bill seeks to invalidate clauses in Commonwealth agreements with the not-for-profit sector that restrict or prevent not-for-profit entities from advocating on Commonwealth law, policy or actions. The coalition, in opposition, has frequently stated its belief that not-for-profit organisations should not be treated as agencies or instruments of government, and it is fitting that we speak on this bill during National Volunteer Week. It is important to pause and remember that there are over 600,000 not-for-profits in Australia. We have a robust civil society and our nation would not be the same without our volunteers or these not-for-profit organisations.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">On this side of the chamber we share the view that the state should be doing all it can to assist these organisations to do what they do best, to get on with their core business. We start with the principle that the government should do no harm to the endeavours of the not-for-profit sector. The coalition does have a plan to enable the not-for-profit sector to spend more time focusing on their core activities and our plan places the state at the service of Australia's civil society rather than the other way around. Our plan will cut red tape and support service providers; it will free up the regulatory burden that the not-for-profit sector currently has imposed on it. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We also have concerns about the large new regulator, the Australian Charities and Not-for-profits Commission. As I say, we want to help organisations focus on what they do best. We do recognise that there is a place for a national body to enhance the role of institutions in civil society but our view is that, rather than the current commission, there should be a small organisation that would act as an educative and training body—a centre of excellence for the sector. The coalition version of the organisation would seek to perform that role. It would also seek to act as a one-stop shop for information on charitable organisations and agencies operating in Australia, advocate for the rights of charities and not-for-profit agencies and represent the interests of those organisations to government. It would also undertake research and cross-sector evaluations of issues of concern to the sector and help to foster innovation.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">It is important that the state be at the service of civil society. We should do no harm to their efforts. The government should be a facilitator but it should not intrude upon the operation of the not-for-profit sector. The coalition, for its part, wants to work with the sector and ensure that the well-intentioned activities of government do not work against it.</span>

                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Western Australia</span>—<span class="HPS-MinisterialTitles">Australian Greens Whip</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">13:34</span>):  I am pleased to support the Not-for-profit Sector Freedom to Advocate Bill so that we do not see history repeating itself, and I am pleased that the bill will go through with united support from across the chamber. This is a critical piece of legislation. It responds to a recommendation that the Greens made during the debate on the Australian Charities and Not-for-profits Commission late last year, and I am glad that we are able to debate it now and that it is being adopted as non-controversial legislation. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We are strongly supportive of the not-for-profit and charity sector in Australia. I have articulated that support in this place on many occasions. We believe that the sector plays an absolutely essential role in delivering critical services, advocacy and support for communities, but most importantly it plays a critical role in our civil society and democracy. These organisations play a leading role in the development of policy and are fierce advocates for many in our community, particularly the most marginalised and vulnerable groups. They provide enduring advocacy for the disability sector—advocates, service providers, people with disability—and they themselves have been lobbying and campaigning to raise awareness of the need for better services and more funding for disability services. I would go so far as to say that if it were not for those people and their advocacy, we would not have an NDIS today. The legislation we passed today is a result of that advocacy work. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Independence is critical to securing a robust and sustainable sector, and no government that truly wants to make this country a better place should expect not-for-profit organisations to basically sit there, shut up and quietly provide services without advocating for their clients or calling for systemic change. Unfortunately, sometimes government has a virtual monopoly over funding arrangements. It is often the sole contractor or the sole funder for important social environment programs, which leads to an imbalance in power in contract negotiations between governments and service providers and the not-for-profit sector. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">In the past we have seen attempts to use those contracting arrangements to stop organisations carrying out advocacy. That is why the Greens believe it is so important that this legislation goes through and that it will protect the independence of the not-for-profit sector and ensure that governments do not use their position to stop not-for-profit advocacy. This was discussed during the ACNC Bill debate. I am really pleased that the government has brought this on and that it also moved at that time to make sure that the government standards did not impinge on the independence and advocacy role of the not-for-profit organisations. We will, of course, be supporting this legislation. We congratulate the government for bringing it on. The Greens will ensure that we hold all to this piece of legislation and ensure that the sentiments expressed in this chamber today are upheld in the future.</span>

                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">Australia’s aviation security framework is under continuous review to ensure it is responsive to changes in the aviation security environment including the deterrence, detection and prevention of acts of unlawful interference with an aircraft.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">It is apparent that at times it may be necessary for Australia to place restrictions on certain cargo being carried on Australian aircraft, or being carried into Australia on foreign nationality aircraft.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">This fact was highlighted on 29 October 2010, when two improvised explosive devices were discovered on board aircraft in Dubai and the United Kingdom.  </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">The devices were hidden in printers and sent from Yemen to the United States as air cargo consignments. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">They were intercepted en route following an intelligence tip-off. </span>

                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">Such events show the potential for inbound air cargo to pose an unacceptable security risk to Australians and Australian interests.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">While providing for a security framework covering outbound international air cargo, current provisions under the Aviation Transport Security Act 2004 do not provide specific mitigation measures to counter the threat posed by inbound international air cargo.  </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">The proposed legislative amendment addresses this issue and will ensure that the Government has a sound, transparent and effective legal basis to mitigate the threat posed to Australia by international inbound air cargo in the future.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">In 2010, responding to the Yemen incident, the Government moved to prohibit air cargo originating in, or transiting through, Yemen or Somalia from being carried to Australia.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">This was initially achieved through the issuing of Special Security Directions. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">However, Special Security Directions only operate for a six month period as they were deliberately created as a short-term measure, providing an appropriate means to quickly deal with emerging security threats.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">Upon their expiration, the effect of the prohibition was continued by requiring relevant aviation industry participants to vary their Transport Security Programs. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">Under the current legislation, this is the only way the framework can address lasting threats such as those presented by the 2010 Yemen incident.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">While this mechanism has the desired security effect, it is cumbersome, and creates an excessive administrative burden, requiring each aircraft operator to manually amend its security program, and for the Government to individually assess each amendment.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">This Bill changes that by introducing a mechanism to quickly and efficiently respond to security threats on a national basis. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">The proposed changes allow the Government to prohibit all air cargo entering Australian territory, or be limited to a variety of types of cargo, depending on the nature of the threat. </span>

                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">Some of the current examples of the types of cargo that might be regulated are:</span>

                <p class="HPS-SmallBullet" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-SmallBullet">Cargo originating from a particular country or countries; or</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Small">This flexibility allows for currently unknown threats to be dealt with effectively and proportionately.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">The threat of improvised explosive devices concealed in air cargo is real and the consequence of such a plot succeeding would be catastrophic. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">As such, the Bill contains a strict liability offence.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">The Government believes this is an appropriate deterrent against acts or omissions committed by aviation industry participants that may contribute to the success of an attack.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">The penalties for an offence under the Bill are $34,000 for an aircraft operator and $17,000 for any other aviation industry participant.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">These penalties are consistent with similar existing penalties for strict liability offences within the Aviation Transport Security Act.  </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">Another consideration in developing the Bill is that lasting prohibitions on cargo have the potential to affect trade and foreign relations. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">This Bill addresses this by providing an appropriate level of scrutiny, transparency and accountability through the use of a disallowable instrument. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">No decision will be taken without consultation with the Minister for Foreign Affairs and the Trade Minister.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">The Bill makes a technical amendment to the Act which arose out of the Aviation Transport Security Amendment (Air Cargo) Act 2011.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">The Yemen incident has been a key driver for the strengthening of Australia’s air cargo security measures. </span>

                  <span class="HPS-Small">Ideally, all countries throughout the world would secure their own domestic and outbound cargo to a global minimum standard. </span>
                </p>

                  <span class="HPS-Small">However, as this goal remains aspirational, the Government must take steps to ensure it has the right tools to take action when needed to protect Australia’s interests. </span>

                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Australian Capital Territory</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">13:42</span>):  The opposition supports this legislation as part of the process of ensuring that Australian and global communities are confident in the operation of offshore petroleum assets, particularly in the oil and gas industry—a very important part of the Australian economy. Our gas exports at present come almost entirely from offshore petroleum in Western Australia, with some also from offshore petroleum in the waters north of Darwin. It has involved the introduction of the latest technology in the world, that of a floating LNG plant located aboard a ship which is larger than an aircraft carrier. It is imperative that Australia moves into the next phase of offshore petroleum production, liquids, condensate and oil, and also gas for the LNG plants to supply the Asian markets in particular. This legislation will ensure that those operations are done safely in an environmentally sustainable way. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The amendments introduce a number of important provisions, which are supported by the opposition. We believe the offshore oil and gas industry can operate in the manner which allows it to grow without exposing either the workers or the environment to unnecessary risks. We need to have the right legislation to ensure correct and safe operation, but the onus must be on the industry to go above and beyond the requirements of the legislation to do everything it can to ensure that the safety of its workers and the protection of the environment are paramount. Accordingly, I commend the bill to the Senate. </span>

                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Western Australia</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">13:44</span>):  The coalition does not like the Superannuation Legislation Amendment (Reform of Self Managed Superannuation Funds Supervisory Levy Arrangements) Bill 2013. What is described in Orwellian fashion as 'reform of self-managed superannuation' is, in fact, nothing but another Labor Party grab for cash. After five years of Labor's fiscal mismanagement, people across Australia are, every day, being asked to pay the price for the incompetence of our Treasurer, Mr Swan. But, given the circumstances we are in, given the fiscal mess Mr Swan has created, the coalition has no choice but not to oppose the bill.</span>

                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">First, it places new obligations on cargo terminal operators and people who load and unload cargo, which are similar to those that the Customs Act imposes on holders of depot and warehouse licences.  </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">

                  <span class="HPS-Small">Second, it creates new offences for obtaining and using restricted information, including information from the Integrated Cargo System, to commit an offence, and for unlawfully disclosing that restricted information.  The offences will be punishable by a maximum of 2 years imprisonment, a fine of up to 120 penalty units, or both.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">Third, it gives the Chief Executive Officer of Customs and Border Protection the power to impose new licence conditions at any time, and makes it an offence to breach certain licence conditions.  This brings the Customs broker licensing scheme into line with other customs licensing schemes. </span>

                  <span class="HPS-Small">Fourth, the bill amends the AusCheck Act 2007 to enable an ASIC or MSIC to be suspended if the cardholder has been charged with a serious offence.  </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">

                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">
                    <a href="KO6" type="MemberSpeech">
                      <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Senator HUMPHRIES</span>
                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Australian Capital Territory</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">13:47</span>):  The Customs and AusCheck Legislation Amendment (Organised Crime and Other Measures) Bill 2013 provides for two very different measures. The first measure seeks to implement recommendations made by Taskforce Polaris and the Parliamentary Joint Committee on Law Enforcement in their report on the adequacy of aviation and maritime security measures to combat serious and organised crime. The second measure removes the prohibition on the Deputy Speaker of the House of Representatives and the Deputy President of the Senate being members of the Parliamentary Joint Committee on the Australian Commission for Law Enforcement Integrity.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Before I address these measures in detail, I remind the Senate of the seriousness of the issue of organised criminal activity on Australian wharves and in our ports. Unfortunately, the Commonwealth's law enforcement agencies have been subject to systematic erosion in almost every budget since this government came to office. If the Attorney-General, the Minister for Home Affairs and the Labor Party were serious about stopping organised crime, that would be reflected in the allocation of resources and support for the essential elements of the mission of those agencies. It is an unfortunate fact that the budget cuts the government has inflicted on our law and border enforcement agencies have improved criminals' chances of putting guns and drugs into Australian communities. The government has reduced funding and personnel for law enforcement agencies such as the ACC and the AFP. It has also savaged Customs, the agency tasked with stopping illicit goods from coming across our borders.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Tuesday's budget confirmed what we already knew—that the government is simply not pulling its weight in this area. Further, it is being urged in that direction by the union movement. A group of five unions made a joint submission to the 2011 inquiry by the then Parliamentary Joint Committee on the Australian Crime Commission into aviation and maritime security measures. The five unions were the Maritime Union of Australia; the Australian Workers' Union; the Rail, Tram and Bus Union; the Australian Maritime Officers Union; and the International Transport Workers Union. The submission said:</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">Unions are unaware that the incidence of criminal activity is more prevalent on the Australian waterfront than in other domestic workplaces. We have seen and read divisive and scurrilous reports, including newspaper headlines about organised crime being rampant on our waterfront but the articles lack substance while the social commentators' arguments are hardly compelling.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">Both Australian Crime Commission maritime case studies included in their submission rely on allegations and suspicions. They suggest there is evidence of gangs of organised criminals operating and infiltrating the transport industries but the evidence is not included in the submission.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">These unions have collectively donated $23.7 million to the Labor Party since they came to office. The MUA in particular has long denied there is a problem with criminality on the waterfront. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The government has accordingly been extremely reluctant to act on criminality on the waterfront. The coalition, conversely, has consistently brought this issue to the attention of the government since 2009. This government has finally resolved to act at five minutes to midnight—or, more precisely, four years after these reports were brought to their attention—on the very eve of an election. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Under the Howard government, funding was increased for the AFP and there was an increase in staff numbers from around 2,000 to more than 6,000. By contrast, the last three Labor budgets, including the one delivered on Tuesday, have axed an astonishing $309.7 million from AFP funding. In the 2012-13 budget, to help prop up its budgetary position, Labor froze the use of $58.3 million taken directly from criminals under the Proceeds of Crime Act. Before the 2007 election, Labor promised to increase AFP ranks by 500 operational AFP officers over five years from January 2008. This commitment has not been met. AFP numbers have not been boosted in real terms and there have been at least 249 AFP redundancies since Labor came to office. On Tuesday, the Treasurer informed the nation that its 2007 commitment would be deferred yet again. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We have heard anecdotal reports of various branches within the AFP being forced to find ways to make more cuts, even though there is no more meat on the bone. The coalition has heard that crime scene investigators are being asked to bring their own notepads and pens to take notes at crime scenes. This is a sorry state of affairs for an agency that was properly resourced under the Howard government. It is particularly galling in an environment where government spending has increased so dramatically over the last five years.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Organised crime is a problem all across the country. Even regional centres and remote communities are not immune from the activities of organised criminal syndicates. The task of combating it requires resources, expertise and cooperation, yet the Australian Crime Commission has been systematically undermined by the Labor government. Tuesday's budget revealed that, since this government came to office, it has cut $29.08 million from the ACC's budget and 198 staff, over 40 per cent of its personnel. Taking the fight to organised crime cannot be achieved when our most powerful crime-fighting agency is being systematically downsized and sidetracked from the main game.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The Australian Customs and Border Protection Service is an important partner of front-line law enforcement agencies. It has a vital role of stopping illegal goods such as drugs and guns, but Customs is not able to perform that role at peak efficiency. The service is plagued by instances of corruption and cuts to the Customs cargo-screening process to the tune of $58 million. It has become clear that organised criminal syndicates are taking advantage of these conditions. The government simply does not subscribe to the tenet of a strong law enforcement regime and strong border protection system.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This bill amends the Customs Act in a number of ways which I will not detain the Senate with. It also amends the AusCheck Act 2007 to allow a person's ASIC or MSIC, or their application for such a card, to be suspended if the person has been charged with a serious offence, and it enables the AusCheck scheme to make provisions for background checks to determine whether an individual has been charged with a serious offence or whether a charge of a serious offence has been resolved in relation to the individual. And I have mentioned that the Deputy Speaker and the Deputy President will legally become members of the parliamentary joint committee. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">In conclusion, it is unfortunate that the process of implementing these measures has taken so long, particularly given the report that the joint committee on the Australian Crime Commission released in June 2011 and the recommendations that Taskforce Polaris handed down over a year ago. If the Attorney-General and the Minister for Home Affairs were serious about tackling organised criminal activity, they would have sought to protect their agencies from the damaging cuts this government has inflicted on them, particularly the cuts revealed by the Treasurer this week. Despite the failure of this government to protect the very agencies that this bill affects, the coalition does support measures to strengthen port and airport security, and for this reason I commend the bill to the Senate.</span>

                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Queensland</span>—<span class="HPS-MinisterialTitles">Leader of The Nationals in the Senate</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">13:55</span>):  It is amazing: a couple of days ago here, at about this time, Mr Duddy, one of Mr Windsor's supporters, came into the chamber and I gave a very short speech—three minutes—and we are still hearing the repercussions of it. It was quite clear at the time: I was pointing out that Mr Windsor did very well. This bill is to do with water. He was one of the architects of this. He sold his place for three times the price. I did not tell the full truth, because I said that he sold it for $2,000 an acre. He did not. It was nearly $5,000 an acre. That is an awful lot of money. I wondered how he could get such a price. But I went back and I had a look at some of the things he said in his letter to the editor about water, aquifers and mining. He said:</span>

                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">this is on the place he sold—</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">at some time in the future—that application may impact on "Cintra" land if approval were to be given.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Well, why else would you sell your property to a coalmining company unless you expected it to become a coalmine? And what else could affect an aquifer more than turning your place upside down? This is a place that your father owned, and I do not know how many generations the place has been in the family for. The letter also said:</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">This portion of coal bearing land on Windsor Family land is … gravel ridge …</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Small">A gravel ridge is the type of land that should be mined …</span>
                </p>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">That is what Mr Windsor said. Because he believes that that gravel ridge should be mined, maybe he believes that other gravel ridges should be mined. Maybe he believes that the ridges which he is currently protesting on should be mined. It just is a bit peculiar. How can you possibly have two different positions?</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I have to say that I think that he did an extremely good deal. It was probably just good luck—because most people would pay three times the price they have to! That is what you do—you just pay vastly more than you have to! That way, one person, one party, gets vastly more money than they expect—and we never know what the other party gets. Obviously they get the satisfaction of knowing that they bought it from you, and that is all that would be motivating them! That is it—just the satisfaction of knowing they paid three times too much for the asset they just purchased!</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This is a very interesting thing. Now we know that Mr Windsor does believe in mining. If you go out of Werris Creek, you can see his mine. It is a big mine, with bulldozers and draglines. It is a big mine—and this is the person who is the champion of aquifers—tearing up the coal so they can ship it off to China. This is the same person who apparently has got a problem with mining in other areas. But he did not have a problem just after he sold the place, back on 28 July 2010. At that time, his problem was not quite so acute, because he says:</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">A gravel ridge is the type of land that should be mined …</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">So he is a miner. Coalmine Tony—that is what we call him! 'If mining were to be approved?' Why else would you sell your place to a coalmine unless you thought it was going to be approved for coalmining? What else are they going to put on it—a golf course, a recreation area, a theme park? Why else would you sell your place to a coalmine unless you thought it was going to become a coalmine? </span>

I refer the minister to concerns reported today that the budget's assumptions about the value of the dollar and commodity prices might be overly optimistic and, if so, could lead to reduced revenue collections to the tune of $90 billion. Given the heroic assumptions in the budget about the terms of trade and the highly optimistic estimates about the revenue to be collected via the carbon price and the mining tax, will the minister, as one of the people most responsible for preparing the budget, accept a personal responsibility for any deterioration in revenue collections and any consequent impact on the deficit?</span>

The first is: notwithstanding the attempt by the coalition to distract attention by attacking the Treasury or attacking forecasts, I would remind the coalition that the very professional officers of the Treasury and the very professional officers of Finance are the same institutions—and, often, in many locations, the same individuals—who served Mr Costello and produced the forecasts for Mr Costello. But what the coalition would have you believe is that, magically, suddenly, the Treasury has become some hotbed of a Labor Party faction. Well, we on this side actually have some regard for the professionalism of the institution and think it is very unfair and inappropriate for the coalition to continue to attack the Treasury in the way that it is.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">I think there were two questions. The first might have been in relation to nominal GDP, and I would make the point that the forecasts for nominal GDP are in fact: nominal GDP growth below trend and well below the 20-year average, and in fact the nominal GDP forecast has been reduced since the midyear review. In terms of the terms of trade, the forecasts in the budget are broadly in line with those of many major forecasters and show a decline over the forecast period, and of course there is an assumption about decline over the projection period.</span>

But we know that that is the approach that the coalition take. I again remind the Senator that, in terms of the forecasters, the Treasury also forecast for Mr Costello and he is now attacking the same institution that served very well under both governments. I would remind him also of some comments by market economists: according to Citi, the economic forecasts look achievable and are similar to the RBA's, and our forecasts, according to UBS— <span style="font-style:italic;">(Time expired)</span></span>

Given that, in the minister's time as finance minister, we have seen the cumulative total of deficits run up to over $40 billion—more than you and the Treasurer estimated at budget time; $40 billion over what they told us it was going to be—why should Australians have any confidence in your estimates? Why should we have any confidence in the next budget nightmare, the NBN? Is it the fact that Mr Swan just cannot help himself, grossly overestimating your ability to keep the nation's finances under proper control? <span style="font-style:italic;">(Time expired)</span></span>

The fact of the matter is that real funding per student has increased under the Labor government and will continue to increase after the efficiency dividend has been taken into account. In 2007, real funding per student was $16,147. In 2012, it was $17,659. With the efficiency dividend taken into account, real funding—this is after you have taken out inflation—per student is projected to exceed $18,000 in 2017. This will be a real funding increase in excess of 10 per cent. The suggestion that you should only look at one funding source is fanciful and is out of touch with reality. <span style="font-style:italic;">(Time expired)</span></span>

Only two months ago the then Minister for Tertiary Education, Skills, Science and Research, Mr Bowen, said that 'universities are entitled to assume they will be at grave risk under a Liberal government' and that 'the sector is entitled to conclude that university funding will be a prime target' for the coalition. Will the minister now apologise to Australian universities for running a cynical scare campaign in preparation for its own recent $2.3 billion cuts?</span>

Minister, are you aware of the Rajapaksa government's compulsory acquisition of Tamil land in Sri Lanka, and in particular of the petition lodged in the appeals court against the latest proposed land acquisition, P1, which seeks to appropriate 6,381 acres of land for government forces for no public purpose, land which contains the traditional homes of Tamils who have been kept in camps and repeatedly refused permission to return? If so, what representations have you made to the Rajapaksa government regarding such land acquisitions, displacement of people and fuelling of people seeking asylum? If you have not made representations, why not, and will you do so?</span>

I thank the minister for getting advice on the land acquisition policies. I ask: given the impeachment of the Chief Justice of Sri Lanka because she stalled legislation that sought to grant greater political and financial power to President Rajapaksa's younger brother, the economic development minister, is the Australian government confident of the independence of the judiciary in Sri Lanka or that the rule of law is being upheld in Sri Lanka or, indeed, will be upheld in the appeals court, where this petition on land grabbing is being held? If you are confident, why have you got that confidence? <span style="font-style:italic;&#xD;&#xA;    font-size:12pt;&#xD;&#xA;  ">(Time expired)</span></span>

I am not in a position to do that. If there are matters of concern to us, we will raise them with the government. I raised with Foreign Minister Peiris our concern at the dismissal of the Chief Justice of Sri Lanka. I did that with a phone call to him rather than a public statement. I raised as well the question of judicial independence when I was in Colombo in December. The government presented an explanation of its criticisms of members of the judicial system. But it is not up to us to make a determination. We make representations. Sri Lanka will have to answer in various international fora, like before the Human Rights Council resolution, initiated with our support and our co-sponsorship, and answer to its own people.

                  </a>  I would make a couple of points in response to the question. The first is that, whatever criticisms the senator has of the MRRT, the revenue write-downs that are being seen in the federal budget are far bigger than what we see in the context of the MRRT. In other words, the write-down on the MRRT revenue is a fraction of the total write-down that the government has confronted in putting this budget together—a fraction of the total write-down. I would remind the senator: it is true that the MRRT has been written down, but it is also true that you see, in aggregate, much bigger write-downs from other profit based taxes across the board. So the fiction that Senator Cormann continues in this question is that, if there were a different MRRT, the budget position somehow would change. The reality is that the revenue write down from the MRRT is only a fraction of the $60 billion that confronts whoever is working on the budget. They would be the same figures if Senator Cormann were in government.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">In terms of the MRRT, the budget makes clear that the revised projections are for a net of $5.5 billion over the new forward estimates. Obviously, resource rent taxes are, by their nature, difficult to forecast. Some volatility in revenue relative to the estimates is to be expected. I would make the point that Treasury's outlook is consistent with forecasts by the independent Parliamentary Budget Office, as well as market economists like Deloitte Access Economics.</span>

Obviously, the volatility of resource rent taxes is an intrinsic aspect of their design. The PRRT is also a profits based tax. It has been around for about 25 years. The volatility of collections under that revenue head exceeds that of any other revenue head.</span>

                  </a>  It is good news. We have also committed more in public transportation infrastructure than all of our predecessors since Federation combined. In five short years, Labor has turned around declining investment in the nation's infrastructure and begun building for the future. We have replaced the neglect, buck-passing and short-termism by the Liberals and Nationals with a comprehensive national plan—unlike what the Liberals have demonstrated. That is why, in this budget, the federal Labor government is injecting a further $24 billion into our Nation Building Program. This takes our investment in the nation's road, rail and urban public transport to a record $60 billion over the 11 years to 2018-19. But the job is not finished there; there is more to be done.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">This year's budget will get the missing link between the F3 and M2 in Sydney to market within months. We will assist the New South Wales government to deliver the M4 and M5 extension, in partnership with the private sector. In Brisbane, in my home city, Labor will upgrade and widen the Gateway Motorway to six lanes between Nudgee Road and the Deagon Deviation. In Melbourne, we are investing to widen the M80 to a minimum of three lanes, in both directions, and to install the latest technology for managing traffic flows along the entire corridor. In Adelaide, we will upgrade and widen South Road between Torrens Road and the River Torrens. In Perth, we will see the construction of the Swan Valley bypass, which will replace the Great Northern Highway as the main freight route for going in and out of the city from the north.

Labor's investment in Australia's vital infrastructure extends beyond the limits of the cities—where the Liberals stopped. In fact, two-thirds of our infrastructure budget will be for projects in rural and regional Australia. The 2013-14 budget builds on what is already the largest road construction project since the creation of the National Highway Network some 40 years ago. This budget locks in the funding for Labor's $4.1 billion plan for a better and safer Bruce Highway to begin; it will continue and complete a range of improvements to this vital road. It continues the substantial progress towards the full duplication of the Pacific Highway. I add that that is one of the largest and most complex road construction projects ever undertaken in this country. It delivers a dedicated package of works along the Midland Highway in Tasmania. All of this is about supporting— <span style="font-style:italic;">(Time expired)</span></span>

Investing in roads and rail increases productivity, reduces congestion and increases time spent at home. I heard some little laughs from the opposition during the last question—very concerning from the doormats to the Liberal Party. The Liberals and Nationals only know one thing when it comes to investing in the nation's infrastructure: neglect, neglect and neglect. Quite frankly, they are not up to the job of investing in nation-building projects about relieving congestion and ensuring that we have good-quality roads and highways. After 12 years of the Howard government, a lack of investment cut almost one percentage point off annual growth and more than $2 billion was slashed from the federal roads budget atop the slashing of the $1 billion from the health budget. Australia ranked 20th out of the 25 OECD countries when it came to investing in public infrastructure— <span style="font-style:italic;">(Time expired)</span></span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Queensland</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">14:38</span>):  My question is about a catastrophic animal welfare issue and it is to the Minister for Agriculture, Fisheries and Forestry. I ask Senator Ludwig: as agriculture minister and as a Queenslander, what submissions did he make to the Minister for Sustainability, Environment, Water, Population and Communities, Tony Burke, for permission to allow grazing on national parks for the up to 300,000 head of cattle that are at risk of a horrible death from starvation as a result of the live cattle ban, bushfires and drought? Does the minister agree with the Queensland RSPCA, which said that the Queensland government's decision to allow access to national parks was 'a common-sense solution to a potentially catastrophic animal welfare event'?</span>

This form of land tenure offers real protection to threatened ecosystems and species. But any decision to open them up for grazing, even where this was the former principal land use, needs to be carefully considered by all parties. While the management of national parks in Queensland lies within the responsibility of the state government, many parks have been established to protect matters of national environmental significance. Under the Commonwealth Environment Protection and Biodiversity Conservation Act, actions that have actual environmental significance—</span>

If the Queensland government and Senator Macdonald cared about graziers in the Richmond area and those northern areas, they would have already signed up to Farm Finance, which we announced in the budget. I have asked them to, but I have not heard a peep out of Senator Macdonald on this issue. I have not heard a peep, not about providing assistance to graziers. All he wants to talk about are issues that do not actually concern the department. This is about the EPBC Act. What he wants to do is to go off on a frolic of his own across into grasslands, but let me say that if you want to provide real help to farmers and if you want to support farming communities, why don't you make representations to the Campbell Newman government about supporting farm finance and ensuring that we do get real outcomes for farmers in those regions? We can provide them with up to $650,000 loans; we can provide them with debt mediation legislation— <span style="font-style:italic;">(Time expired)</span></span>

In addition to that, to deal with some of the head winds, we put together a farm finance package. So, if Senator Macdonald does want to provide assistance and does want to put his shoulder to the wheel to help some of those producers do some of that work—quite frankly I doubt that is his real intent in any event—he can encourage Minister McVeigh and the Campbell Newman government to sign up to farm finance. That will— <span style="font-style:italic;">(Time expired)</span></span>

The allegation is wrong; it is based on fallacious propaganda. Not even proponents of Papuan independence subscribe to this view. The Australian government agrees with the Indonesian president, President Yudhoyono, that full implementation of special autonomy is the best way to deliver durable peace and security for the people of Papua. Australia recognises the territorial integrity of Indonesia through the 2006 Lombok Treaty. We do not see special autonomy as a step towards Papuan independence. </span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">Contrary to Senator Madigan's allegations, Australians should all be proud that our aid to Indonesia is improving school quality by building 2,000 junior secondary schools, training midwives so that more than 40,000 births can be attended and delivering an extra 9,000 sewerage connections in communities without access to water or sanitation. This aid will establish 300,000 new secondary school enrolments by 2016. Some 20,000 people in Papua and West Papua will receive HIV treatment through our aid program. Even Senator Madigan should acknowledge that the quickest way out of poverty is access to education and good health services. Let me be very clear: the Australian position, under governments of different persuasion, has been that Indonesian sovereignty in the provinces of West Papua is absolute and uncontested, and only reckless Australians would argue for any other proposition. Only reckless, unthinking Australians would defy this country's national interests and urge the dismemberment of Indonesia. That is an appalling thing to do. It takes no account of this country's interests or of the interests and welfare of the people of Indonesia or of those in Papua.</span>

We have no evidence of that. That is the first point I want to make and underline. I am advised that none of the Australian C130 aircraft have been delivered to Indonesia yet. Through the Defence Cooperation Program with Indonesia, Australia has agreed to provide up to four of them. The contribution was to support humanitarian assistance and disaster relief operations so that Indonesia could respond better to natural disasters. None of the Australian C130 aircraft have been delivered yet. One of the aircraft is being repaired, but delivery to Indonesia is some time off. The suggestion that there were forced removals of West Papuan people has never been established.</span>

We have not seen evidence of it. Our embassy in Jakarta takes a keen interest in all human rights questions that arise out of Papua. It takes a keen interest and investigates them. We maintain a dialogue with Indonesia about this. In my meetings with the Indonesians—with the President, with the Foreign Minister—our Indonesian interlocutors have raised the matter of Papua before I have been able to get to it. The President has underlined his commitment to special autonomy, and we agree with his interpretation that economic growth, the achievement of prosperity, is the best path forward—linked to special autonomy—for the people of those two provinces.</span>

Minister, late last week, a 'Save SPC' community rally was held in Shepparton, Victoria, bringing together the AMWU, community members and over a hundred local fruit growers. As you would be aware, the Goulburn Valley's largest fruit-packing company, SPC Ardmona, announced a massive 50 per cent cutback in food processing. This is the latest in a string of similar disasters for the Australian food processing industry, an industry that has suffered 12 straight months of contraction. Over 1,200 horticulture processing jobs have been lost, and 11 fruit and vegetable processors have been closed. Many of these jobs are in the Goulburn Valley, Victoria, with SPC's contribution to wages being close to $26 million within the local community alone. What action is the government taking to support local fruit growers and workers in this region?</span>

I might deal with the SPC Ardmona issue, seeing that it was raised. I am aware of the challenges in that region around Shepparton. But the high Australian dollar is and has been presenting difficulties for our agricultural industry, including the specific ones faced by individual processors such as SPC Ardmona. SPC Ardmona have written to the Prime Minister requesting that the government impose safeguard measures in the form of increased tariffs. That is dealing with the processor and that is a matter that will fall, ultimately, within another portfolio area for determination.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">In terms of helping, in particular, farming communities in those regions, the greatest help that can be provided very quickly on the ground is the Farm Finance package—and I would like to hear from those opposite how much effort they are making to encourage the Victorian and New South Wales governments to support the Farm Finance package, because it will allow for diversification and consolidation. It will allow those people who want to choose different opportunities to use up to $650,000 worth of concessional loans to provide the support and assistance they need so much. Certainly, in the travels I have undertaken in those areas, people say that concessional loans of that nature will allow them to continue to pursue other opportunities in those regions, because they are good, fertile areas and they have opportunity with both land and water. In this instance, they are flying into some pretty tough headwinds. That is certainly acknowledged in those regions.

On the basis of that review, I have referred the matter—as I think I said earlier; Senator McKenzie might listen to my earlier answer—to the Minister for Trade, the Hon. Dr Craig Emerson. I understand it is a matter for Dr Emerson to consider, and I have responded to SPC Ardmona in those terms. I will not be so bold as Senator Macdonald and seek to table the letter or claim that SPC Ardmona have already received the letter. I will check to make sure that has been done. Senator McKenzie might do the same, and check with SPC Ardmona today whether or not they have received a letter, so that her information is up to date. <span style="font-style:italic;">(Time expired)</span></span>

We do have within DAFF a very strong biosecurity section but ultimately biosecurity for domestic issues, as Senator McKenzie should know, does fall within state responsibility. I can say, with some encouragement, that we do have a framework in place that the state and territory ministers signed off at the last COAG meeting. Why? Because it is incredibly important that we do deal broadly with biosecurity issues such as those involved in pre-border, border and post-border incursions. </span>

From 1 July 2012 to today, 16 May, Defence has received a total of 664 questions. All 253 Senate questions except for 12 have been answered; all 95 House of Representatives questions have been answered; and 213 committee questions have been answered of 316 asked. </span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">The government and Defence continue to respond to large numbers of questions on notice from parliament and its committees. Many of the questions asked relate to complex and highly technical defence capability management issues. Accordingly, the effort required to address a number of these questions is significant. While it is important to ensure that answers to these complex and technical questions are correct, I recognise that there is room for improvement in relation to time lines for Defence's responses. Defence will continue to work to deliver more timely responses to questions on notice.</span>

              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Small">That the Senate take note of the answers given by the Minister for Agriculture, Fisheries and Forestry (Senator Ludwig) and the Minister for Science and Research (Senator Farrell) to questions without notice asked by Opposition senators today.</span>
              </p>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">Contrary to the slur on me by the Minister for Agriculture, Fisheries and Forestry, which was not corrected by the President, that I had got the letter and had not passed it on, the letter I was quoting from, from the Minister for National Parks, Recreation, Sport and Racing in Queensland, the Hon. Steve Dickson, was sent directly not only to Mr Burke but also to Senator Ludwig. Those letters were written on Tuesday, and they were also posted on Tuesday. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">That does not get to the substantive issue, which is: why is the Gillard government more interested in growing grass than in the fate of 300,000 live animals? You hear the Greens and the Labor Party carrying on about cruelty to animals—here is cruelty on an unprecedented scale: 300,000 cattle are about to die for reasons of natural calamity, drought, bushfire and the stupid decision of the Gillard government some time ago to ban live cattle exports without any warning.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Forget about relief to farmers, important though that is. It is important, and the Queensland government will be doing what it can to help, but that is another question and I do not want to get distracted. The rules about that, and what relief will do, really will not help the landowners and they certainly will not help the fate of 300,000 live animals. Where are the Greens? I do not even see them in the chamber. I would have thought they would be jumping up and down on their Senate desks asking what the government is doing about the fate of these 300,000 animals that are going to die not a death from having a leg broken or being mistreated for five minutes but a lingering, horrible death from starvation.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The Queensland government—applauded, I might say, by the Queensland RSPCA—has a practical and sensible solution. Their plan is to put these cattle into areas that only recently were locked up by the previous Queensland government and the Gillard government as part of the nature reserve system. They have grass in them and they are in proximity to the areas that have been drought declared. They are suitable for the agistment of cattle. So there is a solution at hand—an easy solution. Sure, we want to preserve in Australia what we need to preserve, and that can be done. But carefully moving these cattle into national reserve systems can save them, and that will help with the financial and social welfare of the people who own those cattle and who are facing bankruptcy, loss of their homes, loss of their businesses and loss of their kids' schooling because of the live cattle ban, exacerbated by a following bushfire and then the drought.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Senator Ludwig says that he innocently misled the chamber, but he did not miss the opportunity of making some specious remark to me. As I say, I cannot understand why the President would pull me up for accusing Senator Ludwig of being a liar but not address his comment. But that is another issue.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Northern Territory</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">15:09</span>):  I rise to respond to taking note of answers this afternoon. I did think that, two days after handing down one of the most significant budgets in this country, we might have been taking note of the progress of this country and the two major reforms we announced on Tuesday night. Let me take this opportunity to put some facts on the record about grazing cattle in Queensland national parks. Unlike you, Senator Macdonald, I do not have the privilege of any letter from Minister Ludwig or the Queensland government, but I do have a bit of background on this issue. Perhaps for the next couple of minutes we could very quietly and carefully put some facts down.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">We know that there has been a call for national parks in Queensland to be used to graze drought-affected cattle. There has been the article in the <span style="font-style:italic;">Australian </span>claiming that our environment minister, Mr Tony Burke, has rejected a plan to let starving cattle loose in conservation reserves and national parks in Queensland. Apparently the article says that that has infuriated the state government and drought-hit graziers. Mr Tony Burke is a former agriculture minister; obviously he makes those statements with some background from his former portfolio. I am led to believe that he has told the <span style="font-style:italic;">Australian</span> that he did not have an interest in helping to wreck the states conservation areas. I have to say that Australia's and Queensland's national parks were established for very good reasons. This form of tenure offers real protection, not to grazing drought-affected cattle but to protect threatened ecosystems and species. So any decision to—</span>

Senator Macdonald, if you want to ask questions about pig shooting and starving cattle, I might be able to help you. Lately in the Northern Territory we have had the issue of starving horses. I am giving it my best shot here, seeing that I would really like to have talked about the budget and given that I really want to know whether Mr Abbott this evening is going to commit to the $70 million we have committed to build the hospital at Palmerston in the Northern Territory and the $38 million for a new paediatric ward. That is the crucial issue on my mind today.</span>

                  <span style="font-style:italic;" />As you can well imagine, I am trying to establish the very fine line between protecting national parks and assisting farmers in Queensland, even though they may have 300,000 starving head of cattle. The administration of the EPBC Act is a matter for my colleague Minister Burke and I am advised that he is yet to receive a proposal from the Queensland government. I understand Mr Burke has been clear that national parks should be there for people to enjoy nature and not for cattle grazing. So we have announced the Farm Finance package. We are trying to support Australian farmers and graziers who face enormous challenges, including producers in Queensland. We want to ensure that farmers are equipped to deal with all of the differences they face in the climate, rather than to look for an ad hoc solution to open up a national park in a conservation area. As I said, we announced a national drought reform measure in the budget and that is the Farm Finance package. That is the way to resolve this issue—to support those producers. <span style="font-style:italic;">(Time expired)</span></span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Queensland</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">15:14</span>):  What has characterised this government from the word go, going right back to 2007, is the great chasm between its rhetoric—its sparkling rhetoric at times—and its policy implementation. That has been the problem of this government since the beginning. It is always overpromising and it is always underdelivering. Someone else—and it will be a coalition government—will, in the end, have to pick up the pieces. When you go back, it does not matter whether you look at computers in schools, pink batts, overpriced school halls or any of the rest of it—today it is about the NBN—it is the same thing. There is always sparkling rhetoric and there is always underdelivery, tomorrow's headlines being more important than tomorrow's outcomes and tomorrow's achievements. It is spin over substance.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I have always accepted that the Prime Minister, Senator Kim Carr and Senator Chris Evans are genuinely concerned about education, higher education in particular. I accept that they all believe that it is transformative and that they take it very seriously. I have always believed that. But, if you make promises, you must properly fund them; otherwise, it is just empty rhetoric. If you come forward with a profound policy change—and uncapping the number of undergraduate places at Australian universities is a significant policy change—you must adequately fund those places. If you do not, it is merely empty rhetoric and you are leading undergraduate students along a rocky path. They are not being properly resourced. I accept that it is important we encourage kids from disadvantaged backgrounds, kids from rural and regional areas and Aboriginal kids to go to university—but only if the project is properly resourced and quality and standards are maintained. </span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">In my question today to Senator Farrell, I argued implicitly that funding per student had fallen. I draw the chamber's attention to a publication put out by Universities Australia, <span style="font-style:italic;">A smarter Australia: policy advice for an incoming government</span>. On the final page it says:</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Small">Despite recent, significant, and much-welcomed increases, base funding per student has fallen in real terms from 2008 to 2013 by 1.6 per cent, and has fallen 22 per cent since 1995. Without arresting this decline, Australia will continue to fall behind.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">That 1.6 per cent fall in real terms was before this budget. This budget cuts funding to higher education across the board by five per cent.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">This is the problem. If you want to uncap the system and let many more students come in, you must adequately fund it. It is the worst possible outcome to have kids who are less academically prepared and then to fund the system inadequately. In fact, you really need to do the opposite. What is happening today is that more young Australians who are less academically prepared are going to university, putting far greater stress on the system. You must adequately resource that system; otherwise, what happens? The quality and the standards in our Australian universities fall. I know that every senator in this chamber shares the view that our universities are essential not only as a source of productivity and innovation—key contributors to our economy—but as Australia's largest services export industry. Brand Australia cannot suffer a decline in standards and quality. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">What worries me about the current government's approach is this: if you continue to allow more and more students in and funding declines per student, you will have a decline in quality and standards. That might cause the export industry to decline. That is bad enough, that exports are compromised, but worse is that those students—students the government, Australia, has encouraged to go to university—will not be properly serviced. In the end, it is not only bad economically—although that is bad enough—but very bad socially. Our students deserve much better.</span>

                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Senator THISTLETHWAITE</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">New South Wales</span>—<span class="HPS-MinisterialTitles">Parliamentary Secretary for Pacific Island Affairs and Parliamentary Secretary for Multicultural Affairs</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">15:20</span>):  I am pleased that Senator Mason has raised the issue of higher education, animated as his contribution was. When it comes to education there are clear and stark differences between the approach of the Gillard government and that of the opposition. The stark differences are best underlined by the following anecdote.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Last year, I had the good fortune to visit Mungindi, a town on the border between Queensland and New South Wales. I was up there to open their brand-new trade training centre, a $2.5 million investment by the Gillard government in an education pathway for students at Mungindi Central School. Mungindi is a town with deep social problems. It has a very large Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander population.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">At the conclusion of the ceremony to open the trade training centre—the centre will provide hospitality trade training and metalwork trade training—I was talking to a young Indigenous girl. She was telling me how excited she was about the prospect of becoming a chef. She had finally decided what she wanted to do in life and she was now working hard to become a chef—this was a young girl in year 10. The school had built a vegetable patch out the back of the school, so they were not only teaching the students to cook but teaching them how to cook healthy food. This young Indigenous girl, this year 10 student, was telling me that she now goes home and teaches her mother how to cook healthy food. She was telling me that her mother had never been taught how to cook healthy food. It was not the way that they did things in her family. That is real social change, brought about by this government's investment in vocational education and training in schools for those people who may not be academically minded, providing them with an opportunity to aspire to a form of education that is suitable to their circumstances.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">What people have to understand is that the Leader of the Opposition and the Liberal Party, those opposite, have announced that they will cancel the Trade Training Centres in Schools Program should they come to office. They will cancel that program that has been so innovative and has been providing opportunities for young people, like that young Indigenous girl from Mungindi that I spoke to, to get a better education. That is the difference between Labor and the opposition when it comes to education. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We know that we have a problem with school education in this country. The results demonstrate that Australian students' performance is slipping down the scales internationally when we are compared to other nations. We are slipping as a nation. So we as a government determined that we would deal with this, and we asked the Gonski panel to consult widely on this issue and come up with a set of recommendations. They did. They consulted throughout the country, with academics, with principals, with teachers, with parents and with students, and they developed a new model for funding education in this country. Labor is delivering that model, and we wait to hear, hopefully tonight, what the opposition will say in respect of funding decent education in this country.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">
                  <span style="font-style:italic;" />Senator Mason raised the point of university education, and I am glad he did, because this Labor government has done more to advance university education and, importantly, the accessibility of university education for students from all backgrounds throughout this country than any other government in this nation's history. We have grown university funding by close to 60 per cent. Through the Commonwealth Grant Scheme, funding for universities has increased from $3.5 billion in 2007 to $5.8 billion in 2010, a 66 per cent increase. We have uncapped university places, so there are now around 150,000 extra students attending university throughout Australia because of the changes that this government made. And we introduced a more generous rate of indexation for higher education funding in 2012, resulting in indexation growth of 3.8 per cent in 2012 and 3.9 per cent in 2013. That is this government's commitment to funding education at all levels within our society. <span style="font-style:italic;">(Time expired) </span></span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">
                  <a href="xt4" type="MemberSpeech">
                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Senator RONALDSON</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Victoria</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">15:25</span>):  I rise this afternoon to refer to a press release put out by Catherine King, the member for Ballarat in the other place. With great fanfare on Tuesday night, Ms King announced that the budget provided $9.1 million for the Ballarat freight hub. The press release said:</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Small">The Federal Budget delivered tonight includes funding of $9.1 million towards Stage 1 …</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Then Ms King yesterday said: 'Under this Labor government, the funding is on the table. It is there this financial year.' And on radio 3BA yesterday, I understand, Ms King said: 'The Ballarat freight hub to come into effect next year, which is, you know, only a short, you know—we're almost halfway through the year now, so it's to come into effect next year; in other words, in seven months time.'</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">So what actually was put into the budget, do you think, Mr Deputy President? What I can tell the chamber is that there is no funding this year for the hub. We know there is no funding. As John Fitzgibbon, the Liberal Party candidate for Ballarat, said, this is an important project, but what Mr Fitzgibbon said, and what I say, is that the minister responsible was being completely untruthful when she said that this would be funded this year. It was an untruth. It is no secret that Ms King is joined at the hip with the Treasurer, Wayne Swan, and with the Prime Minister, Julia Gillard. As we know, she was given an eleventh-hour job because of her support for Ms Gillard. But the reason that she is joined at the hip is that she suffers from the same malaise as the Prime Minister and Mr Swan, and that malaise is: all spin and no substance.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">In the time left to me, I will briefly go through the budget papers so that the utter fallacy of Ms King's press release can be seen by all who would like to have a look at it. What Ms King's own department said is this:</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Small">Accordingly, after consulting with the State Government and Infrastructure Australia , we are now in a position to release a preliminary schedule of new projects to be funded and delivered over the five year life of our next Nation Building Program (2014-15 to 2018-19). </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">There was no funding allocated for this precinct, for this hub, in this year's budget. The very best that Ms King, if she were being truthful about this, could have said was that, if this second Nation Building Program money is funded in next year's budget, then there may be funding allocated between 2014-15 and possibly as late as 2018-19—not in this financial year. It was a complete untruth, a deliberate attempt by Ms King to get herself elected, when everyone knows that Ms Catherine King is now Canberra's representative in Ballarat and she is no longer Ballarat's representative in Canberra. Ms King has abrogated her responsibility to the people of the Ballarat electorate. Fortunately, we have someone there by the name of John Fitzgibbon, the Liberal Party candidate, ready, willing and able to stand up and start representing his community. If Ms King thinks she can get re-elected on the back of a complete untruth about a so-called budget measure, then, quite frankly, I think she is sadly mistaken.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I also want to speak about another broken promise of this government. The member for Eden-Monaro, Dr Michael Kelly—I think he goes by the title of 'Dr' these days—has been running around with the military superannuants for about four weeks before the budget, saying, 'Listen—don't talk about it; I'm going to get this fixed. I'll get this fixed.' Do you think this budget had anything in there for the fair indexation of DFRDB and DFRB military superannuants? No, they did not. So Mr Kelly from the other place— <span style="font-style:italic;">(Time expired)</span></span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">We are, in Australia, having a number of people from Sri Lanka seeking asylum, and the Australian government, together with the coalition, are turning them back and sending them away, and there is very little analysis of what is actually going on and the human rights abuses that are taking place in Sri Lanka right now. Of course there were atrocities during the civil war and there deserves to be an international and thorough inquiry into those atrocities. But the pretence of this government seems to be that those atrocities are over. Well, we know they are not. The UN High Commissioner for Human Rights, Navi Pillay, has reported just this year on extrajudicial killings, enforced disappearances, militarisation and land grabs, and it is one of those land grabs that Senator Carr seemed to know nothing about.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Let me tell you, Mr Deputy President, that in the appeals court in Sri Lanka there has been a petition filed against an acquisition notice marked 'P1' that advocates the appropriation of 6,381 acres of Tamil land that contains their traditional homes. The petition is against the government compulsorily acquiring land to be taken over by government forces for no public purpose. In other words, people are being displaced, driven off their land, by the Rajapaksa regime. A petition is going to the appeals court. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">But there is no rule of law in Sri Lanka anymore. There is no independence of the judiciary. The chief justice was impeached only recently because she stalled through the courts a move by the Rajapaksa regime to extend the powers of the President's younger brother, who happens to be the Minister for Economic Development in that country. We are seeing academics disappear in white vans. People are pulled off the street and shoved into white vans without numberplates. They disappear. They are tortured. Many do not return. Several are just dumped back on the streets after they have been tortured. This is going on right now. That is why people in that country are trying to get away and seek asylum. If they had been—and they were—displaced after the civil war, they were sent to camps. While they are in camps they are not allowed to go back to their traditional lands, and in move the Rajapaksas, acquire that land and take it from them, or, alternatively, dump people back on land that has been totally destroyed without any infrastructure. That is what is going on.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Other countries around the world are really concerned about this, and the minister acknowledged that Australia co-sponsored a motion in Geneva at the Human Rights Council—after Australia worked with other countries to water it down, I might say, but at least it went through; we got that petition through. Yet the minister says he can believe the Rajapaksa regime, that he works cooperatively with the Rajapaksa regime, and that Australia is going to go to CHOGM. Australia should stay away from the Commonwealth Heads of Government Meeting as the Canadians are going to do, because by going there you are legitimising the human rights abuses and the land grabs going on in Sri Lanka right at this time, which are displacing people and leaving them with nowhere to go. I would ask that the Australian government seriously look at what happens to this petition in the appeal court against compulsory acquisition of land. This is an area two-thirds the size of Colombo that is currently being compulsorily acquired and taken away from its rightful owners.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Just here this morning we had the government and coalition get together to excise the whole country of Australia from the migration zone to stop people from Sri Lanka trying to seek asylum because a number of them arrived in a boat at Geraldton, and they have been sent back with virtually no proper assessment of their asylum-seeking claims and rights. That is the sort of country we have turned into, and we are supporting the Rajapaksas. As one of the members of the House of Commons asked of the government in the UK recently: are you happy for the person who is going to chair the Commonwealth meeting in Sri Lanka to be a person who is accused of war crimes? Is that a particularly good idea? It is absolutely appalling that we are not taking a stand against the Rajapaksas and instead are pouring money into the Rajapaksa regime and turning a blind eye to what is going on. The test of this will be: what does the government do in relation to this particular petition in the appeals court against compulsory acquisitions?</span>

                <span class="HPS-Small">On 25 November 2011, the Senate referred the Crimes Amendment (Fairness for Minors) Bill 2011 to the Legal and Constitutional Affairs Committee for inquiry and report. The Committee held a public hearing on 16 March 2012, and released its report on 4 April 2012, with four recommendations. Senator Sarah Hanson-Young prepared a dissenting report, with three recommendations.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Small">The Australian Government Attorney-General's Department (AGD), in collaboration with the Commonwealth Director of Public Prosecutions (CDPP) and the Australian Federal Police (AFP), made a joint submission to the inquiry (the Commonwealth submission). Commonwealth officers also gave evidence at the Committee hearing.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Small">The Commonwealth's submission recommended that the Senate should not pass the Bill. In summary, Commonwealth agencies considered the Bill's proposal to impose strict timeframes for age determination and laying charges would not be practical or achievable. The limitations on laying charges would also be inconsistent with section 15B(1)(a) of the <span style="font-style:italic;">Crimes Act 1914</span>, which permits the Commonwealth to commence prosecutions for serious Commonwealth offences at any time.</span>
              </p>

                <span class="HPS-Small">Further, Commonwealth agencies considered the proposed presumption of age and associated detention arrangements would jeopardise the Commonwealth's ability to flexibly manage detainees on a case-by-case basis, taking into account a range of factors in accordance with 'the best interests of the child' principle under the United Nations' <span style="font-style:italic;">Convention on the Rights of the Child</span>.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Small">The AFP has worked hard to reduce the amount of time taken to investigate people smuggling offences and prepare a brief of evidence, setting a benchmark of 90 days to lay charges.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Small">
                  <span style="color:gray;text-decoration:none underline;">As a result of continuing efforts to reduce time in detention, the AFP advises that for the period from 1 January 2012 to 12 November 2012, the average period of investigation from the date of formal referral of crew by DIAC to the date of charging by the AFP is 74 days</span>.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Small">The Government is committed to further reducing delays in the investigation and prosecution of people smuggling offences. Commonwealth agencies are developing solutions to address delays, including obtaining identity documents from Indonesian consular officials in the first instance, pending a mutual assistance request. These documents may then inform the AFP's decision about whether to give a person the benefit of the doubt about their age, prior to laying charges.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Small">Unfortunately, there are often delays to the investigation process caused by environmental factors, which are difficult to avoid. For example, weather conditions may cause delays in conveying items of evidence, such as mobile phones and GPS equipment, which require forensic analysis by experts and equipment on mainland Australia. There may also be delays in securing interpreters of specific dialects required for interviews or investigations.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Small">In addition, passengers on board people smuggling vessels are sometimes initially unable or unwilling to provide statements, which are necessary to proceed with most people smuggling prosecutions.</span>

                  <span style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;color:gray;">The committee recommends that the Australian Government introduce legislation to expressly provide that, where a person raises the issue of age during criminal proceedings, the prosecution bears the burden of proof to establish that the person was an adult at the time of the relevant offence.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Small">Under the <span style="font-style:italic;">Migration Act 1958,</span> penalties for aggravated people smuggling offences do not apply to persons where it is 'established' on the balance of probabilities that they are under the age of 18 years.

                <span class="HPS-Small">There has been some inconsistency in the courts as to who bears the burden of proof. However, in practice, the CDPP has assumed the obligation of establishing whether the person is a minor or an adult, in cases where the defendant raises age as an issue.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Small">The Government will consider amendments to the Migration Act that would codify current practice by specifying that the prosecution bears the onus of proof in establishing age, where age is contested during a prosecution.</span>

                  <span style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;color:gray;">The committee recommends that the Australian Government review options to support the capacity of the legal representatives of persons accused of people smuggling offences who claim to be underage at the time of the offence to gather evidence of age from their place of origin.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Small">Commonwealth agencies facilitate access to legal aid by accused people smugglers as soon as the AFP requests to interview them. Commonwealth funding for legal aid in each State and Territory is provided through the Expensive Commonwealth Criminal Cases Fund. As part of this funding, legal aid representatives are entitled to claim the costs of reasonable disbursements, including costs associated with calling expert witnesses and gathering evidence of a defendant's age in their country of origin.

These calls last approximately two minutes, to enable them to let the receiver know of their wellbeing. Individuals are permitted further additional time on a case by case basis.

                <span class="HPS-Small">On 11 January 2012 the Chief Scientist, Professor Ian Chubb AC, advised AGD on the available scientific methods for determining chronological age.

                <span class="HPS-Small">The 'observed variation' of two years for wrist X rays, identified by the Chief Scientist, further indicated that the science of wrist X-rays and statistical analysis from that science was a contested issue that required further expert consideration.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Small">Between January and June 2012, AGD consulted further with the Office of the Chief Scientist on a number of age determination issues. This included seeking assistance on identifying available experts to assist the Commonwealth with the science of age determination, in particular to critically analyse the scientific and statistical basis for using wrist X-rays as an age determination procedure.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Small">On 29 June 2012, the Office of the Chief Scientist provided AGD with advice relating to statistics and wrist X-rays from Professor Patty Solomon. In her report, Professor Solomon concluded that there is not enough scientific data in either the Greulich and Pyle Atlas or the TW3 Manual for those experts to draw sufficiently precise inferences of chronological age for young Indonesian males.</span>

The process can be complicated where a request is made to a country where government records, including birth, marriage and other identity records, are not centrally held. Even where a mutual assistance request is urgent and prioritised, it can take up to several months to receive the material sought. This mutual assistance process is assisted by the bilateral mutual assistance treaty with Indonesia, the<span style="font-style:italic;color:gray;"> Treaty between Australia and the Republic of Indonesia on Mutual Legal Assistance in Criminal Matters</span>, done at Jakarta on 27 October 1995.</span>

Recently the AFP commenced seeking documents from Indonesian consular officials in Australia. Where documents received through these processes indicate the person may be a minor, the AFP considers this material in deciding whether to give the person the benefit of the doubt. However, INP officials have advised the AFP that a mutual assistance request is required to obtain documents for use as evidence in prosecutions (in most cases, documents indicating the person is an adult).</span>

                <span class="HPS-Small">The Government is keen to avoid delays in investigations for persons suspected of people smuggling offences who say that they are minors. The AFP requires adequate time to consider all relevant factors when making a decision to charge a person, and has worked hard to reduce the time taken to investigate people smuggling offences and prepare a brief of evidence, setting a benchmark timeframe of 90 days from interception to laying charges.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Small">The Government is committed to further reducing delays in the investigation of people smuggling offences. Commonwealth agencies are developing solutions to address delays, including seeking identity documents from Indonesian consular officials in the first instance, pending a mutual assistance request.

                <span class="HPS-Small">Unfortunately, there are often delays to the investigation process caused by environmental factors, which are difficult to avoid.

                <span class="HPS-Small">A Criminal Justice Stay Certificate (CJSC) operates to stay a non-citizen's removal and does not authorise or provide a legal basis for the non-citizen's detention. As set out in the written submission to the Senate Committee provided by AGD and the AFP, the person is detained pursuant to relevant provisions of the Migration Act (s189 and s250). If a CJSC is in force the Minister of Immigration and Citizenship may consider in his absolute discretion whether it is appropriate to issue a criminal justice stay visa which would entitle the person to be released from detention. The AFP and CDPP are the competent authorities in relation to investigations and prosecutions, and the Attorney-General's delegate may issue at the request of these agencies a CJSC to stay a person's removal. The Attorney-General's delegate necessarily relies on advice from these agencies as to whether the presence in Australia of a non-citizen is required for the purposes of the administration of criminal justice. AGD currently has procedures in place for the review of CJSCs, and in response to a recommendation made by the Australian Human Rights Commission has refined its procedures for review of CJSCs to include guidance on regular follow up with the AFP or CDPP, as relevant, for confirmation of the continuing need for the CJSC to ensure cancellation of certificates promptly once a person is no longer required. The Government considers its existing procedures for review of CJSCs to be appropriate.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Small">A person in immigration detention, or in remand in a criminal justice detention facility, can claim to be a minor at any time. It is not always the case that detainees claim to be minors at the point of interception, and it is not uncommon for claims about age to be made after the person has been detained for a period of time. Often challenges to the court's jurisdiction on the basis of age are made late in the proceedings, and in some cases claims about age are raised several times. Some age determination hearings are on the application of the defence. The defence has also, on occasion, asked that age determination proceedings be delayed while the defence gathers information.</span>

However, it remains Government policy that those engaged in people smuggling should not profit from such an activity. Hence, those people convicted of people smuggling continue to incur liability for both a detention and a removal debt. The Migration Act allows DIAC to freeze funds of people smugglers, and issue a garnishee notice to a third party, to recover that money as a means of meeting their Commonwealth debt. Under current arrangements<span style="font-style:italic;color:gray;">, </span>the extent to which removal and detention debts are recoverable depends on whether the person has funds available and the legal basis for the person's detention in Australia. DIAC is currently able to recover both detention and removal debts from crew who on their arrival were detained under section 189(3), because of section 250, of the Act as a suspected people smuggling offender, and who have not subsequently been issued with a Criminal Justice Stay Visa (CJSV). Crew who have been issued a CJSV under past procedures are only able to have debts recovered on a voluntary basis under the same arrangements in the Migration Act that apply to all unlawful non‑citizens who are being removed from Australia.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Small">The Government notes that the Committee made a similar recommendation in its Report 110 (<span style="font-weight:bold;">Recommendation 4</span>), and the Government's response to Report 110, which was tabled in February 2012, did not accept that recommendation. In considering <span style="font-weight:bold;">Recommendation 2</span> of the current Report, the Government has carefully considered its previous response to Report 110 and the operation of Australia's extradition framework since that response.

                <span class="HPS-Small">The Government reiterates its view that the most appropriate time at which to examine any potential human rights concerns is <span style="font-style:italic;">before</span> extradition occurs, during the extensive review process. This is consistent with Australia's obligations under international human rights law and with international extradition practice. As noted in the Government's Response to Report 110, the extradition process in Australia includes extensive procedural safeguards, which are included in the <span style="font-style:italic;">Extradition Act 1988</span> and in bilateral treaties. For example, Australia will not extradite a person if there are substantial grounds for believing that he or she would be in danger of being subjected to arbitrary deprivation of life, application of the death penalty, or cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment.</span>

This Act contains a number of significant amendments to further strengthen the protections in the <span style="font-style:italic;">Extradition Act 1988</span>. These amendments include a new ground for refusing extradition where the person may be punished, or discriminated against, upon surrender on the basis of his or her sex or sexual orientation, as well as amendments to strengthen protections in situations where a person may be subjected to torture. The Government will continue to closely monitor the operation of Australia's extradition framework, and will examine the need for any further amendments as required.</span>

The Government is able to conduct this monitoring because of the consular rights provided for under the <span style="font-style:italic;">Vienna Convention on Consular Relations</span> and the resources provided to support Australia's consular network. In 2011-12, the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade provided consular assistance to 236 Australian nationals serving prison sentences overseas. In addition, when a foreign national is extradited from Australia to a third country, the Government has agreed to formally advise that person's country of citizenship of his or her detention and extradition, subject to that person's consent (noting the constraints on the disclosure of personal information under the <span style="font-style:italic;">Privacy Act 1988</span>).</span>

                    </a>  If I could just make a couple of very brief comments. This was an inquiry that took place over quite a period of time. There was a significant number of submissions and a number of hearings that took evidence. It was particularly interesting because Australia has focused on investing in a lot of aid in Afghanistan since 2001, in helping with the reconstruction of many areas of Afghanistan and, in particular, investing a lot of those funds in the Reconstruction Task Force Fund. It was a particularly interesting inquiry, largely because of the number of projects that the Australian Defence Force have directly been involved in. It is one that I commend senators to have a look at. I seek leave to continue my remarks.</span>

                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">The National Measurement Amendment Bill 2013 is a bill to amend the National Measurement Act 1960. It introduces changes appropriate for the long-term operation of Australia's national trade measurement system, which has been in operation since July 2010.In Australia, an estimated $400 billion worth of trade based on some kind of measurement takes place annually.  Australia's trade measurement system provides the infrastructure needed to ensure that buyers and sellers both get a fair result.  It provides assurance that the quantity of pre-packaged goods is correct and that measuring instruments used for trade are sufficiently accurate.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">Trade measurement is a part of everyday life.  We are interacting with the trade measurement system whenever we buy products such as fuel or groceries on the basis of prices set in dollars per litre, or dollars per kilogram, or dollars per metre. These prices are set by the product's volume, weight, or length.  </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">Trade measurement rules also govern pre-packaged goods and are significant for the export of commodities, as well as measurements of gold, precious gems and the quality of agricultural products.  </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">The National Measurement Institute (the NMI) is responsible for overseeing the operation of Australia's trade measurement system.  As part of its "trade measurement compliance inspection program", the NMI employs trade measurement inspectors who inspect businesses nationwide for compliance with the act.  The proposals in the bill will facilitate their work and the ability of business to comply with the act and its regulations. </span>
                </p>

                  <span class="HPS-Small">Key amendments proposed in this bill deal with situations where NMI inspectors find minor non-compliance issues concerning a measuring instrument used for trade or the sale of pre-packaged goods.  Currently inspectors are required to obliterate the instrument's verification mark and cause the trader to immediately cease using the instrument.  Where the non-compliance applies to pre-packaged goods, the items are immediately removed from sale. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">These requirements can be unduly onerous to businesses and, in some situations, can disadvantage consumers.  Forcing products off the shelves, or preventing the use of a measuring instrument, can be a disproportionate response to a minor breach. It can also cause unintended difficulties for consumers, especially in rural and remote areas where the community may rely on a single retail outlet.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">The proposed amendment gives an inspector the discretion to issue a notice to a trader to remedy the non-compliance and allow a 28 day period during which they may continue using the instrument or retailing the goods which are subject to the minor non-compliance.  This change will give traders reasonable time to remedy any minor breaches and will retain consumer access to goods. </span>

                <p class="HPS-SmallBullet" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-SmallBullet">Enabling trade measurement inspectors to stop vehicles and request that they be moved to a reasonable location to be inspected.  This carries over powers previously available to inspectors under the former State and Territory trade measurement systems.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-SmallBullet" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-SmallBullet">NMI inspectors who are undertaking a random inspection of a business will no longer be required to announce their presence to a trader.  Random purchases are a useful tool in monitoring traders' compliance under the act and the amendment will support the purpose of detecting non-compliant behaviour.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-SmallBullet" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-SmallBullet">Clarifying the wording of the act to give greater certainty to customers about the measurement of an article.

                  <span class="HPS-Small">These disasters have taken a physical, emotional and financial toll on all Australians.  Most tragically, lives have been lost.

                  <span class="HPS-Small">Ensuring that individuals across Australia are supported in the aftermath of these disasters is critical to the recovery of communities. The Australian Government stands ready to support disaster ravaged communities, providing the support they need to get back on their feet. The Government already provides a range of assistance, both by working with the States through the Natural Disaster Relief and Recovery Arrangements, and directly with the Australian Government Disaster Recovery Payment and a number of ex-gratia disaster payments.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Small">The Australian Government Disaster Recovery Payment, or AGDRP, provides short term, one-off financial assistance to eligible Australians.  It offers a helping hand and has assisted thousands of Australians in recent years.  The AGDRP has a legislative basis in the Social Security Act 1991, which allows the Government to activate the AGDRP in response to a major disaster occurring in or outside Australia.  </span>

                  <span class="HPS-Small">This Government is serious about supporting jobs following a disaster, about keeping people employed in the local area, protecting skilled labour and the longer term recovery of the community.  Australian workers, businesses and farmers are resilient.  But in times of great difficulty they may require that extra help to get them back on their feet and back to work. </span>

                  <span class="HPS-Small">The Disaster Recovery Allowance will standardise the highly successful assistance that is currently being provided as the ex-gratia Disaster Income Recovery Subsidy.  The ex-gratia Subsidy provides fortnightly payments equivalent to the maximum rate of Newstart Allowance or Youth Allowance, depending on a person’s circumstances.  The Subsidy supports those who, through no fault of their own, temporarily lose income as a direct result of a disaster.  While the ex-gratia payment has worked well this past summer to meet this need, cementing the Disaster Recovery Allowance in legislation will provide a permanent and administratively efficient method for providing this assistance to communities. We have seen the value of such a legislated disaster recovery payment with the AGDRP. </span>

                  <span class="HPS-Small">The Government will have the option of making the Disaster Recovery Allowance available for events of national significance where assistance in the form of income support is required.  In making this decision we will consider the extent to which the nature or extent of the event is unusual, and the extent of disruption to the workforce.  </span>
                </p>

                  <span class="HPS-Small">This Government recognises that each event is unique and the needs of each community will be different.  That is why the Disaster Recovery Allowance will focus on either the areas that are affected, or the industries that are affected, or both.  This means that it can apply broadly across a region, or just to an affected industry, depending on the impact of the event.  </span>

                  <span class="HPS-Small">While we are committed to supporting disaster-affected workers getting back on their feet, we do not want to create a disincentive for people to go back to work.  For this reason the Disaster Recovery Allowance will be subject to reductions.  This will ensure that recipients are encouraged to return to work when possible, restoring that normality to their lives.</span>

                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">The Disaster Recovery Allowance will be payable for 13 weeks.  For those who have not been able to find work at the end of this period, the Department of Human Services will help them transition to the Newstart or Youth Allowance, and they will have access to all of the existing Commonwealth programs that help people get back to work. </span>

                  <span class="HPS-Small">We recognise that sometimes the full impact of a disaster is not felt straight away, particularly economic impacts. For this reason, and to allow adequate time for applications, the claim period for the Disaster Recovery Allowance will stay open for 6 months after the disaster.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">

                  <span class="HPS-Small">Introduction of the Disaster Recovery Allowance reflects the Australian Government’s commitment to supporting communities affected by disasters. The Disaster Recovery Allowance is about more than individuals, it is about getting communities back on their feet.  We are seeing again with the recent disasters in Queensland, New South Wales, Victoria and Tasmania that Australians want to help each other out after a disaster, and they want to lend a hand.  The Disaster Recovery Allowance makes sure that those people whose income has been hit by the disaster do not need to worry about getting food on the table, they can focus on what Australians want to be doing in that situation, which is helping their friends, their neighbours, their community in getting back on their feet and putting their lives back together.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Small">Disasters will happen in this country.  With the changing climate, conditions will become more extreme and disasters will happen more frequently. With each year this is becoming clearer. It is a reality we cannot ignore and we must be as prepared as possible for future events.  That is why this Government is committed to improving the assistance we provide and the way it is delivered.  With each year we, as a Nation, and as a Government, are getting better at preparing, mitigating and responding to disasters.  This Bill is a further step in that process.  It provides the Commonwealth with the ability to respond to disasters and to support the communities that are affected.  These tools give us a greater sophistication in disaster recovery, they give us the certainty that the money is getting where it is needed.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Small">As part of building a seamless national economy, the Australian Government is committed to reform of the regulation of agricultural chemicals and veterinary medicines (or agvet chemicals). A single national regulator, supported by state and Northern Territory laws, has been in place since 1993. However, it is evident that its effectiveness is hampered by the legislative framework it must implement.</span>

Agvet chemicals are needed to control disease and to protect people, companion animals, infrastructure and the environment. They are necessary tools for our export focussed agriculture sector and for future food security. They allow safe and efficient food and fibre production. </span>

                  <span class="HPS-Small">It was the foresight of the Hawke and Keating Governments, working in partnership with their state and territory counterparts, that put in place Australia's first national regulator for agvet chemicals. It is now almost 20 years since this system began, and it has served the community well over this period. But as with all legislated systems, they can fall behind best practice.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">Human understanding of the natural and chemical world changes every single day. For this reason, we must have a dynamic regulator, with a systematic, risk-based approach to protecting human health and the environment. At the same time, the regulator must take into account the views of the community.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">It is clear that the community expects a rigorous scientific approach to agvet chemical assessments. But it also expects that these assessments will occur on a regular basis so they remain up-to-date. This is something the current system has failed to do.We must recognise that many agvet chemicals are designed to kill pests and that they may be dangerous. This is the reason we have a product approval system in place to protect the community and the environment, those who use the chemicals, and those industries that rely on the use of these chemicals. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">It is vital for these industries that the community retains its confidence in the methods used to produce food in Australia and to protect the environment. And for this reason it is vital that Australia has a strong, predictable regulatory system.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">The Agricultural and Veterinary Chemicals Legislation Amendment Bill 2012 confirms that protecting human health and the environment is Australia's first priority in regulating agvet chemicals. The Bill amends the suite of agvet chemical legislation to further modernise, and improve the effectiveness of, the current system. It will provide better protection for human health and the environment, thus maintaining community confidence in our food and fibre production. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">The Australian Pesticide and Veterinary Medicines Authority, known as the APVMA, is the regulator of agvet chemicals in Australia. The Bill amends the legislation administered by the APVMA to improve its effectiveness and responsiveness in regulating these chemicals. These amendments allow the APVMA to maintain its status with the community as a trusted regulator. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">The Bill will modernise the APVMA's administration. Perhaps more importantly, the Bill will require the APVMA to provide greater clarity around its requirements. The APVMA will develop and publish its principles and processes for regulating agricultural chemicals and veterinary medicines to complement these legislative amendments. This work has already begun within the APVMA and will continue into the future. The work to develop a risk framework, together with powers to reject poor quality applications, will encourage industry to make good quality applications. This in turn will allow the APVMA to do its job more efficiently and with greater predictability. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">The amendments in the Bill enhance the consistency and transparency of assessments of agricultural chemicals and veterinary medicines. Legislative amendments enable the APVMA to align regulatory effort with chemical risk. The reforms implemented by the Bill will result in a more straightforward assessment process that is easier to understand, more cost effective to administer, and provide greater certainty to the community that agvet chemicals used in Australia are safe. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">The Bill includes measures that implement an election commitment to ensure the ongoing safety of agricultural chemicals and veterinary medicines and improve the current chemical review arrangements. Introduction of a mandatory re-approval and re-registration scheme brings Australia into line with other countries which have similar schemes such as the United States and Europe. The scheme has been designed to complement the specific characteristics of the Australian agvet market, so it delivers the desired outcomes without unnecessarily resulting in withdrawal of safe and useful chemicals. This measure responds to community concerns by ensuring that approved or registered chemicals continue to meet appropriate health and safety standards.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">Other measures in the Bill provide for greater transparency and predictability about reconsiderations. The measures in the Bill achieve this by, for the first time, providing for timeframes for reconsiderations and prescribing timeframes for when information is provided to the APVMA for reconsideration. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">The amendments in the Bill remove any remaining trace of an impediment to the APVMA's use of overseas assessments and data. This is on the proviso that the assessments are conducted by agencies that are comparable to the APVMA, and that overseas data are relevant to Australian conditions, agricultural practices and animal husbandry.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">Other measures in the Bill improve the ability of the APVMA to enforce compliance with its regulatory decisions by providing the APVMA with a graduated range of compliance and enforcement powers. This will improve the ability of the APVMA to efficiently administer its regulatory decisions to protect public health and safety and the environment. Not only will this allow industry to take greater responsibility for ensuring compliance, but it will not reduce the APVMA's ability to take strong regulatory action where this is necessary to protect the community, animals and the environment. Often, the only option currently available to the APVMA is to take a person to court, a process that is not appropriate for many behaviours. The APVMA needs to be able to ensure that registrants and companies comply with all elements of the law. Therefore, the sanctions cannot be such that they can merely be factored in as a cost of doing business. The additional measures are similar to those available to other regulators under Commonwealth laws and ensure that contemporary safeguards are in place for regulated entities. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">The existing legislation compensates intellectual property owners for the impact of the product approval system by protecting submitted data in a number of situations. The current data protection provisions are improved by the Bill. The Bill also removes disincentives for business to invest in chemical product development and extends data protection eligibility to a wider range of data and increases the time that the data is protected. These measures ensure that innovators can obtain a fair return on their research investment. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">The APVMA currently obtains the majority of its income from a levy it collects, based on the value of sales of registered agvet chemical products. While this arrangement is not unusual, it may lead to a perception of a conflict of interest. Therefore, the Bill provides for an agency other than the APVMA to collect the levy. However, in making any decision to change the way this levy is collected, the Government will consider issues of cost-effectiveness and efficiency.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">The Bill modernises and updates the suite of Commonwealth legislation for agricultural chemicals and veterinary medicines. Recognising the scope of the changes, the Bill includes a requirement for a review to be conducted of measures in the Bill in five years, and all Commonwealth legislation for agricultural chemicals and veterinary medicines every ten tears. This will ensure that legislative measures operate as intended and remain appropriate.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">Current agvet legislation is criticised as being an impenetrable maze of complexity. This complexity not only makes it difficult to administer, it makes it hard for companies that need to engage with the regulator. In response, and consistent with its wider role of improving the clarity and accessibility of Commonwealth legislation, the government has done extensive revisions to the agricultural chemicals and veterinary medicines legislation to bring it up to contemporary standards for legislative drafting. The improvements in comprehension and utility delivered by these revisions are significant, with benefits particularly for improved efficiency in complying with and administering the legislation.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">At any one time, the APVMA has several thousand applications in process. It also has a register of nearly 10 000 chemical products. The Bill includes appropriate transitional measures to allow processing to continue for those in the system. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">Overall, the Bill will increase community confidence in the regulation of agvet chemicals, while reducing the unnecessary impost on business. The reforms to agvet chemicals legislation in the Bill will ensure that agricultural productivity can continue to improve and keep Australia at the forefront of innovative food and fibre production. </span>

                  <span class="HPS-Small">While the Productivity Commission Report found that market failures are most likely to affect small and medium-sized enterprises with limited export experience, EFIC's new mandate will not preclude it from supporting larger firms where they too face market failures, particularly when doing business in emerging and frontier markets.</span>

                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">Where provisions like this are included in a fund's governing rules, superannuation fund trustees are prevented from selecting other service providers, insurance companies or investment vehicles, even where it would be in the best interests of fund members to do so. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">A recent report by APRA found that situations where a trust deed required trustees to use a related insurance provider resulted in higher-cost insurance products provided to members.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Small">The Bill will ensure a trustee is obliged to enter into arrangements which are in the best interests of members.</span>

                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">The Bill also implements the Cooper Review recommendation to give APRA the power to impose infringement notices as an alternative to criminal prosecution. This will allow APRA to impose a more appropriate and flexible range of penalties for minor breaches of the SIS Act. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">The Bill will improve individuals' rights in relation to access to reasons for decisions from trustees. Currently, when members and beneficiaries make complaints to trustees, trustees are not required to provide reasons for their decisions. This Bill will ensure people have a right to obtain information from trustees in relation to decisions that affect them. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">Requiring trustees to provide reasons for decisions in relation to death benefit complaints is particularly important given the statistics from the Superannuation Complaints Tribunal Annual Report for 2011 12 which show that death benefit complaints account for almost a third of all written complaints received by the Tribunal each year.</span>
                </p>

                  <span class="HPS-Small">The Bill also provides more time for members and beneficiaries to lodge complaints with the Tribunal in respect of total and permanent disability claims. The increased time to lodge complaints aligns the treatment as closely as possible with the courts and the Financial Ombudsman Service.</span>

                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">Currently, these entities only have to meet resource and risk management requirements, administered by APRA, that are focussed on the entity's superannuation business.

                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">The Bill will close this gap and these entities will need to also meet resource and risk management requirements, administered by ASIC, that seek to protect the interests of investors in the non-superannuation schemes they manage.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">Following feedback from industry, these new requirements will commence a year later, from 1 July 2015. APRA and ASIC will work together and with industry on how the respective resource requirements will apply in practice. </span>

                  <span class="HPS-Small">The Bill also addresses concerns that have been raised about the Superannuation Legislation Amendment (Trustee Obligations and Prudential Standards) Act 2012 in relation to director liability. </span>

                  <span class="HPS-Small">This Bill inserts a requirement for persons seeking to take legal action against a director for a breach of their duties to first seek leave from the Court. </span>

                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">The Bill also extends the availability of a defence for directors and trustees if their breach was due to reasonable mistake. The defence will now cover breaches of MySuper duties.</span>

                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">In response to concerns raised in consultation, a further change is being made to the defences in relation to investment and management of reserves. The changes will clarify that each defence is available where a trustee or director can establish compliance with all of the covenants and MySuper obligations that are relevant to the particular loss or damage suffered. </span>

                  <span class="HPS-Small">These changes have been developed in consultation with industry and will better balance the rights of super fund members and the protection of directors and trustees against frivolous or vexatious litigation.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Small">The Bill also makes consequential amendments to ensure the effective operation of the first three tranches of MySuper and governance legislation. In particular, the amendments recognise that various provisions in the existing legislation will in future be dealt with in APRA's prudential standards. </span>

                  <span class="HPS-Small">TAX LAWS AMENDMENT (COUNTERING TAX AVOIDANCE AND MULTINATIONAL PROFIT SHIFTING) BILL 2013</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">This Bill amends the income tax law to protect the integrity of Australia’s income tax system.  These reforms come forward at a time of unprecedented global recognition that base erosion and profit shifting must be addressed.  </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">Last night, the OECD released its latest report on Addressing Base Erosion and Profit Shifting, which identified modern transfer pricing rules and effective anti avoidance rules as two of the key weapons in the fight against base erosion and profit shifting. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">As the OECD report says, ‘What is at stake is the integrity of the corporate income tax.’</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">The Government is committed to taking steps where necessary to ensure the integrity and sustainability of the tax system. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">Without these amendments, significant amounts of revenue that should be available for the benefit of all Australians would be at risk of not being collected.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">Schedule 1 amends Part IVA of the Income Tax Assessment Act 1936 which is the income tax law’s general anti-avoidance rule.  The amendments ensure that Part IVA continues to counter schemes that comply with the technical requirements of the tax law but which, when viewed objectively, are conducted in a particular way mainly to avoid tax.  Without this, there would be significant scope for taxpayers to plan their way around the law’s intended operation and undermine the revenue base.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">Part IVA applies when three elements exist.  There must be a scheme; there must be a tax benefit obtained in connection with the scheme; and it must be reasonable to conclude that someone entered into the scheme for the sole or dominant purpose of obtaining a tax benefit in connection with the scheme.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">Some recent cases have focused on the ‘tax benefit’ element of Part IVA’s operation.  A tax benefit exists if a scheme produces a tax advantage (for example, reduced assessable income or increased deductions) being an advantage that would not have been obtained, or might reasonably be expected not to have been obtained, if the scheme had not been entered into.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">There are two limbs to ‘tax benefit’.  The first limb — concerning tax advantages that ‘would’ not have been obtained without the scheme — deals appropriately with cases where simply removing the scheme reveals a coherent taxable situation consistent with the substance of what happened.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">The second limb — concerning tax advantages that ‘might reasonably be expected’ not to have been obtained absent the scheme — deals with cases where what is left after simply removing the scheme would not make sense or would be inconsistent with the taxpayer’s actual commercial objectives and instead requires a prediction about alternative ways that the substance of what happened might reasonably have been achieved.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">The amendments reinforce the view that the two limbs of the tax benefit element of Part IVA are alternative tests; that there is not just one test that merely spans a spectrum of likelihood.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">The amendments also ensure, in deciding whether an alternative to the scheme is reasonable, that regard is had both to the substance of the scheme and to the non tax results or consequences for the taxpayer that the scheme achieved.  In making that decision, the tax consequences of the alternative are ignored. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">The proper role for the tax benefit test is to compare the tax consequences of what the taxpayer actually did with the tax consequences of a reasonable alternative that achieves substantively the same thing.  It makes little sense in an anti-avoidance provision to allow the tax consequences of what the taxpayer has achieved to act as a shield against the operation of Part IVA.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">These amendments ensure that a taxpayer who, having achieved something from a scheme (tax results aside), cannot say they did not obtain a tax benefit by arguing that, absent the scheme, they would have pursued completely different objectives, or done nothing at all.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">These amendments have been through an extensive consultation process.  In addition to the Government’s usual public consultation on draft legislation, the design process included a lengthy series of consultations with a roundtable of academic, legal and tax experts, and advice from a number of senior counsel.  As a result, the Government is confident that these amendments will ensure that Part IVA properly protects the integrity of the tax law without unnecessarily interfering with taxpayers’ normal commercial activities.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">Schedule 2 to this Bill modernises Australia’s transfer pricing rules in accordance with the Government’s announcement in November 2011.  It provides a new, comprehensive and robust transfer pricing regime that is aligned with internationally accepted principles.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">The transfer pricing rules are critical to the integrity of the tax system.  They ensure that an appropriate return for the contribution of Australian operations of a multinational group is taxable in Australia for the benefit of the broader community.  </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">The transfer pricing rules do not depend on the existence of a tax avoidance purpose.  Transfer pricing rules ensure an arm’s length tax outcome is achieved for non-arm’s length arrangements or transactions, even where those arrangements or transactions have a legitimate commercial purpose.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">A key feature of the new rules is their alignment with international best practice as set out by the OECD.  Alignment with international norms improves the integrity and efficiency of the tax system, and reduces compliance costs and uncertainty for taxpayers.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">The OECD’s Transfer Pricing Guidelines are widely used by tax administrations and multinational enterprises globally.  The amendments provide a clear legal pathway to the use of OECD guidance material to assist in applying the arm’s length principle. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">As well as alignment with the OECD guidance material, several design features of the new rules will further promote efficiency and certainty.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">The new rules operate on a self-assessment basis, bringing the transfer pricing rules in line with the overall design of the Australian tax system.  In contrast to the old rules, which relied upon the Commissioner making a determination, taxpayers will now be able to self-assess their Australian tax position in accordance with the arm’s length principle.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">Specific rules linking voluntary documentation with a reduction in administrative penalties are included under the new rules.  This approach balances compliance costs for taxpayers with incentives to adequately document issues relevant to transfer pricing matters.  It allows taxpayers to risk assess matters that could be the subject of administrative penalties and prepare documentation accordingly.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">The new rules also introduce a time limit in which the Commissioner may amend a taxpayer’s assessment to give effect to a transfer pricing adjustment.  Under the previous rules, the Commissioner had an unlimited period in which to amend an assessment.  These rules reduce this period to seven years.  Given that transfer pricing audits often require information from other jurisdictions and involve complex arrangements spanning several income years, this time limit strikes an appropriate balance between providing the Commissioner with the time required to conduct an audit, and providing taxpayers with increased certainty as to their tax affairs.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">The new rules also maintain the existing interaction between the transfer pricing and thin capitalisation rules that were developed in close consultation with industry during amendments to the transfer pricing rules last year.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">The Government has engaged extensively with industry, corporate, and community representatives over the course of the reforms to Australia’s transfer pricing rules.  The Bill has benefited significantly as a result of the consultation process.  I would like to acknowledge these important contributions to the policy design process. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">The measures contained in this Bill are vital for maintaining the integrity of the Australian income tax system.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">Robust and properly functioning integrity rules are critical to maintaining a healthy tax system so that the Government can continue to deliver the public goods and services that Australians expect and require, like world class health and education systems, a strong social safety net and public infrastructure.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">

The issue is that the Environment Protection and Biodiversity Conservation Act will be utilised to give greater oversight over protection of the aquifers. It is something that we are supporting. I think this is very important for former Gunnedah mayor, John Lyle, for his wife, Suzie, for people such as Xavier Martin, and for other people on the plains around Breeza and other places east of the Condamine River—people who have a serious concern about that. So let's clearly state that we are supporting this. After debate, after lobbying and after working hard on their behalf, we are supporting this.</span>

                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">But I think it also needs to be stated that you can understand the frustration that is held by the government when one of the so-called champions of this, Mr Windsor, seems to want to sit on both sides of the fence. That is clearly understood because he sold his place to a coal miner. He sold it not just for an ordinary price but for an extremely good price—almost $5,000 an acre. He has been highly sensitive about this. We could see that the other day when I was accosted in the media gallery about this issue. He wanted to, as he said, take it outside. Obviously, the impending threat of litigation, which of course you just do not have the resources to do—</span>

                    </a>  Senator Wong, you should not interject. You should be polite. Quite clearly, Mr Windsor never went outside of parliament when in the past he accused the Deputy Prime Minister of Australia, John Anderson, of bribery. He did not go outside and make that allegation because it was fallacious, wrong and stupid; nor did Mr Windsor go outside and reassert allegations he made about Senator Sandy Macdonald. So it is a bit rich for him to be making statements about a coward's castle, because it is a place where he has resided quite happily a number of times.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I noted in Mr Windsor's letter to the editor on 28 July 2010 that he gave a number of points in seriatim and they run completely counter to the arguments that he is spreading around the district. He gives an explanation for why they could mine coal on his family's place. It has been in his family for I do not know how many generations, but they grew a very good crop of sunflower there, so it must be decent land. He runs this explanation of why coalmining is quite appropriate there but just down the road it is not. The argument was on the premise of the EPBC Act and water aquifers. In fact, he states himself in his letter to the editor:</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">10. A gravel ridge is the type of land that should be mined, not the fertile land of the Liverpool Plains.</span>
                </p>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The problem with that is that Shenhua and BHP were looking at mining on gravel ridges and he was one of the people protesting against it. You cannot have it both ways. You cannot decide one day because it works in your favour financially that you agree with mining so you can get paid $5,000 an acre for country which sales data of about that time indicates should get you, at best, $2,000 or $3,000 an acre—so you got way above the market for it—and then stand literally down the road and have a completely different position. It just makes you look like a total and utter hypocrite.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Point 7 of his letter to the editor says:</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">It is believed there will be an application to extend the Coal Company's mining area at some time in the future—that application may impact on "Cintra" land if approval were to be given. The Coal Company has a legitimate right to make such an application.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">So he knew full well that his family's place was going to become a coalmine. It is a point of interest as to how that application went. Who approved it and why? A fair question to ask is: which state ministers at that point in time were part of that approval process? There might be nothing to answer for or there might be further questions to ask, but I think that is a fair question that can be asked in this chamber; it is a fair question that needs an answer. If the answer makes sense, the issue rests; but, if the answer does not, further questions need to be asked. That would be fair enough as well.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Mr Windsor says:</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">4. The Coal Company has purchased a number of properties within what is called the "zone of affectation" of mining activities.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">5. Most of these properties will not be mined.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Why does he say that? Coalmining companies generally buy country because they have an expectation that there is coal somewhere around it. There may be buffer areas, but most of them will be mined. If you go through Werris Creek now, what you see is a massive mine. If someone had concerns about water tables, they are certainly not showing much concern there. It just seems peculiar that you could say, 'We'll just close our eyes and pretend that mine on the edge of Werris Creek doesn't exist. We'll pretend it's not there.' If you stand behind the mining industry, that is well and good. I believe in the mining industry. I think Australia would be broke without the mining industry, but I have no coalmine on my family's place. There is not one there.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">To return to this piece of legislation, we need to make sure that we afford these people protections. A principle that we stand behind with coal seam gas, because a lot of this is pertinent to coal seam gas, is that there will be no coal seam gas extraction on primary agricultural land. If you are getting $5,000 an acre—if that is its true value; if that is really what it was worth—that sounds like primary agricultural land to me. That is a pretty good price. In other areas, you would have to be buying irrigation country for that amount. I do not know how you would go right now—if you were willing to buy land at $5,000 an acre, I reckon you would be buying the best land in the district. In fact, I think you would be buying the best land in the district with a lot of change left over. I do not know why someone would pay you $5,000 an acre. They get the land and you get the money—but anyway.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">You should not be mining on primary agricultural land. You should not be destroying aquifers. When they put a coalmine down on a place, they never really questioned it much then. You should not be near—and this is pertinent—to domestic dwellings. I can assure you that this mine on Mr Windsor's place is right on the edge of town. It is right next to a residential area. I used to live there. I lived at 31 Gordon Street, Werris Creek. That was my house—it was the first house I bought for myself and my wife. My local member was Tony Windsor, in state politics at that time, I think. If you are on the land—</span>

They have been very close, at a state level and at a federal level—at a state level in trying to make sure that their interests are looked after, and at a federal level in making sure that their interests are looked after.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We do not believe it should be on prime agricultural land. If you are selling something for $5,000 an acre, that would sound to me like prime agricultural land, because I do not know where you would be buying land, I really do not, for $5,000 an acre, even today—not for dryland farming. I would say that that would be one of the top prices you could possibly pay. Would that be a fair comment, Senator Heffernan? Senator Heffernan nods. He knows this country.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">As far as aquifers go, I reckon putting in a coal mine would raise a few questions. Now, the big one is: should it be next to towns? This mine is on what was Mr Windsor's place. He has got it back now on a peppercorn rent. He also got the next-door neighbour's place on a peppercorn rent. It is an awfully good trick, except the neighbour wanted it back himself on a peppercorn rent—but I think Mr Windsor has got it. It is right next to town, so that is a bit of a problem. The final thing is: a fair return should go back to the landholder. I must admit, he ticked that box. He got that one right. He got a very fair return back to the landholder. So maybe on one issue, a fair return to the landholder, we and Mr Windsor are on the same ticket. We have to make sure that in dealing with this industry we acknowledge that. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Mr Windsor is working with mining companies. He has sold his place to a coalmining company. He got a very good price for his place and has obviously of late had a very strong working relationship or has been in discussions with Mr Palmer. Good luck to him! That is all right; I have no problems with that. It is clear to see that having a strong working relationship with mining and being the strong benefactor of what has happened in mining makes sense. This is obviously one of the questions that people ask: who were the ministers at the time?</span>

                    </a>  Yes. If there is nothing that needs to be answered, that is fair enough. We just need to clear the air; that is all. We just need to clear the air and get it off the cards. It is now very important that this piece of legislation goes through and that the people around Kiruna, the people around Breeza, the people around Nea, the people around Werris Creek and the people around Quirindi clearly understand that we support this legislation—because they will be reading this; you can bet your life on it—and that Xavier Martin, John Lyall and even Tim Duddy understand that we are in support of this legislation. They can communicate to the people of the area that we support this legislation and, in supporting this legislation, that we clearly show that the coalition in New England are trying to work to resolve issues. Hopefully, they will have a strong hand in a future coalition government to continue the work that needs to be done to make sure that we get the proper balance right.</span>

                      <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Senator McKENZIE</span>
                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Victoria</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">16:03</span>):  I rise to contribute to the debate on the Environment Protection and Biodiversity Conservation Amendment Bill 2013. That is not to be confused with the EPBC Amendment Bill 2012. I have both reports here. They say slightly different things, I admit, from the government's perspective. Nonetheless, I am a member of the Senate Environment and Communications Legislation Committee and, throughout the inquiry into this piece of legislation, the committee received 235 submissions from across industry, environmental groups and community. There was a keen interest in discussing this particular matter.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The bill seeks to amend the EPBC Act by creating a new manner of national environmental significance under the act. Currently, there are eight matters of national environmental significance, including World Heritage properties, Commonwealth marine areas, wetlands, national heritage places and the like. The amendments go to set out requirements and civil offences regarding actions which could have a significant impact on water resources, from coal seam gas to large coalmining developments.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The impact of coal seam gas on regional communities is of great concern to the Nationals and the coalition generally. To get the balance right between farmers, community and the environment is paramount. It is summed up best by the Nationals leader, Warren Truss, in 2011, when he stated:</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">A properly managed coal seam gas industry represents an unprecedented opportunity for regional Australia. Poorly managed it could tick every box of a social and environmental disaster. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This is why we have developed some core principles around the development of the industry, in direct response to community concerns.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The core principles go to the heart of the concerns about inappropriate developments. I think Senator Joyce has already touched on these. Firstly, no coal seam gas development should proceed where it poses a significant impact on groundwater or surface water; it has to be safe for the environment. Secondly, prime agricultural land is our most precious asset; its value drives our regional communities and our export industry. We do not want to see any negative impact on that. Thirdly, regional Australia is home to many thousands of locals living in our towns, cities and districts. We think that the development of the coal seam gas industry needs to take the concerns of those householders into account. Fourthly, we believe landowners are entitled to appropriate returns for access to and use of their land that goes beyond mere compensation. Finally, there needs to be a recognition that, as regional communities are the areas contributing to the development of this resource, it is only fair that they receive a fair share of revenue generated by the industry so that they can reinvest that in their communities.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We have been upfront in outlining our desire for appropriate development of this industry, recognising that it also brings much needed jobs and economic stimulus to regional areas. But, again, I reiterate that it must be balanced. That is why we are not opposing this bill. However, there were numerous issues raised throughout the inquiry, which included several suggested amendments that the government could consider. They are sensible amendments, supported by both sides of this debate—those sides being environmentalists and industry. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Both recognise that there was no consultation in the construction of this bill—that is, with any of the groups involved: farmers, industry or environmental groups. That evidence is borne out in our Senate committee report. This suggests that once again the federal government has sought to play politics instead of being guided by principles. Look at how that particular strategy has gone so far: five years of politics ahead of policy and principles has resulted in bills requiring significant amendment and having unintended consequences, and a legislative agenda that reads like a stakeholder wish list—I would cite the latest tranche of the Fairwork amendments as an example—as the national long-term interest of this nation is butchered on the altar of the Labor Party's desperation to cling onto power. The desire to cling on to power overrides good policy process. There is no regulatory impact statement with this bill; there was no consultation with stakeholders, states, industry, famers or environmental groups. The minister himself stated six months ago that the Commonwealth government had no constitutional powers to make such laws that would seek to regulate coal seam gas—and he was right. Yet the Greens foreshadowed amendments using the executive power under our Constitution, and I look forward to Senator Waters moving those later on in this debate so we can have a conversation about them. But it was clear that the government consulted with someone—their powerful allies and co-conspirators in the ALP government's longevity and negative legislative agenda. These powerful allies in this game of national and moral fiscal malaise are none other than Tony Windsor, the member for New England, and the Greens.</span>

                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This bill and its process of development has been categorised by haste, lack of consultation, lack of a regulatory impact statement and lack of clarity, which was raised over and over again throughout the inquiry. There is ambiguity about the impact it will have on the process of environmental legislative reform that is already underway that states are having a national conversation about on how we can get better at this as a team. Mr Windsor's determination to support them is a perfect example of this government's determination to hang on to power for as long as it can. It is a very powerful alliance, indeed.</span>

                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Nobody disputes the importance of getting the balance right. What is a point of debate, as the report rightly states in the government majority section, is that the regulation of coal seam gas is 'primarily a matter for states'. This bill supersedes the cooperative process already in place and already being conducted to deal with the issues of coal seam gas developments. That is precisely why the national partnership on coal seam gas and large coalmining proposals is important—a COAG process working collaboratively with the states to bring state environmental laws up to federal standards without impacting on their sovereignty. It has been, according to stakeholders in the process, circumvented by this bill. I refer specifically to the evidence given to the committee by the NFF representative Ms Kerr.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This process has been time consuming and people have approached it in good faith, but they are now left wondering as to the status of the review due next year and what role that will play. I know the Greens do not like state parliaments. Our federated structure is an anathema for them—ironic, really, as they sit here in the states' chamber in federal parliament.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">As Senator Birmingham noted in his contribution to this debate, the coalition supports the work of the independent scientific committee as it provides up-to-date advice to both state governments, who are tasked with approving and assessing coal seam gas developments, and, indeed, the federal minister on matters deemed appropriate. This is a good initiative; we support it. To make the coalition out to be environmental vandals because we support scientific oversight and a collaborative approach to the national partnership on coal seam gas which brings the stakeholders together makes the hypocrisy of the Greens and Mr Windsor clear.</span>

                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I recognise that the development of the coal seam gas industry in New South Wales is a significant issue to local landowners and communities; however, using the federal EPBC Act as a method for riding roughshod over the rights of states to regulate what occurs within their boundaries is an abuse of Commonwealth power. As Fiona Simson, President of NSW Farmers, stated to a question about her preferred option for how to deal with the issues of coal seam gas development in New South Wales:</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">My preferred option, and our association's preferred option, remains that the state government provide the protections that it promised it would prior to coming into office. We feel that that could quite easily happen through some of the instruments are currently in place—by making the aquifer interference policy enforceable, for instance.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Mr Gregson from the New South Wales Irrigators' Council said:</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">I think it would be our preference if New South Wales were to revisit its perspective and make its good set of rules applicable to at least someone so that we do not have to have the difference between the two jurisdictions.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">It is clear, I think, that harmonisation is the way forward, rather than regulating all to fix one.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">It may be news to the Greens that some states have taken a different approach to mining development. I would like to highlight one such state involved in this debate which has taken a different approach, one reflective of the coalition's stance on the development of our regions with respect to the mining industry—my home state of Victoria. It will now be subject to additional legislation and regulation and will be unable, if the Windsor amendment is passed, to seek bilateral agreements with the Commonwealth simply because New South Wales could not get it right. There is no coal seam gas production in Victoria and still no confirmed commercial reserves. However, the Victorian government is taking a very careful approach to the issue of coal seam gas and is determined not to rush into anything. It will not put at risk the water aquifers, agricultural production and liveability that are the hallmarks of the magnificent regional areas of Victoria. It has taken a strong, responsible approach to managing issues associated with coal seam gas. While further work is being undertaken at a Commonwealth and state level to better understand and manage the prospect of coal seam gas development, the state coalition has taken decisive action to protect local communities, including: a hold on approvals to undertake hydraulic fracturing as part of onshore gas exploration; a hold on the issuing of new exploration licences for coal seam gas; and a ban on the use of BTEX chemicals in hydraulic fracturing in Victoria.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This action is in addition to Victoria's already tough regulatory framework that includes Victoria's environmental protection policy under the Environment Protection Act 1970, which does not allow discharge from exploration and mining activities that will pollute groundwater. The Victorian state government is responsibly investigating approaches to ensuring both ongoing gas supplies and energy security with respect to natural gas development. That includes unconventional sources such as tight gas, shale gas and coal seam gas.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">While some in the community would like to see the government permanently ban these industries, the state government does not believe that is a responsible approach. Despite the potential economic benefits of unconventional gas, protection of the environment is the state government's first priority. It goes right against the claims of the Greens that somehow state governments are subject to a conflict of interest around the approval of coalmining activities in terms of the state royalties they collect. But the Victorian state government has taken the sensible approach by participating in the national partnership conversation and is looking at what has happened under previous and current governments in Queensland and New South Wales. It is looking at a way to better regulate the development of the coal seam gas industry, and particularly its impact on regional communities. To legislate for all and to regulate all because of the bad behaviour of a few undermines all the potential good that could come from appropriately developed coal seam gas projects.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I would like to briefly mention Labor's record in Victoria. Licences to explore for coal seam gas have existed in Victoria for the last 12 years. It was the former Labor government that granted those exploration licences. Over 70 per cent of the 24 current exploration licences were issued under the former Labor government. Fracking was last approved and undertaken under the former Labor state government in 2009. It is interesting that Senator Cameron is not here spruiking the track record of the New South Wales Labor government on this issue. I look forward to him arriving in the chamber and standing up for the decisions made by the former New South Wales state Labor government with respect to mining development and more specifically to coal seam gas development throughout regional New South Wales. And where are Queensland senators? I am looking—Senator Feeney, Senator Brown, but no Queensland senators from the Labor Party. Senator Waters, I am more than happy if you want to stand up and spruik former Premier Bligh's track record on approvals and assessment of coal seam gas projects in Queensland, but I am guessing you will not be wanting to do that. Correct. Any Queensland Labor senators should head on down. We would love to hear your take on coal seam gas mining project development approvals and assessments in Queensland. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">It is a bit rich that this bill is before us now. The fact is the concerns outlined by Senator Birmingham and the issues canvassed throughout the committee's report are specific to some state governments and that was made very clear in the evidence, but not all state governments—and not even a majority of state governments, just a handful. Here we are legislating in an area where we do not know what the unintended consequences are. There is ambiguity around definitions, which I hope to get to. A number of issues were raised during the inquiry that are not dealt with in the bills or in the amendments before us. Regarding the issues raised, I will touch on three, and they are clarity, overriding state processes and unintended consequences.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Clarity in definitions is important, and it is particularly important when writing laws—because lawyers get paid a lot of money to argue about what various clauses and words mean. The definitions frame and define what and whom is covered by various pieces of legislation. Submitters from both sides of this debate were concerned about the lack of clarity in this bill. The specific classic was what defined 'a water resource' under this legislation. Was it any dry gully? Did it refer to any water resource? Apparently, it did. Tracey Winters had this to say:</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">But the effect of this bill is to extend water resources—for example, a dry gully, every dry gully in the country, because a watercourse is defined as every watercourse, whether it is flowing or not. So this bill would make every dry gully in the country a matter of national environmental significance. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Even so, the government's committee report stated that:</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">It is most unlikely that all dry gullies would be included.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">But once it is law, it is law. While Senator Cameron and other senators who support the majority report into this piece of legislation might think that it is enough to put a line in a Senate committee report that it is unlikely that dry gullies would be considered a water resource under this piece of legislation, I would prefer to see that articulated in the bill, because once it is law it is law. I wonder what the perspective of our catchment management authorities, our local farmers and local councils would be if this were the case. I guess we can leave it for the lawyers to sort out.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">

                    <span style="&#xD;&#xA;    font-size:10pt;&#xD;&#xA;  " />There was no clarity either around whom is affected. What do large coalminers look like? A lack of transparency continued about how far the trigger should go. Should it cover other industries? I was particularly interested in this aspect. At the moment it only covered coal seam gas and large coalmining industries but it was of particular concern to the National Farmers Federation that this particular trigger could end up covering other types of regional industries. Apparently, according to Mr Knowles from Economists at Large, it should apply to other industries. It absolutely should. In fact, when he was asked to apply this trigger to agriculture, Mr Knowles said he thought it was a <span style="&#xD;&#xA;    font-family:;&#xD;&#xA;  &#xD;&#xA;    font-size:10pt;&#xD;&#xA;  color:gray;">'logical and equitable approach to take'.</span><span style="&#xD;&#xA;    font-size:10pt;&#xD;&#xA;  "></span><span style="&#xD;&#xA;    font-size:10pt;&#xD;&#xA;  ">The whole push behind this is not just for coal seam gas and large coalmining developments but also for any industry's impact on a water resource, however that is defined. Why should the farmers in Western Australia or South Australia or Victoria or Tasmania be subjected to this ambiguity? Because the government needed once again the political support of Windsor and Waters. This was not one of the recommendations of the Hawke review—the massive review of the EPBC Act. It was not there. The experts did not find it there. It was not part of the government's response to the review. So, the government had the opportunity to say: 'You know what? We think we should do this. We think this should be how the EPBC should look.' </span></span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Did the government put it in their response? No, they did not. I may be cynical! The refusal to work with the states and stakeholders towards an agreed national response to the very real challenges that the coal seam gas industry and its development pose for regional communities changed when the politics changed. Waters and Windsor wanted it as a wedge—that is clear—and Burke brought it on.</span>

Yesterday I listened to Senator Waters talking about food security. The Greens do not care about growing food, and their history proves that. Go back to the Native Vegetation Conservation Act—of which Senator Heffernan would be well aware—which the then Premier of New South Wales, now Senator Bob Carr, brought into New South Wales to stop farmers ploughing even country that had not been farmed for 10 years. They could have grown some wheat crops on it. They could have grown more food. New South Wales could have yielded a lot more food to human consumption. But no—the Native Vegetation Conservation Act brought that to a complete stop, and it was driven by the Greens in the New South Wales parliament. Then Premier Bob Carr said his government would be the greenest New South Wales had ever seen. That he was. He cuddled up to the Greens and put all the environmental costs on to the farmers.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">It is interesting that it was the then minister, one Kim Yeadon—John Laws used to call him by his full name, Kimberley Maxwell Yeadon—one of Premier Carr's senior staffers, who drove the SEPP 46 and then the Native Vegetation Conservation Act, with no compensation to farmers when they could not grow food, driven by the Greens. And who was one of the chief advisers? One Senator Penny Wong. That is where she came from, in her pre-Senate life. This was a Greens-Labor stooge of a policy to blame those terrible farmers, those 'environmental vandals', as they refer to the farmers—who actually feed everyone in Australia plus millions of other people around the world.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I have spent all of my life in rural Australia, and being a member of the National Party of New South Wales I know we are the last people who want to see any damage done to the Liverpool Plains or any other farming country in Australia. There is very little of the sort of magnificent country of the Liverpool Plains, about three per cent, on this planet.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This bill is giving more authority to the federal government, but we on this side of the parliament supported the $150 million scientific study. We actually got the amendments through the Rudd government, from this place—despite the bashing we got from some—that said you could not mine coal seam gas in the Namoi Valley until a water study was carried out. It was the coalition that pursued that and, in conjunction with the Labor Party, we achieved that. So they could not move from exploration to mining without a water study being carried out. It was the Labor Party and the coalition that put that in place. The Greens opposed it because they wanted the water study done before exploration. If that were the case, no exploration would ever be done. Let's be fair dinkum here. The four-wheel-drive utes and tractors that people drive around their farms are not made out of tree bark and leaves; they come from mining. That is why mining has served our country well, as has agriculture. Mining represents a finite resource. Agriculture represents a renewable resource that will hopefully go on for as long as mankind lives on this planet.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">In the normal course of events, the letter having been sent to my electorate office in Brisbane today, it would have been sent overnight for tomorrow. In view of the fact that I wanted to make sure that the record was accurate I asked for leave to make a statement—in the normal course of events I would have brought it to the attention of the Senate after the next question time but that will not be for some time. I thank the Senate for the opportunity to clarify the record.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">It is fair to say that Australians love sport—it is at the centre of our culture and we are indeed a sporting country. We love to play sport, we love to watch sport. From playing backyard cricket at Mum's to packing the stands of the MCG for the AFL grand final, sport is part of the fabric of our lives. It has played an important role in my own life. I vividly remember as a 10-year-old swimming for the Preston swimming club diving into the ice-cold water of the 50-metre outdoor swimming pool on St Georges Road in Preston each Sunday morning, looking at the stopwatch and trying to beat my personal best time. I remember growing up in Reservoir, in the northern suburbs of Melbourne, and the fierce rivalry of the Dredge St versus Tormey St cricket matches. I remember Dad being confused about the strange game of AFL and wanting his boy to play soccer, and cheering from the sidelines during my stint at the North Reservoir soccer club. I remember coming to love that strange game from the moment, downstairs on a fuzzy black-and-white television, I watched my beloved team, the mighty Tigers, thrash Collingwood in the 1980 grand final. It was a journey that led me to play VFA footy, firstly with Coburg—incidentally under the tutelage of Phil Cleary, a former member of this parliament—and later with the Oakleigh football club.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">My football days are over and in my middle age I have discovered other pursuits—the joy of surfing, along with my colleague Senator Whish-Wilson; I cycle when I can; I play a bit of golf; I enjoy the odd game of cricket. When I do roll the arm over it is with the Deans Marsh Swamp Rats who, like many country sporting teams right around regional Australia, are an integral part of the local community. My experience is no different from that of many Australians. It is why we make sport a priority in public policy. The Commonwealth spends over $170 million each year on elite sports through the Australian Institute of Sport, and Australia is famous around the world as a sporting nation. Despite being a small country we are consistently near the top of the Olympic medal tally. Over the years we have been world champions at cricket, we have led the tennis world and we now have an Australian golfing champion in Adam Scott. We have come mighty close to beating the world's best in the game of soccer. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I understand that some people worry that we are a nation that is too obsessed with sport and that this obsession overshadows more important, more noble pursuits such as the arts and sciences.</span>
              </p>

                    <span class="HPS-MemberContinuation">Senator DI NATALE:</span>
                  </a>  Yes, sport is noble and participation in sport brings many good things, such as the tremendous health benefits of physical activity and learning to work in a team environment and to respect rules and the umpire's final decision. Sport is a great leveller. It does not matter who you are or where you come from, sport brings people together to share in the sheer joy of it. That is not to say that we cannot do better to resource and recognise the great achievements of our artists or our scientists. We can and should do both. After all, it was the Greeks who gave us the marathon and the Olympics along with Aristotle, medicine and the foundations of our modern democracy. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Because Australians love sport so passionately, it is big business. Our major sporting codes such as Australian rules football and rugby league have billion-dollar television deals. The Collingwood Football Club alone recorded a profit of almost $8 million last year. The huge profits and increasing professionalism of our major sporting codes have their downsides. Personally, I could do without the hype associated with going to a game of football—overseas imports such as home and away jumpers that change each year just to bring in more revenue and breaks in play being filled with a blast of music over loudspeakers. I find it more than a trifle irritating, and sports like AFL are such great tests of strength, athleticism and endurance that they do not need those sorts of embellishments to survive.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">There has been another much more important, more insidious and more corrosive change to our major sporting codes in recent years. It is now virtually impossible to watch any major sporting contest in this country without being urged to bet on the outcome either during the advertising breaks or by commentators during the event. Statistics reinforce the size and scope of the problem. Online betting, of which sports betting is a major component, has risen from $2.4 billion in 2007 to almost $10 billion in 2012. It is estimated that billions more are wagered by Australians on unregulated, offshore gambling sites.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Until recently gambling was over there; it was the domain of bookies and horse racing; it was done in pokie venues and casinos. But now it is over here; it is everywhere; it is playing an increasing role in our major codes. Because of the potential for harm, there are serious questions to be answered about just how much we want gambling to be part of sport.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I accept that having a bet is part of Australian culture and betting on sport is an enjoyable activity for many people, but for those who become problem gamblers it can be incredibly destructive. It has become increasingly difficult, if not impossible, to avoid repeated exposure to betting advertisements and gambling odds when watching sport. The number of sports betting ads on free-to-air TV quadrupled in the last two years. In 2012, there were 528 different ads collectively broadcast more than 20,000 times.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">There has also been a blurring of the line between commentary and advertising when it comes to gambling. The recent inclusion of a certain ubiquitous bookmaker, who is now appearing on the ground during rugby league coverage, has caused outrage amongst sports fans. Fans of all sports have noticed a growing link between sports and gambling companies. At best, they find it irritating; at worst, they worry about the impact it will have on their kids. This barrage of ads is making parents worried about whether a day at the footy or turning on the rugby is still an appropriate family activity.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">   A recent inquiry by the Joint Select Committee on Gambling Reform looked into the issue. We heard some disturbing evidence. For instance, researchers who interviewed children found that advertising is working on them. Kids can name two or three sports betting companies, those companies whose advertisements they have seen hundreds of times. I have personally heard from parents who have had children write odds onto their own artwork depicting the footy or quote odds before a match. Let us remember this is a product aimed strictly at adults. But the fact that it is worming its way into the consciousness of children has many people worried, including me. I want my kids to be collecting footy cards, not recounting the odds of their favourite player winning the Brownlow Medal. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Gambling is not a harmless product. It is fun for some, but problem gambling costs the community dearly. It destroys lives. It leaves kids unfed, it breaks marriages and homes are lost. For a product with this potential for harm there is a very clear role for government to regulate. I do not propose a ban. I think it is perfectly appropriate that an activity that is so popular remains legal. Banning it would just drive it to unregulated markets overseas or to black markets onshore, leaving those sports open to corruption.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">On the other hand, not regulating it could lead us down a dangerous road. If we do not act now, gambling will become so enmeshed in sport that we will never again separate the two. That can only have one consequence: more problem gamblers. We have tried self-regulation. Nearly two years ago the government gave an ultimatum to the industry regarding the repetition of live odds during sports: 'Either sort yourselves out and curb the practice or the government will act.' A year later, they reached an agreement and broadcasters have since publicised updates to their codes of conduct. These new codes are comical when compared to the extent of the problem. Promotion can continue as before during scheduled breaks; there will still be live betting odds; and, worse still, there is nothing stopping bookmakers and betting company representatives appearing during commentary sections of the broadcast.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal"> These codes do not fix the problem. They allow the nexus between televised sport and gambling to continue its current trajectory—more exposure, more linking, more problem gambling, betting becoming an integral part of the game. The scope of the problem and the path we are on raise real potential for harm to children. We are still gathering evidence but it seems obvious that kids for whom gambling has become a normalised part of life are more likely to gamble later in life. That has been the experience of other harmful products such as tobacco. They will gamble and gamble heavily. Problem gambling behaviour is the inevitable result. That is why the time has come for this parliament to step in, to do something to curb this harm.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The motion before the chamber lists several important reforms that will help mitigate this potential harm. They are simple steps. They will not place an undue burden on industry but will start to disentangle gambling from sport. We must stop the brainwashing of children. Children are not the ostensible targets of gambling ads. The industry claims that they are not trying to recruit new customers from among their ranks. So it is right that children be the first priority of new reforms.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">One obvious reform to prevent the over-exposure of children to these ads is to limit the times at which they may be broadcast. The loophole that allows gambling ads to be broadcast at any time of the day, so long as they are part of a sports broadcast, must be closed. How would we feel if gambling ads popped up during morning cartoons—next to the ads for Barbie dolls and Coco Pops? We would not accept it. But this is the situation we have now when it comes to the broadcast of live sport. The proposal to ban gambling ads before 9 pm is therefore a sensible one. Adults will still see the ads—the industry can continue to advertise—but the number of children exposed to these ads will be significantly reduced.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The broadcast of live odds is one of the most intrusive ways for sports betting companies to promote their service. It is an inducement to gamble right then and there. As I said before, these numbers are noticed by children, many of whom now think that it is just part of the way the game works. There is no reason we should allow this barrage of numbers to continue. Sports betting companies can tell us to have a punt, but they do not need to be listing the odds to do it. So we should stop this practice completely.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The other important and necessary reform is to end so-called 'cash for comment'. The development that has generated the most outrage with sports fans is the inclusion of bookies as part of the editorial team. It must be a lucrative business, because the reaction of fans to the appearance of Tom Waterhouse on the rugby league broadcast was astonishing, It unleashed a torrent of fury. The goodwill this has cost the broadcasters and the sporting code is enormous. Many people have expressed their outrage to me personally and the social media light up any time this happens. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The broadcasters have contended that, by changing the logo on Tom Waterhouse's microphone, the distinction between commentator and sponsor is now crystal clear. But, for a young kid watching a game of footy, Tom Waterhouse the bookmaker is no different from Tom Waterhouse the commentator. When I saw a photograph of Mr Waterhouse signing kids' jerseys after a match, I have to say that was the last straw. The intent of the code is to separate commentary from betting—to separate the commentators from the bookmakers. But children are not equipped to make that distinction. How could they if that sort of sporting broadcast is all they have ever known? It comes on top of the constant repetition of sports betting brand names at every opportune moment in the commentary. We have to stop this practice and we have to start talking about the sport instead of the betting. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The time has come for this parliament to take action. We can very easily legislate to stop this bombardment of betting odds. We can very easily legislate to close the loophole that lets ads run when kids are most likely to be watching. We need to turn sport back over to the experts, to the sports tragics and to the fans and not give it over to the bookmakers and the spruikers. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We are at a crossroad when it comes to sport. If we do not act now, a trip to the footy ground will soon be like a trip to the racetrack. We have the opportunity to take action. These are simple reforms, they are necessary reforms and they are popular reforms. With the stroke of a pen, we can let the sport do the talking and not the bookmakers. By passing legislation to implement these reforms, the parliament would be setting us back on the path to preserving the sports we love.</span>

                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Senator STEPHENS</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">New South Wales</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">16:48</span>):  I congratulate and thank Senator Di Natale for bringing this issue before the Senate. I share his concern about the extent to which the broadcast of live odds for sports betting is becoming an insidious practice. It drives me demented during sports broadcasts, especially during free-to-air television programs on a Sunday afternoon when I am trying to watch my footy team. I totally agree that it is a practice which intrudes on the fun that comes from sitting down with your family and supporting your local team. It certainly takes the notion of betting on two flies on a wall to a whole new level. That is what wagering used to be about, but now it has become a multibillion-dollar global industry that many people cannot resist. It is irritating in the extreme to be constantly bombarded by ads which actively encourage people to bet online or to use their smartphones. As such, it is a practice that I absolutely discourage.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">It also worries me that the broadcast of live odds for sports betting is a honey pot for those who want to exploit athletes or animals or encourage match fixing. Seriously, what does it mean when someone can get live odds on whether the third conversion attempt will be unsuccessful? It is a big temptation for criminals and creates a risk that sporting codes have to get their heads around. Some codes have been dealing with these things for years—fighters taking a dive in the third round, soccer players feigning injury or horses being drenched, as we saw last week in Tamworth. We all recognise how easy it is to exploit such things through dodgy real-time gambling options.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Senator's Di Natale's motion seeks to ban the broadcast of all live odds for sports betting, ban gambling advertising before 9 pm and ban promotion of gambling by commentators during sports broadcasts. But, unfortunately, Senator Di Natale's motion is trying to shut the gate after the horse has bolted, if you will pardon my pun. Parliament and all levels of government have expressed concern to the broadcasting industry, which has finally acknowledged the level of community concern about the promotion of live odds during sporting broadcasts and has agreed to amend their codes of practice. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I think the broadcasting industry has been shamed into action to claw back the leeway it has given to sports betting agencies and to adopt what we have seen in America and some European countries for years. The industry now wants to demonstrate that it can respond through voluntary codes of practice and has agreed that there will be no promotion of live odds by commentators at any time during sports broadcasts </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">There will be no advertising of live odds during play, with clearly identified ads restricted to scheduled breaks in play such as half-time. Let us see if this is enough to curb the blatant behaviour of sports-betting promoters.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">While the broadcasting industry has agreed to this action, I think that the role of government is to acknowledge how gambling is pervasive in our society and to try to address the issue of problem gambling in a more holistic way. In the <span style="font-style:italic;">Monthly</span> magazine, back in 2011, Jonathan Horn wrote:</span>

                <span class="HPS-Small">Neil Evans is the public face of Centrebet. His organisation will accept a bet on pretty much anything. Their federal-election markets garner such coverage that Evans is occasionally referred to as a ‘political analyst’. Centrebet has released markets on the national unemployment rate, the colour of Queen Elizabeth’s hat at her grandson’s wedding, and the World Sauna Championships held in Finland. On the flip side, their plan to offer betting on the permutations of the Australian stock exchange was recently rejected by ASIC.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Small">In March 2008, with James Packer’s Crown Limited bankrolling it, Betfair won a unanimous High Court decision which deemed it unconstitutional to prohibit bookmakers from advertising in one state and operating in another. Suddenly there were no state boundaries, the shackles were off and the land grab was on. “It was the most important thing to happen in 150 years of bookmaking in Australia,” says Betstar’s Alan Eskander. “It kick-started the life-cycle of our industry.”</span>

                <span class="HPS-Small">Their market was voracious, if untapped. Australians are the most fearless gamblers in the world. A recent report in the <span style="font-style:italic;">Economist</span> indicated that, on average, every adult Australian loses just under $1300 per year. As a nation, we drop $22 billion per year on the punt, nearly five times what we spend on foreign aid. “Australians love it,” Eskander says. “It’s how we’ve been brought up, it’s part of our culture, part of our folklore.”</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">In many respects, of course, Mr Eskander is right. We love two-up. Generations of Australians bet on the Melbourne Cup. We take lottery tickets. But what has happened since 2011 has taken betting to a whole new level.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">So what are our responsibilities as legislators? Do we seek to legislate for good behaviour? Do we seek to regulate the industry? Do we seek to ban gambling, driving it underground and back to the good old days of SP bookmakers? Technology will beat us every time if that is the approach we take. We are not a nanny state. We expect people to be responsible for their actions and we acknowledge too that, for people who develop a gambling addiction, we need to take action and provide support. But the sporting bodies, the broadcasters and the gambling industry have an important role to play to ensure our sports do not become swamped with gambling messages, to the point where sport and gambling are seen as one and the same. Just like Senator Di Natale, I have had many, many people contact me about that blurred boundary. No-one wants the conflation of gambling and sport—not the sports, not the Australian government and certainly not the community, which is making it clear that enough is enough. The government is acting to ensure that something is done about it, working with the broadcasters on amendments to the broadcasting industry coregulatory codes of practice, which are enforced by ACMA.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">On 22 June last year, Minister Conroy announced that the government and the commercial and subscription broadcasters had reached an agreement on reducing and controlling the promotion of live betting odds during sports broadcasts, and state and territory governments had committed to looking at the steps they can take to limit promotion of live odds at sporting grounds, such as on scoreboards or by ground announcers. The amendments to the code which have been developed between industry and the government will prohibit commentators from promoting any live odds at all during a broadcast and 30 minutes before or after the match begins and ends. They will restrict the promotion of odds to scheduled breaks in play such as half-time during the rugby or quarter-time in the AFL or at the end of a set of tennis. That means there will be no promotion of live odds when the match is actually in play. The amendments will also provide that the promotion of odds during a scheduled break in the play must be by a clearly distinguishable gambling representative. The proposed amendments to the code were released for public consultation on Monday, 22 April, for a four-week period, so I encourage anyone who has concerns about this to visit the websites of Free TV and ASTRA to have their voices heard, loud and clear.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Since the agreement between the government and the broadcasters last year establishing these principles, broadcasters have largely abided by them, even though the amended codes are not yet in place. That was until, as Senator Di Natale rightly tells us, the Tom Waterhouse advertisements and activities hit our screens with a vengeance this year. When Mr Waterhouse appeared in the first round of the NRL on Nine, I was dumbfounded. This was a step too far, in my view and, from the reaction everywhere else, in the view of most Australians. In his first-round NRL appearance, Waterhouse appeared to be a part of the commentary team and sat on the panel with the other commentators, providing comments on the game itself as well as promoting live odds, and he did not have any visible signs that he was representing Tomwaterhouse.com.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">In March the NRL admitted to the Joint Select Committee on Gambling Reform that 'the lines were a little blurred' in that incident. A little blurred indeed! The NRL's General Manager of Strategic Projects, Mr Mattiske, conceded that it was hard to tell whether or not Mr Waterhouse was part of the commentary team, and he said changes had now been made. He said:</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Small">… it is plain that, in the first round of the competition, the lines were a little blurred. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">But:</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Small">… now… there is a very clear distinction between the commentary team and the promotion of sports betting.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Another witness to the inquiry said that Mr Waterhouse:</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Small">… now appears alone. There is a Tom Waterhouse microphone and big logo on the screen saying that he's an online bookmaker. … There is a significant change in the format of that.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I wonder if that is going to be enough. The broadcasting industry and the sports industry are very keen to try to take further action to amend the code and to try to use a mandatory process to do that. The government, I think, are taking this view: to give credit where it is due, where the industry has said it is going to take action we will wait and see how these codes work before we consider to rush to legislate. There could be a role, too, for state and territory governments to place similar restrictions on other forms of advertising within their jurisdictions—as I said before, such as the promotion of live odds at the sporting grounds or during sporting events. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">But it should be even easier for the public to find information about that code of conduct. For example, it could be advertised on TV channels during the sports broadcasts and, while it is important that the public has an adequate opportunity to comment on the code, it is also important to make sure that those comments, and any expressions of concern, are not simply recorded but are actually addressed—that action is taken or change is made to the code to address community concern.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I go back to Senator Di Natale's question: can a 12-year-old distinguish between a sports commentator and Tom Waterhouse talking about the game? I do not think that many young kids can, and I would like to see that—as Mr Mattiske said, in answer to a question asked of him by Senator Xenophon about whether there was a conflict of interest in brokering a deal with Mr Waterhouse while at the same time trying to regulate sports gambling—'The integrity of the competition is our utmost priority. We would not allow any arrangements to threaten that.'</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">In fact, what we do know is that that activity by Mr Waterhouse would have been a breach of two of the restrictions in the code once it was implemented: the restriction on commentators and their guests promoting live odds; and the requirement for live odds to be promoted, when permitted, by a clearly distinguishable representative of a gambling organisation. As Minister Conroy said to the industry in 2011: lift your game; we are going to take action on this. And the broadcasters and the sports, to their credit, have responded to that. So what we want to see—and these are the changes to the codes that have been proposed and are being consulted on right now—is that commentators spruiking live odds, or gambling advertisements displaying the odds on television of who will kick the next goal after the last one was scored, cannot creep back into sports broadcasts.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">It is an insidious change to the way in which we all think about community sports in Australia. It is an insidious and insulting change. It is one that I think threatens the way in which Australians react to their community sports and it is something that the government is very keen to ensure is eliminated. But we do not support the notion of actually legislating this ban.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Senator Di Natale's proposal, which goes to the issue of banning the advertising of sports betting services on television and radio during children's viewing hours before 9 pm, does actually go to prime-time television sports broadcasts, and therefore is something that we cannot support. We will watch and wait and ensure that the voluntary codes that are being proposed and entered into by the broadcasting industry are actually activated and that they are effective.</span>

                  <a href="KO6" type="MemberSpeech">
                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Senator HUMPHRIES</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Australian Capital Territory</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">17:03</span>):  I want to make a brief contribution to this debate, in the light of the fact that other senators wish to also speak. I want to make the point that the coalition shares some of the concerns that Senator Di Natale has placed on the table about the pervasiveness and effect of gambling, particularly sports betting, on Australian society. We acknowledge that there is a proportion of the community which will be susceptible to messages about gambling which will lead them to make decisions unhealthy for themselves and their families. As a community, we need to be cognisant of that harm, we need to be able to develop a response to that harm and we need to constructively change the environment in which that harm occurs so as to minimise the likelihood that people are placed in that position.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Having said that, like Senator Stephens, who has spoken in this debate already, we share a sense of concern at the response exhibited in this motion by the Greens to simply regulate this area in order to be able to solve this problem. It seems to be the case with the Australian Greens that there is no social problem too big or too small that is not capable of being remedied or cured with a healthy dose of regulation.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We acknowledge that sometimes some regulation is necessary, but we take the view that the case needs to be made, based on evidence, for that to occur. With great respect, Senator Di Natale in this debate has not demonstrated that case. He has pointed to a number of attempts that have been made in the Australian community to rectify these problems, but he is happy to dismiss those as being ineffective, even though—for example, in the case of the gambling industry's own attempts at self-regulation, only recently beefed up—the evidence is not yet available as to whether that is an effective means of dealing with these problems.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The Greens, I think it is fair to say, from the very outset of this debate have supported and promoted regulation as almost the first line of defence or the first line of attack in this area, and they are prepared to ensure that that agenda is prosecuted, notwithstanding the lack of evidence that it may be the solution to these problems. I say this as a representative of a party which has a proud record of action in the area of regulating, if necessary, to prevent social harm. Indeed, it was the Howard government which first regulated the effect of the operation of online gambling on Australian society. Indeed, when it made those decisions to regulate online gambling, it was the first government in the world to regulate online gambling—to the extent that that is possible. I believe it is appropriate for us to consider steps like that, based on evidence—not based on an impulse to want to impose rules on communities that otherwise may be able to find solutions to problems that afflict them and their customers.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Only a little over a year ago the coalition released a discussion paper on gambling reform, which made a number of important suggestions about ways of improving the response to harm in the Australian community relating to gambling. One of those suggestions was to do with restricting access to live betting odds—action which has, of course, since been taken up by the industry through self-regulation. Senator Di Natale, in his remarks, I think somewhat underplayed the extent to which the industry itself has been prepared to pick up these issues and address them through a self-regulatory approach, backed by ACMA, the communications agency, to make sure that there is an effective means of protecting the Australian community.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">In the course of his remarks, Senator Di Natale made the point that a licensed person can come on air, during a live-broadcast game, and announce odds. Senator Di Natale would perhaps not be aware that the recent draft code of practice that has been developed by the industry—by the industry, not by government—has made it very clear that that cannot occur. The code allows for licensed people to make announcements about betting odds before a game, or during scheduled breaks, but not while a game is in play. That, again, is an initiative of the industry itself.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Senator Di Natale's motion makes reference to the need to ensure that we ban 'the paid promotion of sports betting services by sporting commentators and their guests during sports broadcasts'. He may also not be aware that the code makes it clear that the commentators cannot make such comments.</span>

                    <span class="HPS-MemberContinuation">Senator HUMPHRIES:</span>
                  </a>  I will do my very best, Mr Acting Deputy President. So the very issues that Senator Di Natale raises in his motion are in fact being addressed by the Australian sports betting industry. And so it should, because this industry depends upon a measure of goodwill by the Australian community, by the punters who participate in these services, and I believe they want to play in a way which gives people a sense that they are honourable and decent players in a marketplace. I would submit that it is in their interests that they provide for that kind of self-regulation where appropriate, and I believe that is what they are attempting to do.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I note that the draft code of practice, which I referred to a moment ago, is presently out for public comment. The opportunity for public comment closes on 21 May—next week. Once a code of practice through that process is determined then it has to be registered by ACMA. So, again, it is an initiative of the industry but it has the backing of Australia's media regulator—and that is an appropriate arrangement.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Senator Di Natale made reference in his speech to the corrosive effect of sports betting and advertising of sports betting odds to children. I would agree with him that we need to take special care to ensure that children are not adversely impacted by such advertising. But, again, I think we need to be careful not to exaggerate the effect of that kind of phenomenon. Information presented to the recent inquiry into gambling reform by Free TV suggested that children aged between five and 17 made up less than 12 per cent of the total viewing audience of any of the top-10 sporting events in 2012, excluding the Olympic broadcasts. Of those children who were watching, the majority were co-viewing with an adult—around eight in 10 in the five-to-12 age group—so there is an opportunity there for parental guidance of children who might see that kind of advertising.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">ASTRA, representing the pay-TV industry, in its own submission to that inquiry said that, on the basis of evidence they were able to produce, children under 18 comprised a very small proportion of the audience for live sporting events on subscription TV. They said  that, of the 50 most-watched live sports broadcasts shown on STV in 2012, children under 18 comprised just 11.3 per cent of the total combined audience for those broadcasts, with less than one-third of those—or 2.3 per cent of the total audience—being children under 18 watching without an adult present.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Now, I accept that that still represents a large number of children who may be exposed to this kind of harm but, as is always the case, it is important to make sure that we do not deal with the problem in a disproportionate way. The restriction on the freedom to impart information to people able to maturely and carefully accept and use that information is a right that people have—one we should be very careful to withdraw merely because we have identified that some people may suffer some harm from that fact.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The coalition, as I have said, has demonstrated a concern about this by putting together a discussion paper from its working party. The working group on coalition reform has that information available online, and I suggest that those people who are looking for some innovative approaches look at that report. We welcome recent moves by the commercial television and radio industries, and the subscription television industry, to address community concerns regarding live odds in sports through a revised code of practice which prohibits the promotion of live odds while a sporting event is in play. The code deserves to be considered by the public, and for comment to be made and considered, before a final version of the code is promulgated.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We take concerns about the promotion of live sports odds very seriously. We are concerned about making sure that children are protected, but we also believe it is important not to rush to conclusions. With the greatest of respect, the motion that Senator Di Natale has put forward today does rush to a conclusion before all the evidence is available. The coalition would not support the motion which is before the Senate tonight.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">
                  <a href="195565" type="MemberSpeech">
                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Senator WHISH-WILSON</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Tasmania</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">17:15</span>):  I will speak only for a short period of time tonight because I respect that there is a large list of speakers who are very passionate about this issue and would like to talk on it tonight. It is interesting—Senator Stephens talked about Australian culture, and there is no doubt that having a punt and having a bet is synonymous with Australian culture. Probably the best book I have ever read on Australian culture, and possibly one of the best books ever written in this country, is <span style="font-style:italic;">Cloudstreet</span>,<span style="font-style:italic;"></span>by Tim Winton. Just about everyone in this chamber has probably read it. I certainly hope they have. It is a fascinating book. It is a juxtaposition of two families—the Lambs family and the Pickles family. Sam Pickles, a man who loses his hand, is a really interesting character to follow in the book. Essentially his life is a constant struggle against a gambling addiction. It is fascinating to read about his gambling addiction. It is an addiction which so many Australians suffer from, and it is quite easy to understand why.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">It suggests that a person will only get control over their gambling when they have started to make progress in working on the big worries in their lives, such as boredom, failure et cetera. It also suggests that a lot of Australians have strong values of not giving up easily and not quitting when the going gets tough and also have very strong competitive drives. These factors tend to work against problem gamblers, leading them to keep going until all their money is gone. The interesting thing about <span style="font-style:italic;">Cloudstreet </span>is that what Sam Pickles used to look forward to was when the races occurred. That stimulus was what he required in his life. We know it is the same with the pokies. The stimulus that drives the problem of addiction to pokies is the noise, the flashing lights and so on.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The stimulus is obvious when you think about online gambling, but the next phase is to see gambling on television, in an area of content that Australians love and are totally attached to, including children, which is sports games. Why are we so fascinated with sport? It is a big part of our culture. Most of us grow up playing sport. If you have an addiction then it is quite obvious that while you are watching sports games it is going to be very hard to get away from that addiction and that stimulus is going to be in front of you the whole time.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I have discovered a couple of interesting things about sports gambling which suggest that it is possibly going to be an even more pervasive problem than other types of gambling, such as casino gambling. There was a really good article recently in LiveScience by Professor Ghose. He talks about a large study done by Tel Aviv University in Israel, and quotes from a statement by a study co-author:</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Small">"Sports gamblers seem to believe themselves the cleverest of all gamblers. They think that with experience and knowledge—such as player's statistics, manager's habits, weather conditions and stadium capacity—they can predict the outcomes of a game better than the average person,"</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">He goes on to explain a very large study that he did in the UK around soccer. In the end he came to some startling conclusions:</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Small">"Casino gamblers are more appropriately characterised as obsessives, because they have less belief in themselves, and know that they will lose sooner or later. But they gamble anyway because they feel they need to," Dannon said.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Small">By contrast, sports gamblers may need tailored cognitive therapy that rids them of the belief that they have more control over the outcome than they really do. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I was interested in that conclusion, so I went looking for real-life examples of severe problem addiction with sports gambling.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Probably the best story that I read was an article from the Roar, 'How sports gambling cost me love'. It was by Hayley Byrnes, who was married to a rugby league player. She talks about the culture within sport of sports players being addicted to sports gambling. She said:</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Small">I personally have spent the darkest of hours with a sports gambling addict. Without delving into too much personal detail out of respect to this person, I can however say that for over four years I battled weekly with a live in boyfriend’s gambling addiction.In the end we both lost.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">

                <span class="HPS-Small">It wasn't until one night in bed after a few weeks of living together with my partner that I started to have any indication there could be trouble in paradise. As we lay in bed, he sat up next to me, eyes fixed on the laptop.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Small">"What are you doing on that so late?" I mumbled.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Small">"Oh just watching a tennis bet," he replied. 3am rolled around and he was still up, eyes glued to that screen watching live tennis scores like a heroin addict waiting for his next delivery.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The article goes on to say that eventually this couple did seek therapy. In that therapy, after not talking for the first two therapy sessions, her partner talked about the very first time that he gambled:</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Small">… as a 16-year-old kid he was led into the TAB by fellow teammates, unbeknownst to him at the time that one bet would cost him his football career, friendships and his first love.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">It was a very compelling story about real lives.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I think Senator Humphries said gambling causes 'some' harm. I think even single individuals and single lives being ruined by gambling addiction is a lot of harm. There is plenty of evidence to show that there is more than some harm in our community. The risks are very real that we might see gambling addiction normalised, especially if we see it in sports advertising, which kids can watch. I want to use the word 'stimulus' again, because that is what we know drives, or certainly helps facilitate, gambling addiction. On television at quarter time, at half-time, after the game and of course before the game, there is the temptation, the stimulus, to get people interested in laying a bet, in gambling. I do not have the compulsion myself, and I know lots of people who have healthy habits in terms of laying bets. But addiction, whether it is gambling, alcohol or heroin, is all the same. It is a physiological problem that is very difficult for people to combat and it takes a lot of effort to overcome.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We talk about the need for regulation. It is my understanding that the voluntary code on odds has been in place now for a couple of months and—let's make this very clear—it has been complied with. We recognise that, but the problem is still there. Nothing has changed. The advertising is still there and the odds are still there. Online betting has risen from $2.4 billion spent in 2007 to almost $10 billion in 2012. In 2012, 528 individual ads were put forward which were collectively broadcast more than 20,000 times. This is big money. The TV rights for AFL is big money—it is huge money. Why do TV companies pay big money? It is obvious: they want eyeballs on the screen. What comes with eyeballs? Ratings. What comes with ratings? Advertising spend. This is all about how TV broadcasters can get advertising spend. It is obvious that, when there is a new, developing market out there—online gambling and sports gambling especially—tied directly to individual sports programs, it is going to be a big market and there is going to be lots of money in it.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">My experience with large profits being available to both broadcasters and betting companies is that it spells trouble in terms of regulation, particularly self-regulation. Even the Liberal Party, who understand free-market economics, must recognise that there is a role for government to play when markets fail. One way we classically talk about market failure is when there are costs associated with a particular business activity. The costs associated with gambling are severe in lots of different areas when it comes to its impact on our community. We have looked at it right across the board. Where we see these costs associated with a productive activity, in this case a service, the government has a role to make sure those costs are minimised or those companies pay for those costs.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">That is certainly not the Greens' understanding of the system at present, and that is why this motion has been moved by Senator Di Natale—to take very strong action and to not rely on a voluntary code that we do not believe has worked. It is time for regulation. We believe banning all live sporting odds is very important. We also believe that advertising should occur after 9 pm, when we know most children will not be watching advertising. We want to avoid this problem being normalised. We certainly want to see a ban on cash for comment, which, once again, to use Senator Stephens's comment, blurs the lines between what is sport and what is gambling. That is something we certainly cannot afford to introduce into our culture in this country.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Queensland</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">17:25</span>):  I rise this evening also to speak on this notice of motion on sports betting reform. In his introduction, Senator Di Natale hit the nail on the head when he said that Australians love sport. That is pretty well right—we love our sport. What goes with sport in Australia? Australians love a flutter. They love a bet. You know, Mr Acting Deputy President, that in the next couple of weeks the greatest game of all, the State of Origin, will be played between New South Wales and that great state of Queensland.</span>

                    <span class="HPS-MemberContinuation">Senator FURNER:</span>
                  </a>  I do have some friends—as well as some of the people who work around this place and some of my staff, because it is in the nature of Australians to have a harmless flutter. But what has been raised tonight is correct: the addictions need to be recognised, when people take their gambling habits way too far. Both the Greens senators and Senator Stephens, I think, earlier indicated the problem with gambling in this country. Problem gamblers lose on average $21,000 a year. You would wonder how they can survive in their households or their communities with those sorts of losses in a year. That is why this government is acting decisively on this issue.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The government is taking action to reduce the promotion of live odds during sports coverage. Working with the broadcasting industry, we have proposed amendments to their codes of practice. Under those principles agreed between industry and the government, there will not be promotion of live odds by commentators at any time during a sports broadcast. That is what is being proposed, will be implemented and, I am convinced, will be successful in addressing this issue with live odds during sports coverage. There will also be no advertising of live odds during play, with clearly identified ads restricted to scheduled breaks in play, such as half-time. The government preference generally is for action to be taken through the co-regulatory framework to broadcasting regulation. For now, the government will evaluate the effectiveness of measures proposed by the broadcasting industry before considering any further action such as legislation in this space. For this reason, we do not support the Greens' motion at this time.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The government recognises that problem gambling and the relationship between sport and gambling is a serious issue. We have acted and we continue to act across a range of portfolios to address this issue. We understand the concerns in the community that Senator Di Natale proposes to address and has raised here this evening. Sporting bodies, broadcasters and the gambling industry all have an important role to play to ensure our sports do not become swamped with gambling messages to the point where sport and gambling are seen as one and the same. No-one wants that—not the community, not the sports and not the Australian government. So, once again, under the principles agreed between industry and the government, there will be no promotion of live odds by commentators at any time during a sports broadcast.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">More broadly, this government has legislated to reform poker machine regulation. As we know, the legislation requires precommitment technology to be available on every one of Australia's 200,000 poker machines, introduces a voluntary precommitment system to help players set limits and keep track of their spending, and introduces a maximum daily withdrawal limit of $250 on ATMs in gaming venues. The government's minister, Senator Conroy, in March of 2013 responded to the review of the act that governs online gambling: the Interactive Gambling Act 2001. He has committed to the development of a national standard for harm minimisation and consumer protection for online gambling. He is working with the states and territories on a harmonised approach to regulating in this space.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Government has acted to stamp out match-fixing in sport. In 2011, the Gillard government reached an agreement with states and territories to introduce a national policy on match-fixing in sports. The government recognises that problem gambling is a serious issue, which is why we support responsible advertising by broadcasters and industry. That is why we have taken action to ensure that the promotion of live odds in sports broadcasts is reduced and controlled. The promotion of live odds during sporting events is unacceptable. The Commonwealth government has taken action to reduce and control the promotion of live betting odds during sport coverage.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The federal government has worked with the broadcasters on amendments to the broadcasting industry co-regulatory codes of practice, which are enforced by the ACMA. On 29 June 2012, the Minister for Broadband, Communications and the Digital Economy announced that the Australian government had secured an agreement with commercial and subscription broadcasters to reduce and control the promotion of live betting odds during sports broadcasts. State and territory governments have also committed to look at the steps. They could take on a limited promotion of live odds on sporting grounds, such as on scoreboards or by ground announcers. People do not want odds shoved in their face when watching sport, and that is where these new restrictions address this issue.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">This agreement, which was struck last year, forms the basis upon which the broadcasters have promised amendments to their codes of practice. Looking at how the proposed amendments restrict the promotion of live odds, the amendments to the code will prohibit commentators from promoting any live odds at all during the broadcast and 30 minutes before and after the match begins and ends. It will restrict the promotion of odds to scheduled breaks that are played during a sporting event, such as: half-time at the rugby, quarter-time at the AFL or at the end of a set in tennis. This means there will be no promotion of live odds when the match is actually in play. That is the last thing I want to see during a State of Origin match. It will also provide the promotion of odds during a scheduled break in play, where it will be clearly distinguished by gaming representatives.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Since the agreement between the government and the broadcasters in June last year that established these principles, broadcasters have largely abided by them—although the amended codes are not yet in place, with the exception of the Tom Waterhouse incidents. The amendments to the codes have been proposed by the broadcasters and were released for public consultation on Monday, 28 April for a period of four weeks. We encourage interested members of the public to go to the websites of the peak bodies for broadcasting Free TV, ASTRA and pay TV to find out more. If people choose, they can make a written submission to express their views on the proposed amendments. The amendments will then be submitted to the ACMA and, if approved, will be registered and enforced by the regulator.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The radio industry, through Commercial Radio Australia, publicly released its proposed amendments for comment in December last year. The consultation window for CRA's amendments has now closed. So the government's preference, in general, is for action to be taken through a co-regulatory framework for broadcasting regulation.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">

                  <a href="8IV" type="MemberSpeech">
                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Senator XENOPHON</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">South Australia</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">17:33</span>):  I am grateful to Senator Back for giving me this opportunity to speak. I promise to keep it down to eight minutes; I will do my very best to keep it within eight minutes. I support Senator Di Natale's motion and congratulate him for bringing it on. This proposal, in the bill that he has introduced recently, mirrors many of the proposals that I put in a bill that I introduced in this chamber in June 2011—the more, the merrier. To me, it will be a great day when we have a bill from either the coalition or the government, or both, mirroring what Senator Di Natale is trying to do and what I have been trying to do. It is because enough is enough: we have gone too far in relation to this.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">This is a very serious issue. I refer members to the evidence given by Associate Professor Samantha Thomas, from the University of Wollongong. She is an expert researcher, who has researched the impact of this sort of pernicious, insidious gambling advertising on children. Her studies and surveys are extensive. In a snapshot: parents are concerned that kids are talking about the odds and not the games. There is an increase of embedded memories, if you like, of advertising, where kids remember it. That is very disturbing. That kids are able to recall the brand name of gambling companies—children who are six, eight, 10 or 12 years old—is very disturbing.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We also have a situation with young men, where odds talk is being embedded into conversations as part of the culture. Young men feel pressured into gambling because of this pernicious advertising. Gambling is now part of the peer group: if they do not participate in it, they are not part of that group. That is sickening. Let us clear this up once and for all—and perhaps Senator Di Natale will have an opportunity to sum up the debate: the new whiz-bang proposed code, which is being proposed now, still allows for advertising before the game, of odds being spruiked before the game and at quarter-time, half-time, three-quarter time and after the game. It just stops those live odds. It is better than nothing—it is better than a kick in the head—but it does not deal with the issue, which is that we are being bombarded with gambling advertising. You will still be able to see the ads for the various gambling companies—Sportsbet, Sportingbet, Tom Waterhouse or whomever—during a game. Kids can see that as well.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">That is very, very important. We must tackle this. What I proposed back in 2011, and what Senator Di Natale is proposing now, is not extra regulation, as Senator Humphries has characterised it. It is about closing a loophole. Currently, under the Commercial Television Code of Practice, the situation is that you cannot have gambling advertising during G-rated periods, but there is an exemption for news, current affairs and sporting programs. It is for sporting programs where the greatest impact is felt. This is about closing a loophole. You should not have the odds being broadcast and you should not have gambling advertising during G-rated periods. This is the fundamental issue.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">There is an inquiry about this. It is public knowledge that there is an attempt to get Tom Waterhouse to appear before the inquiry. I cannot comment to say anything other than that, but I would welcome him appearing. I would like to take a moment or two to quote what former Wallabies great, author and commentator Peter FitzSimons said in his column on 24 April in the <span style="font-style:italic;">Sydney Morning Herald</span>. It is headed 'Waterhouse's submission is a joke that's not funny'. I will just quote a few paragraphs from that. It starts off with Mr FitzSimons saying:</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Small">Bring it in tight, Tom Waterhouse. Yes, yes, yes, it is me again, and no, I don't have particularly hard feelings because you're suing me for defamation at the moment. Nothing personal, what?</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Small">Nevertheless, because of that legal action, I have of course tried to temper my remarks when it comes to your statement to the joint select committee on gambling reform on Tuesday, where you robustly defended your ubiquitous presence on sports broadcasts across Australia, asserting your right to flog your sports betting operation as you please.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Small">So let me, as delicately as I can muster, as carefully as possible, choose my words delicately ... with malice towards none ... with charity to all:</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Small">If you wrote the statement to the select committee, give yourself an uppercut. If someone wrote it for you, pretend you're Mark Bouris on Celebrity Apprentice and say loudly: "You're fired."</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Small">In that statement, you say you have, "No intention of targeting children through our advertising ..."</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Small">What are the kids then? Collateral damage? Whether or not the kids are specifically "targeted" by your company is hardly the point? The point is that they ARE hit, regardless. The point is that while the government has the brains to have a ban on gambling advertising on programs children are likely to be watching, there remains the ludicrous exception of sport, which millions of Australian kids watch for hours on end!</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Small">The point is that because of this exposure gambling chat in the playground is now endemic, and many young Australians think that gambling is glamorous instead of the brain-dead loser pursuit it actually is. So you didn't specifically target them? So what?The outcome is equally devastating—a time-bomb that will go off when they have more than their lunch money to lose.</span>
              </p>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">I congratulate Peter FitzSimons for those comments which reflect the overwhelming opinion out there in the community.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I spoke to Peter FitzSimons about his columns. He gets overwhelmed by the number of comments and people writing in to him or tweeting him. There is a strong, visceral community reaction to this. There is a revulsion about the way the odds are being rammed down our throats. When six-, eight- and 10-year-olds are talking to their parents in their homes about the odds and not about the game then you know we have gone too far. That is why we need to ban gambling advertising during G-rated periods.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I note what has been said about overregulation. But in May of last year I did a joint press conference with the opposition leader, Tony Abbott. I was very happy to do that joint press conference with him on the issue of online gambling. Statements that the opposition leader made about how we have gone too far were a very pleasing development. I disagree with the opposition leader on his stance on poker machine reform, but we have a lot of common ground in terms of online gambling. I do not think that what this motion is about, what my bill in 2011 was about or what Senator Di Natale's recently introduced bill was about is that far away from the comments of the opposition leader. The opposition leader's comments are very much in line with overwhelming community opinion.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We have had enough. Leave kids alone, for goodness' sakes. We have a ban on G-rated programs having gambling advertising, but there is an exemption for sporting programs. Let us close that exemption down. If the opposition and the government will not come on board, that is fine because I will make sure right up until 14 September, election day, that this is an issue. I will thank you both for giving me an issue to fight the election on. But I would rather it not be an issue. I would rather there be some unanimity in this chamber to reflect the overwhelming community opinion that we need to do something about what has become an insidious activity that is damaging our kids. Give us a break. Let's support a ban on gambling advertising and on the odds being pushed down our throats so that we can protect our kids.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Western Australia</span>—<span class="HPS-MinisterialTitles">Deputy Opposition Whip in the Senate</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">17:41</span>):  I appreciate the opportunity to comment on the motion put by Senator Di Natale. I have listened very carefully to the comments around the chamber. There is absolutely no difficulty. There is a unanimous view from everybody that we do not want to see a circumstance in which children are placed at risk.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">However, recognition has not been given, in my view, by Senator Di Natale or Senator Xenophon to the voluntary action by those who actually produce and present this type of material. I speak, of course, of the draft code of practice regarding the promotion of live odds in sports coverage. We have a circumstance in which that document is out for public comment at this very moment. I do not know how many comments there have been, but I understand that it closes for comment on 21 May, which is only the beginning of next week. So we should have information very, very quickly as to what the reaction of the public is to the voluntary code that has been put into place by those, both from Free TV and subscription television, who actually present sports broadcasting to the Australian community.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I would just like to reflect for a moment on what the size of the audience is—the size of the audience of children under the age of 18. This was advice presented to the Joint Select Committee on Gambling Reform this year by those two groups—Free TV and ASTRA. The Free TV figures are that around 12 per cent of the audience at home watching TV are between the ages of five and 17, with the balance being adults. Interestingly enough, between 70 per cent and 80 per cent of those children under the age of 17 are in the company of adults. The figures presented by the other organisation, ASTRA, were very similar.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Gambling is something which I am not associated with. I was involved in the horseracing industry for many, many years as a veterinary surgeon. Senator Mason would be interested to know that very early in my career an old fellow said to me, 'Chris, the only way you will make money following horses is with a broom and shovel.' I took that on board and I believed it, and I am very happy to say that neither my wife and I nor any member of our family is afflicted.</span>

                  </a>  I went into politics, but it took me some years, Senator Mason, before I did. The point I want to make very, very strongly is that there is a responsibility of parents and of carers toward the attitudes, the actions and the behaviours of children. I disagree with Senator Di Natale, because we are not going to wipe out this risk to children by totally banning—certainly until nine o'clock at night—the advertising of sports betting services on television and radio. In my view there is a responsibility of carers, of adults, of parents, of grandparents and of those responsible for children's behaviours and attitudes to influence them in relation to the wider community. We are assaulted these days, as you know, with vast media. We have smart phones, and people can gamble in any location using their smart phones. The other point that I want to make in relation to that comment is that there is not only online gambling in Australia but also operations overseas, which the Australian government has limited capacity to regulate.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Having been a member of the gambling reform committee from the time it was established, when Mr Wilkie originally sought the agreement of the Prime Minister to put it in place—and Senator Xenophon has always been active and involved in that—I have had it brought home to me, and my experience tells me, that if you deny people one form of gambling, if they want to gamble, they will find another way. The last thing we want is for people to be participating in uncontrolled, internet accessed gambling overseas where we have no control at all. We have no knowledge of where these participants are and we have no capacity as an Australian community to protect them. Of course nobody wants to see problem gambling in adults and we certainly do not want to see it in children.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">I support that 100 per cent as I am sure others do. I have heard Senator Di Natale and Senator Xenophon question it and say that it is irrelevant because there is quarter time and half time in the case of Australian Rules and three-quarter time and half time in the other code north of the border. The simple fact of the matter is that, as we all know, during those periods of time in the household, or wherever else sport might be watched, it is the case that people move around, go out to get a drink, go to the toilet, or converse, and that may well be the time in which they discuss what the progress of the game is. For us to stand up here and support a total ban does not make common sense to me.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Of course, it is not just the voluntary code that will come into operation. Once it is in its final form it will be the subject of review and will then be the subject of registration by the Australian Communications and Media Authority, ACMA. It may be into the future—through you, Mr Acting Deputy President, to Senator Di Natale—that over time this is not seen to have achieved its goal or been strong enough in its objectives. Let us not rush into this. This is the best situation at the moment, in which industry has voluntarily, at short notice, determined to put this code of practice into place.</span>

The coalition, of course, have a proud record when it comes to being the first to legislate to control online gambling in this country. As my colleague Senator Humphries said, we were the first in the world to so do. We are not blind to where the responsibility lies or where the opportunities lie. I say in conclusion—to allow colleagues the opportunity to comment—that I do not support the motion but certainly, as Senator Xenophon quite rightly said in reflecting his comments with our leader Mr Abbott, 'It is an issue which definitely requires control. Children have to be protected, but we have not yet got to the nanny state.'</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">South Australia</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">17:50</span>):  I rise to make a contribution in this debate. I listened carefully to the outline of the issue from Senator Di Natale in relation to the outrage amongst sports fans. I cannot entirely agree with that. In my own household at least one non-sports fan does not like it, but, whenever I am enjoying a barbecue and watching the football, most of the other people are quite interested—but they are adults.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The argument is that there is a barrage of ads, disturbing evidence that kids can identify sports betting agencies and that the consciousness of children is being altered or informed. Well, that is just a very successful advertising campaign. That happens with breakfast cereals and with Coca-Cola, and it happens with everything.  So I do not think you can say that sports betting is the cause of their altered consciousness; it is advertising that does it. The reality is that we will have a whole generation growing up in front of very large, interactive smart TVs with smart phones. Prohibition is not the way forward. We are a nation that stops for Melbourne Cup Day. There are sweeps in every school, in every workplace and in almost every household.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">As Senator Stephens said, we are a nation of voracious gamblers. We do have a significant number of problem gamblers and we do not want to increase that number of problem gamblers. We certainly do not want to encourage children to commence betting below the legal age or to have an appetite for betting. But, if you have ever taken your son to the Rugby League or the football, you would know that tickets have always been sold on the first try-scorer. You bought your ticket—in those days it might have cost 20c—and if you had the right number you won a prize: a meat tray or whatever. This type of betting on sports has been around. What we are experiencing now is the insidious nature of technology. We have smart phones and smart apps—download a smart app, get Tom Waterhouse on your iPhone or your other type of smart phone.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I understand the sincerity that, in particular, Senator Xenophon brings to the debate. He is absolutely right: he will campaign until there is no breath left in his body on these issues, because that is in his nature and that has certainly been his demonstrated track history. The reality is that we need to look at what the government is actually doing. The government is indeed taking action to reduce the promotion of live odds during sports coverage. We are working with the broadcasting industry who have proposed amendments. They have responded to community concerns. They have a very big and growing business. In their view, they have to get their act together, otherwise legislation could be introduced that will restrict their opportunity, but I do not believe they are out there trying to get kids to bet. I certainly do not believe that.</span>
              </p>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">Under principles agreed between the industry and the government, there will be no promotion of live odds by commentators at any time during a sports broadcast. There will be no advertising of live odds during play, with clearly identified ads restricted to scheduled breaks in play, such as at half-time. The government's preference in general is for action to be taken through the co-regulatory framework of broadcasting regulation. For now, the government will evaluate the effectiveness of the measures proposed by the broadcasting industry before considering any further action, such as this type of legislation. In this space and for this reason we do not support, and I do not support, the Greens bill at this time. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The government recognises that problem gambling and the relationship between sport and gambling are very serious issues. We have acted and continue to act across a range of portfolios to address these issues. The concern that has been expressed here today, targeted towards one particular betting agency because he is the most highly visible agency and has made a real success of his business in a very short space of time, is probably flawed. We need to address the fundamentals.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I do not mind if my grandchildren learn about betting, because if you learn about betting you basically learn about losing. You do not get odds of 10 to one because it is a sure thing. You get odds of 10 to one because there is a nine times chance of losing. I do not think you can hide people, children or otherwise, away from the real world and then at the age of 18 turn them out for someone else to cultivate into a gambler. I do not mind having exposure at the right times. I do not think it is appropriate before the PG sort of rating period. I do not think we should be advertising gambling, as someone has already said in the debate, in the cartoon hours, but there is no doubt that kids will be watching football and nine o'clock is not going to stop them from watching football. If a game is scheduled to go a bit later, there are plenty of households in which children below the age of 18 or below the age of 10 do not go to bed until midnight. There are plenty of households which are fanatical about the round-ball game. A lot of that is played in the middle of the night. I do not think an arbitrary curfew is the answer to this. I think education is the answer. I am not all that convinced that this exposure is 100 per cent detrimental. It may be detrimental to a certain number of very vulnerable people, but they will probably have that vulnerability with or without this type of activity by betting agencies.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Sporting bodies, broadcasters and the gambling industry all have an important role to play to ensure that our sports do not become swamped with gambling messages. At the end of the day, you want to see your team win. If you happen to bet on the way through and you are of a legal age, I do not have a problem with that. I do not think any government will ever change that ability. If you are of a legal age, your team is in the running and you want to have a punt, it will be available to you. What has attempted to be the subject of this debate is whether we have a younger and more vulnerable group of consumers who have been groomed and turned into problem gamblers. I do not think there is any evidence to say that is the case.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I heard Senator Back's story about growing up in Kalgoorlie. I grew up in the Northern Territory. Someone else mentioned that two flies could be bet on. I am certain that there have been occasions when I have been tempted to bet on one of those flies. It has not made me a problem gambler, it has not made my children problem gamblers and I do not have any friends or family who have turned into problem gamblers, and we have had exposure to gambling—of a legal nature and perhaps of a more dubious nature—throughout all our growing up years.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">What is really intriguing is whether having a smart TV or an iPhone—the ability to download a betting app to an iPhone and link it to a credit card or a betting account and to bet at any time—is essentially more addictive than what has always been the case, where you can walk to a TAB or an outlet like that to place a bet. I have a TAB very close to where I live and on occasion I have gone there and made a bet. I have noticed younger punters coming in and trying to pick a whole range of options regarding betting on the AFL, soccer, golf or whatever, but if they have sat down, worked out what they can afford to lose, filled out the correct ticket and are over 18, I am not sure that there is a problem. How they got to that stage seems to be what this debate is about. As people get to the legal age of being able to drink, vote, represent the country in the Army or go to the TAB, or bet in whichever way they want, I am not sure that regulations are ever going to change any of that. I am not sure that we can put up legislation or amendments in this place to have the effect that some people in this place want.</span>

                  </a>  I thank the Senate. During question time today Senator Ludwig denied that he and Mr Burke, and indeed the Gillard government, had received a proposal from the Queensland government in relation to the grazing in Queensland national parks of 300,000 drought affected cattle. Senator Ludwig came to the chamber at 4.30 this afternoon and said that he was also advised that the date recorded for the receipt of the letter that the Queensland government alleged they sent was recorded as 16 May. Senator Ludwig said that his ministerial and electorate office staff had searched fax machines and emails and they have not found a copy of a fax or an email sent from the Queensland government. He also went on to say:</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Small">I note that a letter was addressed to Mr Burke at a post office box in Roselands in New South Wales. At the end of question time Mr Burke's office advised my office that the proposal had not been received at his post office box, or by fax or email at either his electorate or parliamentary office.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I have before me copies of emails from the Queensland government to Mr Burke at Tony.Burke.MP@aph.gov.au, dated Tuesday 14 May at 1.54 pm, sending a copy of the letter making the application for help that I referred to today. A similar letter was at the same time emailed to Senator Ludwig.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The fact that Mr Burke last night told the media that he had been approached, and he commented on the application, I think proves the fact that Mr Burke did actually receive that, contrary to what Senator Ludwig said in question time and contrary to what he said at 4.30 this afternoon in his statement by leave to the chamber. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Mr Deputy President, I will seek leave in due course to table this email from the Queensland minister's office to Mr Burke, dated 14 May 2013 at 1.54 pm. I conclude this statement by indicating that at 4.52 this afternoon my office received confirmation from the Queensland government that the emails had been delivered on Tuesday, with a copy of their email logs. I do not quite understand what that means, but apparently it is proof in jargon that the email to Mr Burke was received. I also understand—I am not sure how people can do this—that Senator Ludwig himself obtained the same email log at 4.48 pm, having made his speech denying all knowledge of the email in the Senate approximately 10 minutes before.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Small">Tonight, I want to directly address you, the Australian people. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Small">While it's easy, and understandable, that you should be pessimistic about this government, everyone should be optimistic about our country. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Small">Our health researchers have saved hundreds of millions of lives through breakthroughs in everything from infectious diseases to cancer vaccines to ulcer treatments.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Small">Our military personnel stand ready to protect people in some of the world's worst trouble spots.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Small">Our universities are educating the future leaders of our region. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Small">Our musicians, artists, actors and film-makers are making their mark all over the world.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Small">Our resource exports have helped hundreds of millions to move from the third world to the middle class.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Small">And, with the right product, our manufacturing, too, is capable of competing with the best in the world, even with the high dollar – as demonstrated by Cochlear, Blackmores, Murray Goulburn and RM Williams, whose boots I'm wearing tonight.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Small">We are a great country and a great people let down by a bad government.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Small">Bad governments always pass.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Small">What should never dim is our faith that Australia's best years are ahead of us. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Small">So my purpose tonight is to assure you that a Coalition government will do what's needed to restore the hope, reward and opportunity that should be your birth right.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Small">Our Real Solutions Plan will build a strong and prosperous economy for a safe and secure Australia. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Small">Margie and I know the pressure that every Australian – that each one of you – is under.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Small">We're not crying poor but we run a household with power bills, rates, health and education costs to be paid all the time. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Small">Margie runs a community-based occasional care centre which has to live within its means just like every small business and every family.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Small">Governments' first job is not to make your life harder. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Small">But this government has – with its carbon tax, broken promises, and skyrocketing debt.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Small">Australian families are paying for this government's mistakes yet all you ever hear from the Prime Minister and the Treasurer are excuses and promises to do better next time.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Small">Should the Coalition win the election, there will be no nasty surprises and there'll be no lame excuses. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Small">No surprises and no excuses.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Small">The Coalition's Plan has two objectives: first, to take the budget pressure off Australian households; and second, to strengthen our economy so that, over time, there's more to go round for everyone. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Small">Only by delivering a strong economy can government deliver a sustainable National Disability Insurance Scheme and better schools.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Small">You need certainty to plan your future and you need cost of living relief.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Small">So tonight I announce a major initiative to ease the financial pressure on Australian families.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Small">A Coalition government will keep the current income tax thresholds and the current pension and benefit fortnightly rates while scrapping the carbon tax.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Small">The carbon tax will go but no one's personal tax will go up and no one's fortnightly pension or benefit will go down.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Small">So with a change of government, your weekly and fortnightly budgets will be under less pressure as electricity prices fall and gas prices fall and the carbon tax no longer cascades through our economy. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Small">This will strengthen our economy – because there'll less tax hitting Australian businesses but not their overseas competitors.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Small">And it will help families – because you'll have tax cuts funded by smaller government, not by taking money out of one pocket to put it in the other.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Small">Our plan starts with recognition of economic reality. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Small">Government doesn't create wealth; people do.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Small">Government doesn't spend its own money; it spends your money.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Small">This year's spending is either this year's taxes or it's this year's borrowing – that's next year's taxes. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Small">Government spending is not a free gift but something that everyone is paying for, now or in the future.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Small">That's why good governments are at least as careful spending the money they hold on trust from the people as you are when making decisions that affect your family's budget.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Small">Parents don't mortgage their children's future and neither should government.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Small">Last year, the Treasurer began his budget speech declaring, and I quote: "the four years of surpluses I announce tonight are a powerful endorsement of the…success of our policies". </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Small">Well, surpluses would have been a vindication.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Small">But there are no surpluses. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Small">Not this year. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Small">Not next year.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Small">Not the year after that. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Small">The Treasurer now says that there will be a surplus in four years' time.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Small">That's four years after the Treasurer and the Prime Minister said that it had already actually been delivered and spent tens of thousands of your dollars boasting about it in letters to their constituents.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Small">If a public company made these sorts of claims its directors would most likely face serious charges rather than asking to be re-elected. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Small">If this had been the only dodgy promise, they might have got away with it but this government never gets it right.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Small">It got the mining tax numbers wrong.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Small">It got the carbon tax numbers wrong.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Small">And last year's budget commitments to boost family payments and to cut taxes didn't even make it to this year's budget.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Small">This year's supposed revenue shortfall went from $7 billion, to $12 billion to $17 billion in just two weeks – so how can ministers possibly predict a decade ahead? </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Small">The Prime Minister guaranteed there would be no carbon tax – but there is.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Small">She guaranteed there would be a surplus – 165 times she guaranteed there would be a surplus – but there isn't and there never will be under the government.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Small">After seven deficits totalling $220 billion, the Treasurer can hardly congratulate himself over an almost invisible surplus, if nothing goes awry, if he's still there, in four years' time, in his ninth budget.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Small">The government originally said that the deficit was "temporary".</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Small">With seven in a row, the Second World War was more temporary than this government's deficits. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Small">The government promised a surplus over the cycle but this isn't a cycle – it's a spiral, deeper and deeper into debt which is now surging towards $400 billion even on the government's own figures.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Small">The last time a Labor Treasurer stood in this parliament to deliver a surplus was way back in 1989 so it's hardly surprising that this year's Labor surplus promises are no more believable than last year's.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Small">In the second line of this week's budget speech the Treasurer said that it was a budget for jobs and growth.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Small">In fact, unemployment increases and growth decreases. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Small">The Treasurer spent much of his speech complaining that he was the victim of a sudden collapse in government revenue. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Small">In fact, revenue is up 6 per cent this year and will be up 7 per cent next year. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Small">Next year, revenue will be up $80 billion on six years ago.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Small">That's right, the Treasurer has $80 billion more to balance his budget than Peter Costello ever had – yet Costello delivered surplus after surplus. </span>

              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Small">Many of the measures in this budget are objectionable, the attacks on Medicare; the abolition of the baby bonus which the government had promised never to touch; robbing Peter to pay Paul on education; and forcing more businesses to do the tax paperwork monthly, not just quarterly. </span>

              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Small">By keeping, if needed, all Labor's budget cuts – and – by not implementing any of their budget spending measures unless specified, we will achieve the first duty of every government: namely, to preserve the nation's finances. </span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">
                  <a href="ka5" type="MemberSpeech">
                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Senator MILNE</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Tasmania</span>—<span class="HPS-MinisterialTitles">Leader of the Australian Greens</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">20:05</span>):  The budget is the most value-laden of any document tabled in the parliament. It reflects the priorities for the nation and the future. The Treasurer said as much at the beginning of his budget speech on Tuesday. If you want to know what people and governments value, then follow how they raise and spend their money. The test of this budget is not the size of the deficit or how quickly Treasury forecasts a path back to surplus, but rather whether the decisions underpinning and outlined in the budget make Australia a greater nation at home and abroad. Whether it make us a more caring, happy and prosperous community; whether it looks after the precious places and plants and animals that we all love and the natural and built environment in which we grow food and in which we live; and whether it delivers all this in a fiscally-responsible way.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">What is so disappointing about the budget is that it does not present a coherent vision of where the country needs to be in 10 years time or of how we face the challenges posed by an increasing global population in a rapidly warming world, the interdependence of economies and our own narrow economic base, as well as our overdependence on resource based industries and the fossil fuel intensive energy sector that drives them. We have hollowed out the manufacturing sector, we have failed to invest in education and we have stuck our heads and future in a hole in the ground. We have done so for decades and we are planning to keep on doing it.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">What Australians needed was relief from the pressure they are feeling day to day in keeping a roof over their heads and food on the table; and they needed hope in relation to the anxiety they feel about the future when they hear of job losses, fees rising, farmers walking off the land and traffic congestion. They wanted to know that those pressures can be relieved. People wanted a vision, a glimpse even, of a future in which everyone can be healthy and flourish, with a great education and with job prospects in a dynamic, diversified economy. They wanted a visions of a future where they can live in a safe climate, in communities that are safe, sustainable and friendly; and can look forward to an old age supported by appropriate health and aged-care services.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The fact that this budget is a finance plan without a broad vision, and beset by confusion and contradictions, is what makes it fail as a budget. And Mr Abbott's alternative is worse: full of rhetoric but devoid of detail—the very 'magic pudding' against which Mr Hockey railed. While championing important and necessary reforms, such as DisabilityCare and Gonski education funding, the government cannot at the same time aspire to be a low-taxing government. We have a lower tax-to-GDP ratio than even under the Howard government. You cannot claim to be choosing a smarter Australia while cutting funding to research and development, universities and students, in order to fund schools. You cannot claim to be addressing climate change while stripping millions from renewable energy and continuing to shuffle billions of dollars into fossil fuel subsidies. And you cannot claim to be choosing a fairer Australia while condemning those who are unemployed to poverty. I noticed that is precisely what Mr Abbott said he would do, but even worse.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">In contrast, the Australian Greens have a consistent vision shared by many Australians: we want the gap between rich and poor to be closing, not widening; we want a sustainable environment to future-proof our economy and quality of life; we want infrastructure spending that gives us clean, liveable cities; we want farmers to stay on the land; and we want investment in research and development, and education and innovation to give us the low-carbon economy we need to meet the challenge of global warming. We recognise revenue must be raised and we want it to come from those who can afford it—mining corporations making billions of dollars from resources the people own, and major banks already making record profits. We want Australians to keep their generosity of spirit in the community both here and abroad, and for Australia to be a respected global citizen. Yet, despite continuing growth, low unemployment and inflation under control, millions of Australians feel uncertain about the future, uncomfortable and under pressure. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The question is: what is the government doing in this budget to relieve that pressure? Labor is not doing enough, and we know from Mr Abbott's speech tonight that a coalition government will make it even worse. The opposition leader gave us no confidence that he will place people over short-term economic outcomes. He says we need a competent, trustworthy, adult government, but, as one wag said today, 'He's right, but where will we find one?' Certainly not with Whyalla-wiped-off-the-map, Gladstone-ghost-town Mr Abbott—an alternative prime minister who said in his book, <span style="font-style:italic;">Battlelines</span>, that the role of other ministers is to pick holes in your argument wherever possible so he tried to avoid taking things to cabinet. It sounds very much like Direct Action.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">He says he will be 'honest' and 'competent', but he is facing at least a $70 billion black hole now gaping even further from his scrapping the carbon price but keeping the compensation and tax cuts. How on earth is he going to keep an $18,200 tax-free threshold plus all other compensation and pay the polluters as well? This is going back to the Costello handout era of corporate welfare on steroids. We are going to see, according to Mr Abbott, a company tax cut as well. What happened to Mr Hockey's end to the age of entitlement? This is dishonest and incompetent, and it will be no surprise when it is not funded. Without raising more revenue from more taxes, we will see bigger and more extreme cuts to services, thousands of public servants out of jobs, polluters being paid and even less support for those in need from Mr Abbott and the coalition.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Let us test the claim of a stronger economy that was made by the government in the budget. Not so. Instead, we have the absolute failure of the minerals resource rent tax to raise any significant revenue—only $200 million in its first year. This is an embarrassment for Labor, who championed the tax to 'spread the benefits of the boom'. Well, $200 million does not go very far. If Labor had the backbone to stand up to the big mining corporations, it would not need to slash funding to universities or push single parents into poverty. As John Falzon from St Vincent de Paul has said:</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Small">… this Budget is less Robin Hood and more Sheriff of Nottingham.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">No wonder Tony Abbott intends to support the government's cuts. Let me address the attempts by the Treasurer to explain away the failure of his mining tax. He points to the drop in commodity prices, and it is true: commodity prices have come off their record highs, but they are still at historically high levels. It is true that the resource rent taxes are on profits, but can the Treasurer explain how Rio Tinto, which made a $9 billion profit from iron ore last year, paid no mining tax? Is the Labor Party really suggesting that a $9 billion profit is not enough to be taxed?</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The reality is that the mining tax has fundamental design flaws as a result of BHP, Rio and Xstrata running rings around the Treasurer and the willingness of the Prime Minister to cut a political deal at the expense of the community. Labor has shown in this budget its lack of courage, as has Mr Abbott in his budget reply. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Unlike Labor and the Coalition, the Greens are not afraid to stand up to the big mining corporations in the interests of the Australian people. If the government had the courage to close the loopholes in the mining tax, like they are looking do to for other multinational business arrangements, this could be a nation that invests in education as a whole—rather than cutting from universities and child care to fund schools.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">What about a smarter nation? Education is central to our vision for Australia. The Greens will give children better education from early childhood through school and onto university and TAFE. The government is right to highlight the need for a smarter Australia but a nation does not become smarter by cutting funding to universities and research. Indeed, this is a dumb choice. We are risking competitiveness in the global economy as well as our capacity to respond to global challenges by raising money from the poorest students and our universities. Our universities have been vocal about the effects of these cuts on the quality of the education they can provide, and according to a poll by Universities Australia over 50 per cent of Australians oppose cutting university funding to pay for schools. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Australian students are already under pressure, with more than 80 per cent of full-time undergraduates working as well as studying. The changes to the Start-up scholarships will place even greater debt burdens on Australia's poorest students. It is a measure that is contrary to the ideal of opportunity for all in education and it is likely to see a reduction of enrolments from those who are most disadvantaged. That is dumb and mean and the Australian Greens will move to block the cuts to universities and students.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The challenge for the coalition is whether they will work with the Greens to protect our universities—in particular our regional universities, who will be hit very hard by these cuts—and ensure greater opportunities for students, or whether they will continue this harsh agenda. According to the Leader of the Opposition tonight, they will continue the harsh agenda. As he said, he will back all of Labor's cuts if he happens to get into government. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">For all the talk of creating a smarter Australia, this budget, on top of cuts to research and development last year, turns its back on some of the most exciting, innovative projects that are happening in this country and that are in dire need of support before their funding runs out within a year. The Bionics Institute, whose teams have played a key role in the successful development of Australia's world leading bionic ear over the past 25 years, has a plan to develop six new devices in the next five years to treat chronic pain and movement and psychiatric disorders. The potential health benefits and market size are bigger than for Cochlear's bionic ear. They need only $24 million over five years to keep going, yet despite requests there is nothing for them in the budget. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Meanwhile Bionic Vision Australia, a world leading national consortium of researchers working together to develop a bionic eye, is currently using advanced manufacturing techniques to make in Australia prototypes that right now are being tested in patients. They need a mere $8 million a year for the next three years to keep going—but the budget turns its back on them. Without secure funding past this year, researchers will pack up and look to other countries that can offer greater support and we may lose this work forever—just as we have with so many climate scientists and technologies. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">News today that CSIRO scientists have developed flexible solar panels that can be printed at home is great, but cutting 165 jobs from that very institution, the CSIRO, is dumb. These are the industries of the future, where Australia's advanced manufacturing techniques and our incredible intellectual capacity work together. If we can sell the world a bionic eye or an implant that relieves pain, it will be far better than shipping off coal or woodchips. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The Australian economy is in transition. We must move away from dig it up, cut it down, ship it away. We can prepare for the new economy or be caught out. The old parties seem more than content to leave us to be caught out by the changing global situation and the carbon bubble that will see huge coal projects and ports stranded as black elephants. Cutting more than $1 billion from renewable energy, energy efficiency and the environment is not smart or strong and it is further evidence that Labor cannot be trusted on the environment. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Let us be clear: we are in a climate change emergency. Last week climate scientists reported that, for the first time, atmospheric CO<span style="text-decoration:none underline;">2</span> concentration figures exceeded 400 parts per million, moving us perilously close to runaway climate change. In that context the government have to answer two fundamental questions in the budget.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">First, why do they believe that the measures to reduce greenhouse gas emissions should be revenue neutral? The government asserts that receipts from the sale of emission permits should equal expenditure on assistance measures and programs to promote energy efficiency and renewable energy. But why? Given that we are in a climate emergency and deep and sustained emission cuts are a scientific imperative, why should expenditure on climate related programs be revenue neutral? It is like saying that defence should be revenue neutral in a war. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Second, the government said the funding to climate related programs needed to be cut because of the lower carbon pricing when trading starts. But the trading period does not start until 2015-16, so why is the government cutting almost $400 million from the essential Australian Renewable Energy Agency, the effective Low Carbon Communities program and the critical Biodiversity Fund during this two-year period? Not only is this a breach of the Multi-Party Climate Change Committee agreement; it is denying Australians cheaper electricity prices through investments in renewable energy.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The opposition is not serious about climate change either and, contrary to his promises about a secure and safe Australia, Mr Abbott is mortgaging our children's future. His Direct Action plan still has not won support from a single Australian economist or industry group. Perhaps Mr Abbott, who wants to be seen as honest, trustworthy and competent, can give a straight answer to the question of the dollars that are going to go into the carbon fund and a yes or no answer as to whether he will maintain the 41,000 gigawatt hour target for the large-scale RET.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The budget is further evidence that the Labor government is internally conflicted about climate change and cannot be trusted to protect the environment. The rush for coal seam gas and the exporting of more and more coal is killing the Great Barrier Reef and destroying valuable farmland and groundwater systems, and Labor and the coalition are standing by and letting this destruction happen. Not one coal seam gas project has been rejected by Minister Burke—not smart or strong; that is dumb, weak and dangerous. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">So is Mr Abbott's proposed one-stop shop for environmental approvals. Mr Abbott will stand by and let the Queensland government turn cattle into national parks and allow them to graze those national parks at the same time as he stands by and allows the Queensland government to overturn national parks for logging. Today we had an Abbott opposition talking about agreeing to logging in World Heritage areas.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Despite taking the chair of the G20 next year, Australia is failing to live up to the commitment given at the G20 to end fossil fuel subsidies. While we welcome the cuts to carbon capture and storage programs—which was always a nonsense and a waste of money—the government will continue to provide billions in tax breaks for big mining corporations, while pushing single parents onto Newstart. While shaving the subsidy for mining exploration, the government's ongoing financial support to the big miners is bad for the climate and a diversion of taxpayer funds which could go into creating a more caring society. These are the choices and priorities of Labor and they are backed by the opposition.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">And what about fairer? The Greens have a vision not of closing the gap not only on ecological sustainability but also between rich and poor—and that gap has been widening. We support a universal health system that includes caring for our teeth and growing more secure jobs throughout our economy. DisabiltyCare is a significant reform towards a better and more equal society. We Greens are proud to have backed it from the beginning and to have supported it through the parliament. We congratulate the Gillard government for delivering.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Achieving a more equitable schools funding model is another important step for a fairer society. The Australian Greens are right behind the Gonski school funding reforms. We have been advocating a fairer funding model for schools for over a decade and we want it legislated before we rise for the election. The test will be whether the government's proposals live up to the expectations of the Gonksi review for an equitable funding system. Australians have reason to be sceptical, given the very modest funding available in the next four years. For a Prime Minister who proclaims education to be the reason she entered parliament, she is selling the school children of Australia short with only $473 million next year. More money should be flowing to our public schools—the schools that educate our most disadvantage kids—and it should be flowing faster. The longer we wait the more kids we are selling short. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The coalition is all at sea on this issue, but to be perfectly clear—and from his speech tonight—Mr Abbott has said he will not proceed without additional funding unless all the states sign up. At this point many have not done so. The Greens will protect a fairer and more equitable funding model against a coalition government intent on letting our public schools down. We will stand in the Senate and in the House of Representatives against any repeal.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">In contrast to schools, the budget actually cuts funding to child care. It keeps in place the freeze on indexation on the childcare benefit rebate, leading to increased pressure on families struggling with the cost of living. When we know fees are increasing and the childcare sector desperately needs help to provide quality and flexible care for busy families, this is neither smart nor fair. The biggest disappointment for many Australians who are really struggling is the failure of the government to increase the rate of Newstart and youth allowance, and its continued punishment of single parents. The paltry increase of $19 a week to the allowable income of Newstart recipients, including single parents, puts a lie to Labor's claims of 'a fairer society'. It is an insult to those who are struggling to make ends meet. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">More than that, the decision to abolish the baby bonus by incorporating some of it into family tax benefit A will further hurt low-income families. While the Greens support, in principle, reform of the baby bonus, we want to ensure the poorest in our community are not hit harder by these changes. It is disappointing that once again the opposition have joined with Labor to remove benefits from those most in need. Mr Abbott went even further in his speech tonight. Not only is he going to cut Newstart even further but also he is going to delay the superannuation guarantee and take away the low-income tax rebate, at the same time letting the big miners off.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The failure of the Gillard government to increase Newstart payments by $50 a week, an increase supported by both business and the community sector, will lead to more people falling deeper into poverty. It is even more disappointing that the government has decided not to act, despite the other place today voting to support a Greens motion noting that Newstart is too low. This was the choice the government made—uncaring and mean, like its race with the coalition to the bottom on who can be crueller to asylum seekers fleeing horrors in their own lands.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Lord Stern commented this week that with global warming the challenge of food security will see displacement of millions. In such a global context, Australia cannot continue its appalling treatment of refugees. It was disgraceful to hear the Leader of the Opposition say that he is going to rescind the increased humanitarian intake.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The cruel government and coalition policies are costing billions—nearly $10 billion from 2012 to the end of the forward estimates—and are undermining our international reputation; but more than that, it is just deliberately cruel policy. They are spending almost twice as much on cruel detention polices than on DisabiltyCare and Gonski combined over the forward estimates. What does that say about a fairer society? We also learned in the budget that the government is looking to revise Australia's refugee assessment processes to find new ways to punish refugees and shut people out from safety. This is the government now wanting to wind back humanitarian protections, to deport more refugees back to the countries they have fled from. It is not the policy of a nation that cares for people or seeks to play a leadership role in the Asian Century.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Adding insult to injury, we are now allocating overseas aid money to our cruel and inhumane refugee detention policies, in contradiction to the government's own scope of legitimate aid document, making us the third biggest recipient of our own overseas aid—not fair, not smart; plain dumb and mean. As well as demonstrating its lack of compassion here in Australia in the last two years the government has cut $4.8 billion to overseas aid over the forward estimates. Australia is in the right place at the right time for the very first time in our history. Not only are we hosting the G20 next year but also we have been elected to the United Nations Security Council. But we are in danger of being perceived as uncaring by the rest of the world and on the international stage of making promises, only then to break them. It should concern all Australians that, while campaigning for a seat on the Security Council, Australia promised to meet our aid target of 0.5 in the time frame agreed, and now we have reneged twice. What sort of country are we looking like?</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Population pressures exist not only overseas but also here at home. Some of the real pressures Australians are feeling come from living in cities with inadequate infrastructure. We welcome the commitment to rail projects, in particular the Metro rail and Perth rail projects, but are disappointed no funds were there for Hobart's light rail. And we are concerned about the apparent embrace by Labor of the failed public-private partnership model.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">It is also disappointing that much of the good planning work on boosting public transport and active travel to create more sustainable and liveable cities has not been converted into action—70 per cent of funding is still flowing to road projects. Investing in public transport and rail will relieve pressure on people in our cities, but the old parties retain their obsession with roads. The coalition's speech tonight was a classic in this regard—more highways everywhere.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The government also failed to acknowledge the national housing crisis. The Labor Party and the Liberals have turned their back on millions of Australians struggling with unaffordable housing. Housing pressure is enormous here, yet the budget essentially ignored it, with no new programs for housing affordability, no new money to tackle homelessness, no boost in public housing, no plans for more affordable rentals or more affordable ownership and no mention of the word 'housing' at all in the budget speech. So much for 'fairer'.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Quality of life is further enhanced by the arts and we welcome the fact that the national cultural policy is now to be enacted and we welcome the restructuring of the Australia Council. The Greens have been campaigning for a long time for increased resources to the ABC and SBS and are happy to have delivered a $129 million boost to the ABC and an increase of $30 million for SBS. However, the failure to find a measly $1.4 million for community radio is a disgrace. The Greens will continue to do what we can to ensure additional support for community radio.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Furthermore, regional arts have been ignored. In fact, the whole of regional Australia does not seem to exist for the Labor Party. Rural and regional Australia, which is facing very significant challenges, has been let down by the slashing of Caring for our Country and the Biodiversity Fund—and taking $2 billion away from the Regional Infrastructure Fund will not make for a stronger economy or a fairer Australia.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">A stronger society is not just about money but also about how we relate to each other. The Greens are going to continue to boost that dividend of decency in Australia by pursuing marriage equality and banning sports gambling advertising before nine o'clock.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The Treasurer is reported to have yesterday placed Labor between the austerity freaks on the one hand and the Green types on the other. The Green types, according to him, want the bottom to fall out of the budget. Last year it was the Treasurer who was the austerity freak, insistent on a budget surplus this year, and it was the Greens showing economic maturity and responsibility in calling for a delay in the surplus. And it is now we, the Green types, who—far from wanting the bottom to fall out of the budget—have been identifying revenue measures, including fixing the mining tax, ending fossil fuel subsidies and introducing a levy on the big banks. It is the Treasurer who would rather engage in stereotyping than standing up to Rio Tinto, BHP, Xstrata or the big banks.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The Labor government had the opportunity with this budget to manage the economy in a way which would care for people and protect our environment. That would have been smart and fair. Instead, we got $2.3 billion of university cuts, a billion taken from clean energy and the environment, and continued punishment for single parents and the unemployed. I do not think they will take much comfort from a 10-year road map with a shelf life, if the polls are right, of only a few months.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">And Tony Abbott will be worse, if his speech tonight is anything to go by. That is why you need the Greens. It is governments working with the Greens that deliver major reforms. It is the Greens who have delivered the clean energy package, it is the Greens who have delivered Denticare and it will be the Greens who deliver marriage equality. What is more, we will stand up strongly in the Senate and the House of Representatives. We will not allow the repeal of important initiatives we have fought hard for, particularly those in the areas of schools and clean energy. We will stand against the excesses of any future government, including an Abbott government, which tries to turn such achievements back.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The Australian Greens will deliver a caring Australia, a path to a safe climate and a proud global reputation. We are the competent, adult, honest party which will stand up to those who protect their own interests to the detriment of the environment and who deny everyone else a fair go. It is the Greens who will stand up with a strong voice for what is right and what is genuinely strong, smart and fair in caring for people and protecting our environment.</span>

You would think that, based on the statement by the Indonesian President and these figures alone, a review of Australia's large foreign aid each year to Indonesia would be prudent. However, it appears we have not taken the figures into consideration. In fact, as I said earlier, we have increased our aid to Indonesia by $105.2 million a year to a staggering $646.8 million.</span>

In doing so, according to the foreign minister, I have shown myself to be a reckless, unthinking Australian. At least he lets me keep my citizenship. The foreign minister cited a number of projects being conducted in Indonesia with the help of Australian aid money, and I agree these are great achievements. But I question why we have brought about increasing Australian aid by $500 million in six years when they can afford to increase their military spending by $6 billion in the same period.

I can think of a number of projects that are sorely needed in Timor-Leste, mainly because of the rampant destruction caused by the Indonesian military as it reluctantly left. These could be easily completed with a portion of the aid currently being given to Indonesia. Maybe it is the </span>
                  <span style="&#xD;&#xA;    font-family:;&#xD;&#xA;  ">methods used to determine how we spend our aid that need to be looked at.

If the government wants to deny years of mounting evidence they can do so, but they should not be surprised when the average Australian, reckless and unthinking though they may be, is outraged that their tax dollars are assisting these atrocities.

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Tasmania</span>—<span class="HPS-MinisterialTitles">Deputy Government Whip in the Senate</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">20:51</span>):  Several months ago I spoke in this chamber about the opposition's slide towards Tea Party style tactics. I cited evidence showing that this development has distorted the coalition's decision-making on policies of national importance and led to a limitless strategy of obstructionism and defiance. In deciding to fight every day in Tea Party mode no tactic has been deemed too petty or excessive. This week the coalition reached a new low by denying a pair to a mother, Michelle Rowland, who was trying to return home and care for a sick 14-month-old child. Like the rest of Australia I was stunned that the coalition had sunk this low.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">It is not just the coalition's stance on key issues or mean-spirited political tactics that we should be concerned about. It is something even more fundamental: the denigration of political debate in Australia that is being driven by the opposition leader and his team.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">In America, this sort of shrill, fear-driven campaigning led to the tragic shooting of United States congresswoman Gabrielle Giffords. How much further will the opposition leader go until his tactics lead to a similar disaster occurring in Australia? Already the political narrative, relentlessly pursued by the opposition leader and shadow Treasurer, has unleashed responses in some sections of the public that are honestly quite frightening. This can be largely attributed to the fact that coalition politicians are free to associate themselves with Tea Party style protests which place a premium on ignorance, and disregard informed decision or discussion of policy or leadership. We should never forget Tony Abbott's call for a 'people's revolt', which saw a series of aggressive demonstrations and a new type of political extremism in Australia. The alternative leader of this country was standing proudly in front of 'ditch the witch' placards at a time when death threats were sent to Independent MPs. That is the calibre of the opposition.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">At one anti carbon price rally in July 2011, some participants suggested to the shadow Treasurer that Australians should 'take up arms against the government'. What sort of hysterical, pitchfork-carrying nonsense is this? The look on Joe Hockey's face was one of alarm at just what his party has unleashed in Australia. Now it is out of control and these voices are growing louder. We saw it when the protesters swarmed outside Minister Albanese's electorate office in Sydney and hurled abuse at him, calling him 'a maggot', amongst other things. Members of the coalition, including the member for Indi, Sophie Mirabella, were right there next to the protestors carrying placards that read, 'Tolerance is our demise,' and 'Carbon dioxide is not pollution'.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Perhaps the worst offender has to be the Consumers and Taxpayers Association, CATA—the group responsible for many of these hate filled public events in recent times. This includes the protests featuring the infamous 'ditch the witch' placards I mentioned a moment ago. Although Tony Abbott has since distanced himself slightly, in March this year we still had Barnaby Joyce and Liberal member for Hughes, Craig Kelly—</span>

                    <span class="HPS-MemberContinuation">Senator POLLEY:</span>
                  </a>  My apologies. Senator Barnaby Joyce and Liberal member for Hughes, Craig Kelly, were proudly addressing a 'rotten to the core' rally. I should not have to remind Senator Joyce and Mr Kelly that this group has covered themselves in glory on numerous occasions over the last couple of years. The group's spokesperson stated publicly that the furore over Alan Jones's 'died of shame' comment was an overreaction and that Jones was the subject of cyber-bullying. They have hurled abuse at the elected Prime Minister of this country during question time. They have perpetrated climate change denialism. The list goes on, and the coalition is right next to them every step of the way.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">This trend of extremism and political activism embraced by the coalition comes at a huge cost to Australia. Tony Abbott has sought to consistently undermine the government's efforts to reasonably manage the Australian economy and has done this in part by lowering the tone of the debate at every turn. Remember, it was Labor's response to the global financial crisis that saved hundreds of thousands of jobs and small businesses in this country. It was praised by Noble prize-winning economists and ensured that Australia did not slide into recession. Our economy has a gold-plated AAA credit rating. This is the envy of countries around the world, but all we have heard from the opposition is a series of breathtakingly stupid comments. We had the shadow Treasurer saying that the Australian economy is 'flatlining', even though it has grown considerably. He also regularly implies that running a $1.5 trillion national economy is not dissimilar to running a household budget. This is of course part of a wider trend when it comes to the economy and a range of other issues, as senior coalition leaders try to sound like everyday people. If I hear Tony Abbott say the words 'fair dinkum'—</span>

                  </a>  If I hear Mr Abbott say the words 'fair dinkum' one more time, I will vomit. We also need to consider that the coalition's fixation on ignorance is damaging Australia's strong international reputation as a progressive and dynamic middle power. When <span style="font-style:italic;">Euromoney</span> magazine awarded its prestigious Finance Minister of the Year award to Treasurer Wayne Swan, the shadow Treasurer basically threw his toys out of the pram. Let's not forget that he made several telling remarks, including this gem when discussing past winners. He said:</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Small">In 2001 there was a Pakistani finance minister. That is quite an extraordinary one, that one.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">If the shadow Treasurer had conducted any semblance of research, he would have found that the Pakistani minister in question could have headed Citibank in New York. Instead, he returned to Pakistan to institute successful economic reforms. Extraordinary indeed!</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Sometimes it seems that every time the opposition leader opens his mouth, he tarnishes the country's image. He has publicly lamented the fact that the Prime Minister will not 'lie down and die' and stated that the science behind climate change is 'absolute crap'. Even his own party cringed when he said in September last year that the Prime Minister should be talking to the Indonesian president in Jakarta rather than 'swanning around in New York talking to Africans'. How embarrassing! This was despite the fact that the Prime Minister was attending the annual four-day assembly of the United Nations, which was also attended by the president.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Mr Abbott and senior members of his party have been raising the bar of stupidity, and it is to the detriment of the political discourse in this country. This means that moderate members of the Liberal Party are quickly becoming an endangered species. They must look on in horror every time they witness their leader pursue his chief strategy: 'Give me the prime ministership or I will wreck the joint.' There is no nuance, no thoughtful opinion, no well-constructed arguments or invitation to challenge the merits of an idea. Instead they rely simplistically on mantras like 'stop the boats' or 'great big new tax.' It is vicious, crude and cheap, and it demonstrates that the Abbott coalition is a political soulmate of the Republican Party.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The Liberals' strategy is to make politics a policy-free zone, and by unleashing their attack dogs and fomenting this culture of ugly protest the opposition has redefined political demonstrations in Australia. How on earth has this come to be? And tonight, when we heard the budget in reply, what did we get? We got more of the same negativity, denying that there is any need to address climate change. It was more of the same, and we know on this side, as the Australian public already know—and we will educate them—about the challenges ahead they will face under any incoming coalition government, and that is their attacks on Australian workers and what they will do in bringing back Work Choices mark 3. We know what Tony Abbott's history was when he was the minister for health. He gutted the health department by a billion dollars. <span style="font-style:italic;&#xD;&#xA;    font-size:12pt;&#xD;&#xA;  ">(Time expired)</span></span>

That blind competitor was our mate, Ben Phillips. I give full credit to Benny. He set out to beat his own world record and he did.</span>

I am very honoured that one of the team members Mr Greg Bell a famous trail walker, has joined me in the chamber tonight. Mr Bell was back for his fourth trail walk. Our totally blind competitor Ben Phillips was back for the third time, and the Melburnian Tigers Trailwalker, Daniel White, was there for his second walk. I would have to admit that in my own case it was walk No. 13.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">There were 750 teams, assisted by support crews, and 850 Oxfam volunteers took part in this year's Melbourne Oxfam Trailwalker. Of the 3,024 participants, 79 per cent finished the 100 kilometres, and 54 per cent of teams made it to the finish line as a complete team of four. I am pleased to report that, once again, every member of the Tigers team finished with all four members crossing the finish line. The Melbourne Oxfam Trailwalker event seems to be getting tougher every year. This year there were significant changes made to the trail which, in fact, increased the average time taken for teams to complete the course by 33 minutes. So I am also pleased to be able to report to the Senate that the Tigers beat the average time for completing the walk by a very substantial eight minutes.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The event this year started on a crisp autumn morning at Wheelers Hill which is, I am told, 22 kilometres south-east of the Melbourne CBD. The start line offers walkers a panoramic view of the Dandenongs. The view of those mountains in the early stages of the walk are a constant reminder to participants of the tough challenge that lies ahead of them. The trail walk follows Dandenong Creek through the Churchill National Park, slowly transitioning from suburbs to bush through to Lysterfield Lake. After Lysterfield Lake the trail changes significantly from that of previous years. The Tigers team battled through those new sections, including the gruelling Kokoda Memorial Track—known locally as 'the 1,000 steps'—as well as some of the most mountainous terrain of the Dandenong Ranges National Park. In fact, it was not without some difficulty this year because, in the wee small hours of Saturday morning, plummeting temperatures almost forced Ben to withdraw from the event as his own body temperature dropped alarmingly. But after an hour or two under a space blanket and under the close eye of Oxfam paramedics, we were delighted that Ben was given the all clear to battle on.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The next morning, the Yarra Valley and the gullies and forests of the Dandenongs were a very welcome distraction from blisters and the freezing overnight temperatures. The final section is easily the toughest part of the trail. It includes a steep climb towards Mount Little Joe, then what I could only describe as goat tracks, the odd fire trail and finally some very steep and rocky ascents and descents. Needless to say, the finish line at Wesburn Park could not have come soon enough for us and all the other competitors.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">As always, we could not have done it without the tireless assistance of our amazing support crew. The Tigers would like to sincerely thank all the staff from the office of my colleague Anthony Byrne MP, the member for Holt. Special thanks go, again, to Alexandra Stalder; her mum, Helen Stalder; and Nick McLennan. I have to say, in relation to Alexandra and Helen, they have supported and made it all happen for the Tigers team in Melbourne for five years, and we really do appreciate such sterling support and effort on their part.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">As always, thanks also go to the Balmain Tigers Rugby League Football Club for their ongoing support for our team. I only wish we could give some support to Balmain Tigers, because they are not travelling as well as one would hope this season, in the guise of Wests Tigers—as you would appreciate, Mr President. I hope—perhaps against hope!—that they will turn their fortunes around against South Sydney this weekend. And Mr President, I note the bias from the chair as you shake your head—I am not sure that is quite acceptable from the President of the Senate! I understand that you might be somewhat doubtful about the chances of the Tigers, but we will be with them anyway.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">But of course, as you know, Oxfam is a great cause. Since 1999 Oxfam Trailwalker events in Australia have raised more than $49 million. Donations assist Oxfam's vital work in developing countries around the globe and in Indigenous communities in Australia and really do assist and equip some of the world's most vulnerable people to bring about very positive change in their lives. There are a number of people in this place, including some in the chamber here tonight, who have been very strong supporters of our team, and I thank all those in the building who have done that over many years now.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">As of 15 minutes ago, the 2013 Melbourne Oxfam Trailwalker event has raised over $2½ million. The Tigers so far have raised $9,690, so we are just $310 shy of our $10,000 fundraising target, which we are very confident we will not only reach but exceed. So, if anyone would like to donate and help us reach our goal and assist the wonderful work of Oxfam, please visit—here we go again; it is always a great risk when I read a website into the <span style="font-style:italic;">Hansard </span>record, but, Mr President, for yours and for everyone else's edification, I am going to do it again here tonight—it is https://trailwalker.oxfam.org.au/team/home/14157. I thank the Senate.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">
                  <a href="207825" type="MemberSpeech">
                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Senator McKENZIE</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Victoria</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">21:12</span>):  Tonight I am a very proud member of the Abbott-Truss coalition, having sat and listened, in the bleachers, to the budget in-reply speech given by Mr Abbott on behalf of us all. And what a stark contrast it was, for the Australian public going forward, between what an Abbott-Truss government would be offering—restoring the trust between the people and their government, doing what we say we will do, keeping the promises we make and responsibly managing Australia's financial issues—and Prime Minister Gillard, Mr Windsor and the Greens and the merry dance they have led us on in our fiscal situation; I think 'spiral' was the word used tonight. Where there has been a culture of divide and conquer, what we heard tonight was about a culture of collaboration, focused on increasing productivity—unchaining business to grow, to employ and to ultimately contribute. I am sure Regional Australia would welcome a government that focused on Jakarta, not Geneva, in its foreign policy. That will be no more evidenced, if the coalition is successful in September, by the unshackling of our environmental policy and our financial future from Europe by getting rid of the carbon tax.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Manufacturing and food processing operations are key to our future food security needs in this nation, and they have been closing. They have been closing at an increasing rate under this government, because they have been forced to compete, with their input costs going up, against nations who do not have the electricity costs they do, or the transport and labour costs et cetera. Eleven have closed. The carbon tax accumulates and cascades right through our food supply chain. And no matter what the opposite side says about agriculture not being subject to the carbon tax, it is—come and talk to my dairy farmers.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">No matter what the opposite side says about agriculture not being subject to the carbon tax, it is. Come and talk to my dairy farmers; come and talk to Senator Colbeck's dairy farmers. They would be happy to walk you through how it directly affects their businesses—not to mention businesses right through that food supply chain and our food manufacturing and then obviously on through the wider economy. It is functioning as a reverse tariff—and Mr Abbott mentioned that tonight—as jobs are lost throughout regional Australia. There have been: 68 jobs lost in Tamworth at Grain Product; 64 jobs lost in Rochester, a small town of 2,000 people in north central Victoria's Murray-Goulburn closed its milk drying operation there; 344 jobs lost from Golden Circle, with 146 of these again in north central Victoria in Girgarre and 38 in Wagga. This is a reverse tariff costing real jobs in regional communities.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">SPC Ardmona waits to hear from the government regarding their request for a safeguard investigation, a request that was made two weeks ago to this government by this business, which is employing 879 people in Shepparton just down the road from several of the towns that I have just mentioned, an area that has seen significant hardship. There were floods there 12 months ago that covered most of the orchards. We have had the uncertainty caused by the Murray-Darling Basin Plan. And here we have the iconic SPC Ardmona making a very valid and legitimate request of the government, and I am not getting a sense of urgency. Emergency safeguards are a temporary mechanism available under the WTO framework to assist local industry that is severely impacted by foreign imports. It is not an actual tariff—although our industry is operating under a reverse tariff. It is a short-term stop gap to give time to ascertain if there is an issue with another country's behaviour.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">It would be nice if this government would support communities, workers and growers. It is incredibly ironic that our food processing industry is subject to the reverse tariff of the Gillard-Greens-Windsor government while this very iconic company, which is key to this local community, is simply asking for a response from government. It should not take this amount of time. I call on the Minister Emerson, Minister Ludwig and the Prime Minister, Julia Gillard, to make the decision and let them know one way or the other, rather than just hanging them, their workers and the broader community out to dry.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I raise this here tonight because last Thursday I headed up to Shepparton, a great place in regional Victoria, for the 'Toss a tin in your trolley' rally. The AMWU was out in force, the local community was out in force, local leadership was out in force and growers were out in force. They were on a back of truck saying that this is important. We understand that there are two sides to this conversation. We understand that on the one hand we have to ensure that we have a framework and a way of operating in this nation so that food processors can get on with growing jobs, growing their business and ultimately contributing to the economy. On the other hand, the onus is on us as Australians to not support imported produce that supports jobs overseas. We need to make a conscious decision about what we put in our trolley. I thought that it was a really positive response by the local community. I would like to thank Teena Parris-Knight and Lee Luvara, who is a worker at the factory, for getting together on this. Teena actually set up a Facebook site saying 'Save SPC Ardmona' and got 3,000 supporters very quickly. I thought it was a great way for social media to actually do something positive in our regional community. So I would recommend to everyone out there to log on, sign up and toss a couple of tins of local produce into your trolley when you are next at the supermarket, if you can find it. Look hard and read the labels. The tins are usually on the bottom shelf, but the reasons for that are for another adjournment speech.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Orchardists Peter Hall and Doug Brown outlined the challenges for our growers in terms of having their quotas slashed going into the cannery. It means that the fruit they would usually send to the cannery now has to go to the fresh fruit market. It is not particularly grown for fresh fruit, so it is actually causing a huge impact and flow-on effect right through the food supply chain as the bottom falls out of the fresh fruit market. That is great for everyone who likes fresh fruit, because it is going to be nice and cheap, but it is not good for our growers.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The other challenge they outlined was that if at the end of the day they are not going to get enough money in their back pocket they are not going to be able to afford to pay the pickers to come and pick the fruit. So what we are actually going to be left with, now that the water from the floods has dried up, is a flood of rotting fruit on the ground. That is a huge biosecurity risk—not to mention the smell—because of the microorganisms and insects it will cause. I was a little disappointed with the minister's response today, because they were very genuine questions borne of a genuine concern for my community in central regional Victoria.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I would like the thank the AMWU for their passionate support for growers and their local regional community and for working so collaboratively around trying to find a solution to keep this company going, to keep their workers in jobs. At the end of the day it does not matter what your penalty rate is, because if you have not got a job you are not going to be able to earn it.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">This government fails to understand how we live and work in regional Australia. There were no ALP senators or ALP state members on the back of the truck. It was a crying shame. I urge the government to respond and to give some certainty to the Goulburn Valley community, which has been buffeted by this government's legislative programs—and I mention them: the CO2 tax and the Murray-Darling Basin Plan. Time means money. In this case it means actual jobs for real people. I would like the AMWU and the senators who are friendly with that particular union to do their utmost to lobby internally for this government to actually make a decision and let SPC Ardmona know where they stand, and get behind our local industry. So toss a tin in your trolley, please.</span>
