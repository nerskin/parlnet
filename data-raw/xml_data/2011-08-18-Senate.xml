                    <a href="7G6" type="MemberSpeech">
                      <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Senator LUNDY</span>
                    </a> (<span class="HPS-State">Australian Capital Territory</span>—<span class="HPS-MinisterialTitles">Parliamentary Secretary to the Prime Minister and Parliamentary Secretary for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">09:31</span>):  I am pleased that Labor will be supporting this private member's bill to strengthen the rights of territories. The Australian Capital Territory (Self-Government) Amendment (Disallowance and Amendment Power of the Common­wealth) Bill 2010 has been referred to a committee. That committee has reported back to the Senate. I would like to warmly welcome their recommendation that this bill be passed.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">At the outset, before I talk to some amendments, I would like to make it very clear that there are fundamental differences between this bill and another private member's bill that has also been introduced to the Senate, the Restoring Territory Rights (Voluntary Euthanasia Legislation) Bill 2010. It is fair to say that there is often some confusion about this, because they both relate to the way in which the territories are treated under Commonwealth law and their capacity to make legislation. But very clearly the purpose of the Restoring Territory Rights (Voluntary Euthanasia Legislation) Bill 2010—not the one we are debating today—is to repeal the euthanasia laws of 1997 and to repeal the provisions that preclude the ACT and NT from legislating on euthanasia. We will have an opportunity to speak about that another time. My own view is that it is about restoring territory rights.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">But the purpose of this bill is to remove the power of the executive to overturn territory legislation behind closed doors without a parliamentary process. This has become known as the power of veto, if you like, over territory legislation. It is an executive mechanism that we in the Labor Party agree does not accurately reflect the status, the capability and the maturity of either the ACT assembly or the Northern Territory parliament. This bill will not stop the federal parliament acting in the national interest in an open and transparent way—in other words, from dealing with issues through both houses of parliament—should there be a conflict between Commonwealth and territory legislation.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I would like to foreshadow government amendments to the bill that were recom­mended by the Senate committee. These amendments will remove some words in clause 4 of this bill, which at the moment says, 'providing relevant territory legislatures with exclusive legislative authority and responsibility for making laws'. Our amend­ment would remove that reference because it does not accurately reflect the current power of the Governor-General to recommend amendments to territory laws. As such, it cannot be achieved by the bill. And this parliament can use a legislative process to override territory laws. To reflect in this private member's bill that this did create exclusive legislative authority and responsi­bility for making laws was indeed inaccurate. Nonetheless, this bill is an important change, because it does remove that executive veto, as I mentioned.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The other government amendment that I wish to foreshadow reflects the recommend­ation of the Senate committee and removes the reference to Norfolk Island. Norfolk Island is currently undergoing an extensive reform process. That reform process has bipartisan support and the support of the Norfolk Island assembly. That process is underway and we need to give due regard to that reform process, which involves govern­ance and various accountability and transpar­ency measures. It would be appropriate to consider the status of Norfolk Island's governance arrangements through that reform process.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Through the course of the inquiry into this bill many comments were made, particularly by the opposition, recognising that it was time for a broad update of the Australian Capital Territory (Self-Government) Act. That recognition was across the board. In speaking to this bill as an ACT senator, I tend to agree. In fact the ACT government and Chief Minister have for some time been saying that it is probably time for an update of and a closer look at the Australian Capital Territory (Self-Government) Act, given that it came into force back in 1989. There are so many things one could say about the progress of the Australian Capital Territory. We can reflect positively on the maturity, stability and functioning of the ACT assembly in its governance role. All of these things stand up to scrutiny and support the general bipartisan view that an update of that act is due.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">However, it was disappointing that through the course of the inquiry it became clear that the opposition's position on this bill was to oppose it and that they were hiding behind a call for a broader review of the Australian Capital Territory (Self-Government) Act and using that as a reason not to support this bill. I will be very inter­ested to hear what the opposition have to say, because there is nothing in the context of a more comprehensive review or consideration of an update of the ACT (Self-Government) Act that would preclude their support for this bill right now. I know Senator Humphries is very tuned in to this issue. He has spoken many times on the right of the territories to create their own legislation. Indeed, we exchange words fairly regularly about this very issue. I would like to take this opportunity to remind Senator Humphries, the other ACT senator, of his past expressed avid resentment of federal interference in territory affairs and remind him that this is a significant opportunity for him and, indeed, for the opposition to respect the capacity and power of the legislature and remove this feature of an executive veto that is not shared by any of the states. It is something which applies only to the territories and, therefore, supporting this bill and the foreshadowed amendments by the government to remove that executive veto would bring the ACT and the Northern Territory into line with the states.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The final point I would like to make about this bill is that it really is about respecting those democratic rights. That is the basis upon which this bill has been proposed and the basis upon which we have debated similar issues in the past. The way in which we have seen this measure used by the former Howard government reminds us all that when we provide for self-government it is about trust, it is about respect and it is about the democratic authority of the government that has been put in place by an act of this parliament.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This is an opportunity to bring ACT democratic rights in line with those of the states and to stand up for the ACT assembly and, through it, all the people of Canberra. If the opposition turn their backs on this issue now, it will provide evidence that that is not a core principle which informs their view on these matters and will enlighten everybody that there is a strong thread of opportunism in the opposition's stance on the issue of territories' rights.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">In closing, I would like to remind people that this does not prevent the federal govern­ment from engaging in a parliamentary debate in order to challenge state or territory legislation that is inconsistent with the Com­monwealth. Any fear campaign to purport that it will is misleading.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Finally, I would like to take this oppor­tunity, because I think it is directly relevant to the subject matter today, to congratulate the new—not so new any more actually—Chief Minister, Katy Gallagher. She is the new Chief Minister following the retirement of former Chief Minister Jon Stanhope. I would like to acknowledge that the transition was a smooth one and that I am extremely proud to work very closely, as I always have, with an ACT assembly, a Chief Minister and an ACT Labor government so focused on the best interests of the people of Canberra. I know they are committed to their ongoing campaign to ensure that they have the democratic right that reflects that of the states and that is commensurate with the status, maturity and broad rights of the people of the ACT.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I commend the bill to the Senate. I was very pleased to speak to it today. I look forward to the government moving the amendments, as they reflect the recommend­ations of the Senate committee, and I will watch with interest what is happening on the other side of the chamber.</span>

                    </a> (<span class="HPS-State">Queensland</span>—<span class="HPS-MinisterialTitles">Deputy Leader of the Opposition in the Senate</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">09:42</span>):  The opposition has always been a strong proponent of the rights of people who live in the territories and, in particular, the rights of people who live in the three territories affected by this bill—the Australian Capital Territory, the Northern Territory and Norfolk Island. We note in particular that the Northern Territory has resumed a movement towards statehood. That was a movement which, in the 1990s, although ultimately defeated, was strongly supported by the then coalition government led by John Howard. I recently met with a bipartisan delegation of parliamentarians from the Northern Territory to discuss the movement towards statehood for the Northern Territory with them.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Equally, the coalition has always been represented in this place by ACT senators—my distinguished friend Senator Gary Humphries, a former Chief Minister of the ACT, and his predecessor, Senator Margaret Reid—who have been very, very ardent advocates for the rights and interests of citizens of the ACT. The issue of statehood for the ACT does not generally arise in these discussions because of the peculiarity of the ACT's constitutional position.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">So respecting the rights of citizens who live in Australia's territories, particularly the two territories represented in the Common­wealth parliament, is core business for us in the coalition. What this bill purports to do is to bring about a fundamental constitutional change to the status of those territories and the relationship of those territories to this parliament. Those of us who take the interests of territorians seriously have grave concerns that, because of the piecemeal, haphazard and sloppy manner in which this is presented to the Senate by the Greens, by Senator Brown, passage of the bill in this form will in fact retard and set back the recognition of the rights of territorians. In particular, having regard to the fact that the process in the Northern Territory is pro­ceeding towards statehood in a methodical and careful way, those who would like to see statehood for the Northern Territory do not want this bill in this form. This is by no means easy. I know Senator Brown enjoys the luxury of pontificating about issues without having the responsibility to put those views into effect. But if Senator Brown had met with voters who are seeking to prosecute the case for Northern Territory statehood—</span>

                    </a>  I know you have, Senator Crossin. I do not doubt your interest in and commitment to this issue. If Senator Brown had met with those people, he would understand better than he does how constitutionally and politically difficult this is. Those who seek to advance the cause of Northern Territory statehood need a gratuitous intervention like this from the Senate like they need a hole in the head. So we will not be supporting this bill. We support the wisdom of the observation made by the Senate Legal and Constitutional Affairs Legislation Committee when it reviewed the legislation and cautioned against a piecemeal approach to issues of self-government. My distinguished colleague Senator Humphries will shortly be moving a second reading amendment and addressing this issue and elaborating further upon what the Senate committee report found. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">There is another reason why the coalition opposes this legislation. We look with a very sceptical eye on anything that comes from Senator Bob Brown and the Greens. With a deeply sceptical eye, we have followed through the media the debate about gay marriage that has riven the Australian Labor Party and the concerns expressed, in particular by former Senator Mike Forshaw and former Senator Steve Hutchins—reflected, by the way, in their dissenting comments in the committee report—that this bill, although on its face a constitutional bill, is in fact being sought to be used as a vehicle for gay marriage to be introduced in the Australian Capital Territory. In forming that sceptical, dare I say somewhat cynical, view of Senator Bob Brown's purposes here, we are emboldened by comments that the former ACT Chief Minister Mr Jon Stanhope made in the context of this debate when Mr Stanhope belled the cat and made it perfectly clear that he would like to use this legislation, were it to be passed, as a vehicle to introduce gay marriage in the ACT. Mr Stanhope—who was a dreadful Chief Minister, a real no-hoper and one of the worst heads of government I have ever come across, on either side of politics, in any state or territory—revealed the purpose and the thinking behind this bill. Whether that purpose is continued by the current ACT Chief Minister I do not know, but at the time this bill was being shaped in the mind of Senator Brown we know what Mr Stanhope thought it would lead to and what he wanted it to lead to.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We know, as I said a moment ago, that on the issue of gay marriage the Labor Party is riven between those who are proponents of that issue and those—particularly the more conservative elements in the Labor Party—who are trenchantly opposed to it. We have no such division on our side of politics. We in the Liberal Party and the National Party support the Howard government's amend­ments to the Marriage Act; we do not support gay marriage. We are not having the argument among ourselves about gay marriage that is tearing the Labor Party to shreds at the moment. We are perfectly prepared to watch from the sidelines as the Labor Party tears itself apart. But anybody who thinks that there are not some in the Labor Party who see this bill as a step towards the enactment of gay marriage within the ACT is either deluded or dishonest. There are many—not all, perhaps not most—in the Australian Labor Party who do see this bill as a pathway to that outcome.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We do not accept the good faith of Senator Brown's public assurances that this bill is purely about the rights of territorians. On its face, as I said before, it is a constitutional bill. On its face, it is a bill of general application, but we know that it is also part of this move to achieve an outcome in relation to the Marriage Act to which we in the coalition are resolutely opposed. For that reason as well, we will be opposing this bill and we will be supporting the second reading amendment which I foreshadowed and which Senator Humphries will outline in his contribution. </span>

                    <a href="7Y6" type="MemberSpeech">
                      <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Senator CROSSIN</span>
                    </a> (<span class="HPS-State">Northern Territory</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">09:53</span>):  I rise to provide a contribution to the debate on the Australian Capital Territory (Self-Government) Amendment (Disallowance and Amendment Power of the Commonwealth) Bill 2010. I do that in two respects: firstly, of course, as one of the two senators from the Northern Territory and, secondly, as Chair of the Legal and Constitutional Affairs Legislation Committee that inquired into this bill earlier this year. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I want to begin by saying that there are some aspects of Senator Brandis's remarks that I tend to agree with and there are some aspects of his remarks that I totally disagree with, and I think that what is happening in the Northern Territory and the views of people who are supporting statehood were a little misconstrued in his contribution. Can I say in providing some input into this debate that I often feel that, representing the Northern Territory, I am a bit like the youngest child in a family of 250 here. Sometimes when you are representing the Northern Territory in this chamber, you feel like you are at the bottom of the pecking order. You feel like you have to fight for every piece of recognition and acknowledge­ment you can get for the Northern Territory. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">For the last 13 years it has always eluded me as to why we are constantly coming into this chamber for debates such as this when we would not have these debates if we were a state or if people somehow did not feel that they could pick on the Northern Territory all the time. They do that by using some sort of hook rather than letting the legally competent, elected governments of the Northern Territory—whether they be under the Country Liberal Party or under the Labor Party—just get on and do the job they are elected to do. They enact euthanasia legislation, but for some reason here in Canberra, if we do not like it, we think we can overturn it. They enact mandatory sentencing legislation, but for some reason here in Canberra, if we do not like it, we will overturn it. People fought to keep euthanasia laws; people here overturned them. People wanted to keep mandatory sentencing laws; people here wanted to overturn them. It is always about an issue when you come to the Territory. It is never about the competency of the governments. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I have lived in the Northern Territory for 30 years. Let me tell you: there are some laws that the CLP enacted that I did not particularly like at all, but I did not think that that was a key for me to open the door to Canberra and say, 'Overturn the legislation.' I think people down here have got to get out of that mind-set and totally get off picking on the Northern Territory and its government, no matter which party leads that government. Just leave us alone. Just let us get on with governing in our own right. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We inquired into this piece of legislation. It is not a comprehensive review of the self-governing aspects of the ACT and the Northern Territory, and we make those strong recommendations here. I look at the amendment that Senator Humphries wants to make, and in some respects perhaps that does need to happen, but at least I am saying, 'Pass this piece of legislation,' because this piece of legislation could become law while a review of the self-governing acts is occur­ring. I will get on to why I would not support that for the Territory in a minute. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">What this bill simply does is remove the power of the executive government to veto legislation that has been enacted in the territories. That is all it simply does. It stops somebody in the executive arm of the federal government deciding they do not like a piece of legislation that has been enacted in the Northern Territory or the ACT. But it still leaves in place the provision for this federal parliament to overturn a piece of legislation. To me, that is not good enough either. I think the Territory government should be allowed to just get on with what it is competently elected to do. But for me at least this is a first point of call. At least we could be assured in the Northern Territory that one particular minister or one particular Prime Minister of any governing party in this country could not go off to the Governor-General or the Administrator and seek to overturn a piece of legislation. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">So is this a perfect piece of legislation? It is not a comprehensive piece of legislation in terms of the self- governing act of the territories, but at least it is one start. You could argue: 'Let<span style="&#xD;&#xA;    font-family:Tahoma;&#xD;&#xA;  ">'</span>s not do it at all. Let<span style="&#xD;&#xA;    font-family:Tahoma;&#xD;&#xA;  ">'</span>s do a comprehensive review.' But I think at least it gives the people of the Northern Territory some confidence to know that not one single person or one part of the executive govern­ment will be overturning legislation. Unfor­tunately, it does leave the door open, as I said, for this federal parliament to overturn legislation. Can I go to some of the remarks that Senator Brandis had to make on behalf of the opposition. You cannot step away from the fact that both the Chief Minister of the ACT at the time, Jon Stanhope, and the current Chief Minister of the Northern Terri­tory, Paul Henderson, flew specifically to Canberra. Jon Stanhope made himself specifically available to appear before the Senate Legal and Constitutional Affairs Legislation Committee to support this legislation. That in itself showed me that both those governments and parliaments supported this legislation.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Another thing that impressed me, not only as a Territorian but as chair of that commit­tee, was that members of the Northern Territory Legislative Assembly Standing Committee on Legal and Constitutional Affairs flew here, including the Hon. Jane Aagaard and Kezia Purick. Members of that committee were in person at the committee hearings here in Canberra. I want to impress on people here that that was a bipartisan committee. That was a bipartisan attempt, to come down here and say, 'This legislation is okay; we support it.' But really what we in the Northern Territory are trying to do is get support for statehood. That is the endgame here. A 10-year process has been put in place by the Northern Territory government, which has been supported by the opposition. I am very impressed by the way in which both political parties have worked towards achieving this outcome. There has been a five-year consultation period and there will now be a five-year period of actually drafting a constitution and working out exactly the questions we will be asking Territorians.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This is where I differ from the comments that Senator Brandis put on record. The Chief Minister of the Northern Territory did come down here and, in endorsing the bill's proposals as they pertain to the Northern Territory, said:</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">It is a very basic principle that we are arguing for here. The 25 members of the Territory parliament, who make laws for the good governance of the people of the Northern Territory, are elected by Territorians and they are accountable through fixed-term elections … For the Commonwealth executive arm of government to have the power, essentially at the stroke of a pen, to make a recommendation to the Governor-General to disallow a law in the Territory undermines democracy in the Northern Territory.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">So, yes, he was supportive of this legislation. However, both he and the members of the Northern Territory legal and constitutional committee fervently put to us that the endgame for them is a move to statehood. That is what they really want. In your pro­posed amendment, Senator Humphries, you seek not to consider this bill but only to consider the interests of the ACT, in examining the self-government act for the ACT. I say to myself again: the Northern Territory would miss out on both counts here. We would not get this legislation through and support the wishes of the Northern Territory parliament, the submitters and the representatives of the Northern Territory. This amendment does not suggest that we would look at a move to statehood in the Northern Territory. We do not want the self-government act in the Northern Territory reviewed. We actually want an endgame where, essentially, that act is repealed. So this amendment is not a win for the Territory either.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">But I think we need to clearly understand that this piece of legislation 'ought to be about votes, not about vetoes'. That is a phrase that was written yesterday by a journalist in the <span style="font-style:italic;">Age</span>. It ought to be about democracy, not about particular issues. It ought to be about, at least, taking a first step in recognising that the Northern Territory has competent governments. Those govern­ments are elected by the people of the Northern Territory, just like the New South Wales and the Victorian parliaments are elected by the people of New South Wales and Victoria. They put legislation in from time to time that people do not like, and that also happens in every other state in this country. But what this bill seeks to do is ensure that those laws are not overturned by the executive government of the federal ruling party. That is all we are asking for in this legislation.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">It is a first step. It is not the best step and it is not the step that we want to achieve at the end of the day. We want to see legisla­tion go through this parliament that grants the Northern Territory statehood in our own right. This is another example of where you have to come in here time and time again and keep flying the flag for the Northern Territory. It somehow eludes me why it is always the case that people here in this building believe that they can continually interfere in what is happening in the Northern Territory. This is one piece of legislation where, for a change, we would get some positive interference. Yet it seems it will not be supported unanimously in this chamber.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I am speaking in support of this legislation, but I am speaking more in support of the view that the Senate Legal and Constitutional Affairs Legislation Committee expressed in section 3.6.1 of this report:</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">The committee places on record its strong support for statehood in the NT …</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">The committee would also welcome any opportunity to work cooperatively with the NT Legislative Assembly Standing Committee on Legal and Constitutional Affairs towards achieving that goal.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I can say that, as Chair of the Senate Legal and Constitutional Affairs Legislation Committee, it is an issue that we will pick up and write to that committee about. Perhaps for the first time in the history of this coun­try, we might see a standing committee at a federal level and a state level come together to hold an inquiry or do some work together to achieve that outcome. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">But let us be very clear here: what we want in the Northern Territory is statehood. We want to get to it in a measured way and in a bipartisan way where people of the Northern Territory are comfortable and confident about that on the day they vote yes. This legislation is just one step on the journey. It removes the power of the exec­utive arm to overturn our laws. Unfortunate­ly, it still leaves provision for the federal parliament to overturn our laws, and that is still not good enough. But, at the end of the day, this bill is certainly worthy of support. Unfortunately, Senator Humphries, I think that your amendment, again, really ignores the wishes and the wills of the Northern Territory and that there would be no benefit for us if your amendment actually succeeded.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Small">   "the Senate declines to consider the bill further, and:   (a)   notes the comments of the Legal and Constitutional Affairs Legislation Committee on the bill that "an approach which fails to look at the broad range of issues affecting the autonomy of the ACT and the NT may not be the most appropriate way of addressing outstanding self-determination matters in those territories, and may not ultimately represent the most considered solution. The committee believes that a system­atic and holistic review of self-government arrangements in the ACT and the NT holds merit, and would help to address some of the specific issues raised during this inquiry.";   (b)   affirms that the process by which the Australian territories move towards greater legislative independence, consistent with the overall framework of the Australian Federation, should continue, but that a more systematic and comprehensive approach is to be preferred; and   (c)   calls for a full review of the <span style="font-style:italic;">Australian Capital Territory (Self-Government) Act 1988</span> in lieu of piecemeal amendments to that Act".</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I will come back to speak about that a little more later. The question that I ask today in looking at the Australian Capital Territory (Self-Government) Amendment (Disallow­ance and Amendment Power of the Commonwealth) Bill 2010 that Senator Bob Brown has put before the chamber is: what garments does that ultimate populist, Senator Brown, parade around in the Senate today? He appears to be wearing the clothes of the friend of the territories—the man who cares deeply about territorians and their rights to make decisions for themselves, the man who is the champion of regional autonomy, the man who stands up for Canberra against the federal government. This disallowance bill is brought forward to prevent the ACT, the Northern Territory or Norfolk Island being pushed around by ministers in a federal government. This bill gives expression, presumably, to ideals of self-determination which were inherent in the self-government acts of the 1970s and 1980s.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">There is something about that image of Senator Bob Brown today which does not seem quite right. Something does not quite gel about Senator Brown as the champion of the second tier of government in this country. Something is more akin to a masquerade than to reality, because I recall a very differently attired Bob Brown not all that long ago. I recall that Dr Bob Brown, as he then was, came to national attention in the 1980s as the scourge of the Tasmanian government that wanted to build a certain dam, and Dr Brown argued that the conflict over the dam to be built in Tasmania should be resolved in a certain way. How did he want that resolved? He wanted it resolved by the federal government interfering and inter­vening in the affairs of the self-governing Tasmanian polity to stop the building of that dam. Where were the rights of territory or state governments at that stage of Senator Brown's career?</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">People might say that perhaps Senator Brown today feels differently about the territories than he felt about Tasmania back in the 1980s. He is now a member of parliament; perhaps he has a different view. I am not sure that that is the case either. Senator Brown's record with respect to the territories is not a lot better. I look at Senator Brown's bill, the Human Rights (Mandatory Sentencing of Juvenile Offenders) Bill 1999, which was introduced by Senator Brown to override the rights of the self-governing Northern Territory to legislate in favour of mandatory sentences for certain people committing crimes. Senator Brown was unhappy with that and was quite comfortable in 1999 to introduce legislation to override the rights of the Northern Territory to legislate in that way. I have had this debate with Senator Brown before and I know what he is going to say. He is going to say, 'We were justified in intervening in the affairs of the Northern Territory at that time because we were dealing with a fundamental human rights matter which cut across Australia's international obligations under treaties; therefore, despite the principle which I strongly adhere to being violated, it was okay to intervene in the Northern Territory on that occasion.' </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Unfortunately, Senator Brown's record of intervention in the affairs of self-governing states or territories does not end there, because in 2003 Senator Brown returned to this issue with a motion of disallowance. Bear in mind that he is now moving a bill in the Senate to stop disallowance of territory legislation. Back in 2003 Senator Brown was quite happy to move a motion of disallow­ance in this place to prevent a certain road project proceeding in the Australian Capital Territory, the widening of the Gungahlin Drive extension, despite the fact that it was supported by the then territory government, because Senator Brown did not approve of the building of that road. He did not like the idea of that road being built and did he want the territory to make its own decision about that at that stage? No, he did not. He knew better. He would bring the might of the federal parliament down on the ACT and prevent the building of that road.</span>

                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Senator Brown has no credibility on such issues. Senator Brown is no friend of territory autonomy. He is in this respect an opportunist, happy to champion the rights of territorians to legislate when he agrees with what they propose to do with that power and equally happy to trash territory rights when he believes that his interests are not being served. You may say that today he is not talking about the right to interfere or not; he is talking about the way that you interfere. At the end of the day, Senator Brown, it does not really make much difference. If you are going to do somebody over, the way in which you do it does not have as much bearing on the matter as the fact that you are doing them over in the first place.</span>
                </p>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The coalition is not going to play along with the cynical game that Senator Brown is playing here today. There are serious issues about the form and the effectiveness of self-government, certainly in the ACT, and I suspect my colleague Senator Scullion—and we have heard from Senator Crossin already—will flag questions about the effectiveness of self-government arrange­ments in the Northern Territory. Those are real issues which deserve systematic, careful examination by the federal parliament, not piecemeal legislation designed more for political purposes than to advance a system­atic examination of what is wrong and what needs to be fixed about the institution of self-government in those places. This bill does not address those fundamental issues, issues that Senator Crossin talked about that I know vex Senator Scullion. This bill is an oppor­tunistic intervention to clothe the Greens in the most favourable electoral light, not an attempt to fix what I think we all know needs to be addressed.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I have moved a second reading amendment which first of all acknowledges the findings of the Senate Legal and Constitutional Affairs Legislation Committee that there are issues which simply have to be addressed and which this legislation does not address. The second reading amendment affirms the process by which the states and territories move towards greater legislative independence consistent with the framework of Australian Federation. In the case of the Northern Territory, that may well include statehood within a few years. That is probably not the case for the ACT, but certainly the ACT's need to overhaul the institution of self-government, which is now more than 22 years old, is a real and urgent need and, again, the piecemeal approach taken by this legislation is not a satisfactory solution to that problem. The amendment calls for a full review of the Australian Capital Territory (Self-Government) Act. If a colleague, particularly Senator Scullion, supports the view that the Northern Territory should also be included in such a review, I am very happy for that to occur. Indeed I would foreshadow that in the next few sitting days Senator Scullion and I will put forward a matter for the Senate to consider with respect to the question of the structure and future of self-government in the Northern Territory and the ACT.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I hear the support of the Labor Party for this bill and I note that there is a pretty large measure of cynicism in that position as well. I recall it was only three years ago that the Labor Party was perfectly content to support the decision of then Prime Minister Kevin Rudd to intervene, through the disallowance power, to overrule the then-proposed resurgence of civil unions legislation in the ACT—legislation which had been proposed during the Howard government and which the ACT government came back to propose again when the Rudd government was elected. Of course, the Rudd government at that stage rebuffed that suggestion very clearly, and the senators who today rise to tell us what a wonderful idea this bill is were perfectly happy to use that power back in 2008.</span>

It is about how decisions are made affecting the powers of territories. It is not a substantive bill about those powers, and those issues do need to be addressed and in other ways they will be addressed. I would prefer that they were addressed through a comprehensive review of the status of self-government, not through some piecemeal approach. That is the appropriate way to deal with this. I represent the ACT. I understand what I think the people of this territory aspire to and want. I do not think they want the institution of self-government to be toyed with by federal politicians. They want these issues to be dealt with systematically and comprehensively. I believe the citizens of this territory would welcome an opportunity to engage in a full, comprehensive consult­ative process to examine the status of self-government here. That is the better approach, not the approach inherent in this very piecemeal piece of legislation.</span>

                    </a> (<span class="HPS-State">Tasmania</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">10:17</span>):  I rise to make a contribution to the debate on the Australian Capital Territory (Self-Government) Amendment (Disallowance and Amendment Power of the Common­wealth) Bill 2010. Obviously, I rise as a senator from what is clearly Australia's smallest state, but a state that has had responsible government for over 150 years and one that is fiercely attached to its democratic institutions. Tasmania is also a place with a profound sense of identity—an island which has a particular tradition, a unique history and strong sense of commun­ity. Tasmania is a special place, a place with which I am deeply connected, and a place to which as a citizen—as a Tasmanian—I feel a sense of belonging. I belong to Tasmania. And Tasmania belongs to those communities who have had the honour of calling themselves Tasmanians.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We have the oft-remarked right of being well represented in this place, a right that allows our members of parliament to connect with our constituents at a very close level. At a state level, we have a particular electoral system, one which I know the other Tasmanian senators in this place know very well. It is the Hare-Clark system—shared with one of the territories with which this bill is concerned—which gives people the oppor­tunity to choose from amongst a wide range of candidates to find the one who best reflects their views and by whom they want to be represented. If those views are not carried to the parliament and reflected in the laws of the state, then the representative will be held to account at the next election. This is a very basic expectation of a democracy. And it is a very basic conclusion of the kind of belonging about which I spoke a moment ago. When one of those elements is not present in a system of governance, then it is difficult to call that system fully democratic. It is difficult to say that connection between a people and their place has been respected.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The way the law operates at the moment does not respect the important principle that people should be able to elect people to represent them, and that those represent­atives should have the capacity to deliver on the promises that they make and the values they espouse. This bill is about enabling the Australian Capital Territory and the Northern Territory to shape their own futures in a more democratic way. Both territories have proven themselves over a long period of time to be more than capable of governing them­selves in a responsible way, in the same web of interdependency between the levels of government in which the states participate. In fact, the ACT especially has led the way on a number of issues, and I want to take a moment to reflect on the very positive legacy left by Jon Stanhope and, in doing that, reject the characterisation of him made earlier in this place by Senator Brandis. Under Jon Stanhope's leadership, and importantly reflecting the values of the people of the ACT, his government led the nation on issues of rights, an important example of which is the Human Rights Charter.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This bill does not remove the interdepend­ency and the checks and balances we expect in a federal and a national democracy. Under this bill, there remains parliamentary over­sight of the territories, and I am sure that is an issue about which future debates will rage. But it is notable that this bill is relative­ly conservative in that sense. It is not a wide-ranging constitutional reform. It is about honouring the principles of democracy that we have already declared in this place, some time ago, and the will of territorians as reflected in their legislative assemblies. And when there is a conflict between those wills, or if there is a need to act separately to territorial legislators, we will have a debate in this place, as we should. We should have to put our case in detail on particular issues. We should have to respect that the destiny of the territory should be up to the territories unless we can justify intervention.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">No doubt governance in this country is a complex matter and the issues involved are complex. We have international obligations and we have national priorities. We have differing levels of capacity in our different institutions. But what should underpin all of that is an understanding that the will of the people should be respected wherever it is most clearly expressed. I believe, in this case, that this means we should respect the laws enacted by our territorial assemblies. As we are aware, these territories were created by acts of this parliament. Their legislatures are rightly subject to the deliberations of this parliament, not executive government. It is important that the Commonwealth parlia­ment enable the ACT and Northern Territory legislative assemblies to be independent, to be responsible and to be accountable to their citizens. That is what I believe this parlia­ment is for and what Australians expect. Australians do not expect people elected for a different role to be able to override the will of the territories lightly.</span>

                    </a> (<span class="HPS-State">Western Australia</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">10:24</span>):  This bill is another example of the Green tail wagging the Labor dog. It has nothing to do with wanting to improve the self-governing arrangements that apply in the territories. This started in 2006 when the Howard government decided to exercise section 35 of the ACT act to disallow the ACT Civil Unions Bill. That is what got this process underway. If you look at this bill as it was originally introduced by the Greens, it did not then mention anybody other than the ACT. This had nothing to do with wanting to improve self-governing arrangements for the territories in Australia; it was entirely and exclusively driven by the Greens' desire to stop the then Howard government and subsequent governments preventing the ACT government legislating for civil unions in the Australian Capital Territory. In 2006 the Howard government made that decision and, as Senator Humphries indicated, Kevin Rudd as the then Prime Minister in 2009 took a very similar view. Because he had good relations with the then ACT Chief Minister, Jon Stanhope, no doubt they were able to organise these things behind closed doors and did not have to run through the whole process. But the effect was the same.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I want to correct something that Senator Lundy said. Senator Lundy suggested this is somehow about restoring territory rights, as if it were going to take things back to somewhere they had been before. The capacity for Commonwealth governments to make the sorts of decisions that the Howard government did in 2006 has been in this relevant legislation as part of the self-government arrangements since the word go. This is not new; this is not just something that came out of nowhere in 2006. The Howard government exercised an existing section in the existing act. As Senator Brandis and Senator Humphries have said, and as I am sure Senator Scullion will say, the coalition is very supportive of having a comprehensive look at how self-government arrangements can be improved. But this is not what is driving the Greens. The Greens are being driven by their social agenda in relation to same-sex marriage, euthanasia and other bits and pieces for which they cannot get support, despite repeated attempts, in any of the state parliaments. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">As Senator Humphries indicated, it is not as if the Greens are consistent on this. There have been times when Senator Brown has wanted the federal government to overturn the state government of Tasmania on some­thing happening in that state. And when it came to mandatory sentencing laws in the Northern Territory Senator Brown was quite happy to see the Commonwealth override the Northern Territory legislation at that point in time. This has got nothing to do with a genuine commitment to improving the rights of territorians; this is entirely and exclusively driven by Senator Brown's desire to see legislation on civil unions and same-sex marriage and euthanasia become more achievable in the sorts of parliaments where he thinks that this sort of legislation has a chance to get up. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I just reflect on the fact that in 1997 this parliament voted to overturn the Northern Territory euthanasia laws. Whatever any­body's views on the substance of that matter, it was no doubt at the time a divisive debate. I was not involved as it was before my time. However, the Commonwealth parliament voted to overturn the Northern Territory euthanasia laws. No doubt that would have been a time when there would have been some robust debate inside the Northern Territory, among the good people of the Northern Territory, about how it could be that the Commonwealth parliament could do this. It was the year after the Commonwealth parliament here in Canberra made a decision about laws enacted by the Northern Territory in relation to euthanasia that the proposition of the Northern Territory becoming a state was put to a referendum. History shows that the people of the Northern Territory decided that they did not want to become a state at that point. I hear what Senator Crossin is saying and no doubt Senator Scullion will have similar views, and I know there is a bipartisan effort in the Northern Territory to continue the path towards statehood. I wish them very good luck with it. But right now the situation is that it is the Northern 'Territory'. The reason that is still the situation is because the people of the Northern Territory in 1998 voted against statehood. I was drawn to the additional comments that were made by former Labor Senators Forshaw and Hutchins, who were part of the inquiry into this legislation. I have to observe here that the fact the Australian Labor Party has decided to support this legislation is a very sad reflection on the current state of the Labor Party. The Labor Party once had courageous senators, like former Senators Hutchins and Forshaw, who were able to assess legislation as they saw it. I will just read from their comments:</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Small">It is not surprising that this Bill is technically flawed. Both this bill, and a previous bill proposed by Senator Brown in 2006, originally applied only to the ACT.

The proposed amendments to include the NT and Norfolk Island appear to have been an afterthought without any consideration of the consequences detailed above.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Former Labor Senators Forshaw and Hutchins do make the observation that the territories are not states.

                  <span class="HPS-Small">This is not the expressed intention of the Bill. Any move toward statehood should be approach­ed in a serious and considered manner not piecemeal nor as a reaction to a particular decision.</span>

I think that Senator Farrell has been sold a pup. I think that Senator Farrell should try and show a little bit of courage like former Senators Hutchins and Forshaw did. He is now part of an Australian Labor Party that will facilitate either civil unions legislation or same-sex marriage legislation in the Australian Capital Territory. If Senator Farrell's intention is not to see that happen then he should support an amendment to rule it out in the legislation here today. I can see that he is distracted and is not prepared to listen to the debate that is going on, even though he is here represent­ing the government. Hopefully somebody back in his office is taking clear note.</span>

This has not been initiated by the Australian Labor Party government. This has been initiated by the Greens and the Labor Party is just hopping in and backing it up. Why? If you are serious about improving self-government arrange­ments for the ACT and the Northern Territory, go about it in a serious way. Go about it in a strategic way, support a proper review, support a proper approach that does not sort out these things in a piecemeal fashion just because Senator Brown was upset that the Howard government exercised section 35 of the Australian Capital Territory (Self-Government) Act to disallow civil unions in the Australian Capital Territory. Senator Farrell, you might have been given assurances in the ALP caucus that this would not lead to legalisation of same-sex marriage, but the Chief Minister's office refused to rule it out when they were asked about it:</span>

There are going to be people across Australia who are going to reflect very seriously on whether they should support the Greens-wagged Australian Labor Party or whether they should go to a true Labor party. I suspect you will find that people will turn away from the Australian Labor Party because of their support for bad pieces of legislation like this.</span>

                    </a> (<span class="HPS-State">Northern Territory</span>—<span class="HPS-MinisterialTitles">Deputy Leader of The Nationals</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">10:37</span>):  It is very rare for me to rise in this place and feel sorry for those on the other side, particularly for my colleague from the Northern Territory, but I think it is reasonable to put on the public record why they are taking this position. The reason my heart goes out to them is I am actually quite sure the leather is softer on that side. It is a long time since I sat over there, but it was certainly a lot more comfortable. There are a lot of benefits that go with government which make you want to stay on that side.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The sad thing about Labor's position is that it has had a very light spray of green over all of its motives. It is really important to have a look at the motive today. Senator Crossin stood in this place today, as she always does on any issues in regard to the Northern Territory, and said that we are moving along towards statehood. I have been very pleased to stand in this place on the most recent issue, legislating for euthanasia, and I support her in that regard. If you look at the motive for all of this behaviour, it is simply to stay in government. That is the rawest deal. Of course the Greens have a great deal of influence, as they should in those circumstances, to ensure that this government does what it is told. Today we see the Labor government being pretty compliant and the Greens should be very pleased with that—it seems to be behaving appropriately and it is not being too naughty or doing things that the Greens do not require.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">If we are looking to motive, perhaps we should examine the Greens' motives. Motive is very important in life. Why is it that we are moving along with this? Why is it that, suddenly, Bob Brown has a terrific love affair with the territories? He is very keen on the territories and on the people who live in the territories, but he is particularly keen on the legislation in the Northern Territory. As has been indicated today, Bob Brown hardly seems to have a consistent approach. He is, today, basically saying that the Common­wealth should not interfere with the Northern Territory or with the Australian Capital Territory—'The poor devils, we should allow them exactly the same rights as a state.' It sure seems odd. I do not know whether it was a different bloke, but whoever it was, Senator Brown, I recall him standing in here saying: 'Let's overturn the mandatory sentencing laws in the Territory. How dare they take their own stand in the Northern Territory and have their own rights to determine how they deal with the criminal justice system. Let's use the Common­wealth's powers in this place, in this Senate, to overturn them.' You can understand why I am a little bit confused in that regard.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I wonder what the motive is. You cannot accuse the Greens of not being organised or of not having a motive. They do have a motive. There is a very clear motive here and it has been indicated earlier. The cat has already been belled. If Katy Gallagher was not happy to stand up and say that this is all about introducing same-sex marriages in the Australian Capital Territory, the previous Chief Minister, Mr Stanhope, certainly was. He said: 'Absolutely. Looking forward to introducing same-sex marriages in the Australian Capital Territory.' In regard to this piece of legislation that those on the other side have been forced to accept, they have been given foolish assurances and have been foolish to accept those assurances. Those on the other side have accepted that that is the case.</span>

                    </a>  Of course Gallagher did not rule it out because that is exactly what is going to happen. As sure as night follows day this will happen. Perhaps I can just briefly paint the picture of how it will occur. This legislation does, in effect, say that instead of using an executive arm of government to deal with issues that are not within a state's capacity to legislate on—things like marriage, starting your own navy, having your own currency, taxation and immigration—if the territories play with that area, we are going to have to come back and have a full debate in parliament. That takes a bit of time. The scenario is that, if the Australian Capital Territory passes a law on Monday, we might have a bit of a think about recalling parliament, if that is the will of the government, and maybe we will have an emergency session a week later. If, during that period of time, people are lawfully married, for example, in the Australian Capital Territory, what happens to them? They were lawfully married. Does the Commonwealth then come back and say, 'We've got some weird retrospectivity in all of this about how we unwind this mess.'</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">That is what I believe the motive for this is. If you wish to have same-sex marriages, there is a process to do that. I argued strongly in this place during the debate on one of the previous contributions from Senator Brown in the Restoring Territory Rights (Voluntary Euthanasia Legislation) Bill 2010. I know that Senator Brown is a strong proponent of introducing euthanasia. I supported that bill not on the basis of whether I thought euthanasia legislation was being supported but because it is entirely the right of a state to make that decision. I also would expect, if the Northern Territory decided to start its own navy and its own currency or decided to start its own immigration system, that there would be an immediate action from the executive to deal with that. That is just a little about motive. Without a doubt that is what is going to happen.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Those people on the other side who think they are not part of something that will lead to what I have just described are, at best, fools. I know the comfort, vaguely recalled in my distant past, of being on that side. But remember: when this happens, your constituents will remember those who led them to that circumstance. If you want to introduce same-sex marriage, there is a way to go about that: you come to this place—because it is the Commonwealth which should legislate on those matters. Do not use some sort of a backdoor agenda to deal with these issues. Sadly, in the Northern Territory a few people are quite excited. They have rung me and said that they are really excited that this is going to give them more rights in the Territory. Once they have all the infor­mation they then understand that this is not another step forward in moving towards statehood.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I would just like to speak briefly about the foreshadowed amendment from Senator Humphries. Senator Crossin said: 'This is something we can't possibly support because it doesn't do anything for the Northern Territory.' I agree with that. She said, 'We don't want the self-government act revised.' Of course I agree: we want it abolished; we want to move to statehood. The Australian Capital Territory and the legislative framework are in an entirely different place to where we are in the Northern Territory, so I agree completely with her.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I would like Senator Crossin and people in the Territory to reflect on another contri­bution from Senator Humphries. In the next week of parliament we will be jointly submitting a process that will start a fair dinkum look at self-government in the Aust­ralian Capital Territory and the movement to statehood in the Northern Territory. It is not just a process on a couple of very small squeaky wheels. This will be a fair dinkum process with the motive of moving to strengthen self-government in the Australian Capital Territory and moving to statehood in the Northern Territory. That is the motive. That is what it will be about.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">For those Territorians who think that this will somehow advance statehood, I can promise you that being astride a green horse with squeaky wheels is not the way to move forward. Look to the motive. This is an insult to those people who are actually striving for statehood in the Northern Territory and looking for stronger self-government in the Australian Capital Territory because it is about none of those things. On this side, we are clear-eyed and bright and we can see through the motive for this legislation. We do not accept that this is about strengthening issues for the Northern Territory and the Australian Capital Territory. That is why we will not be supporting this legislation.</span>

                    </a> (<span class="HPS-State">Tasmania</span>—<span class="HPS-MinisterialTitles">Minister Assisting on Deregulation and Public Sector Superannuation, Minister for Small Business and Minister Assisting the Minister for Tourism</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">10:46</span>):  I rise as the responsible minister, representing the Minister for Regional Australia, Regional Development and Local Government, Mr Crean, to contribute to the debate on behalf of the government. On 4 May 2011, the Senate Legal and Constitutional Affairs Legislation Committee reported back to the Senate on its inquiry into the Australian Capital Territory Self-Government) Amendment (Disallow­ance and Amendment Power of the Comm­onwealth) Bill 2010, together with proposed amendments applying to the Northern Territory and Norfolk Island. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The bill and amendments circulated by the Greens sought to abolish the power of the Governor-General to disallow or recommend amendments to territory legislation by repealing section 35 of the Australian Capital Territory (Self-Government) Act 1988, section 9 of the Northern Territory (Self-Government) Act 1978 and section 23 of the Norfolk Island Act 1979. That is what this bill is about. It is moved by the Greens to abolish the power of the Governor-General to disallow or recommend amendments to territory legislation. It is not about a whole range of other issues, some of which have been touched on. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The committee report contained two recommendations. The first recommendation of the committee is that the Senate pass the disallowance bill subject to the following amendments: firstly, the disallowance bill apply only to the ACT and the Northern Territory; secondly, the removal of referen­ces in clause 4 of the bill that purport to provide relevant territory legislatures with exclusive legislative authority and responsi­bility for making laws; and, thirdly, clause 4 be further amended to more accurately reflect the current power of the Governor-General to recommend amendments to territory laws. The second recommendation is that Norfolk Island be excluded from the operation of the disallowance bill until further evidence is provided on the need for change in that jurisdiction.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The government agrees with the object­ives of this bill in removing the power of the federal executive to override legislation in the ACT and the Northern Territory. However, given the technical amendments required, the government has circulated its own amendments to this bill. Again, I emphasise that this bill is about removing the power of the federal executive to override legislation in the ACT and the Northern Territory. The issues that have been referred to—whether it is euthanasia or same sex marriage—are determined and governed by other legislation of the Commonwealth. Those issues are not what this legislation is about.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The amendments will support the repeal of section 35 of the Commonwealth Austra­lian Capital Territory (Self-Government) Act 1988 and section 9 of the Northern Territory (Self-Government) Act 1978 and incorporate the committee's suggested amendments. The government agrees with recommendation 2 of the committee that Norfolk Island should be excluded from the operation of the disallowance bill, given the differences between Norfolk Island and other self-governing territories. The recent passage of the Territories Law Reform Act 2010 also provides the Commonwealth with increased oversight and scrutiny of Norfolk Island legislation to ensure it is consistent with the national interest. It would therefore be inconsistent for the disallowance bill to apply to Norfolk Island.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The bill before the Senate today, with amendments that I have outlined, will remove the ability of the executive govern­ment to veto legislation enacted by the ACT and the Northern Territory legislatures. As these acts stand, the executive has the power to override the decision of the democratically elected legislatures of the ACT and the Northern Territory. This bill goes to the rights of those in the territories to determine the good governance of the communities in which they live. The architects of the Constitution predicted that there may be times when the national interest must be considered when looking at territory laws. That is why they drafted section 122 that allows the parliament, not exclusively the executive, to make laws for the government of any territory. As I have already said, this parliament still will have a right to determine laws in respect to the territories. This legislation that we are considering is about removing the power of the executive but not this parliament. For all these reasons, the government will support the passage of the bill with these amendments.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">A second reading amendment has been moved by Senator Humphries. The govern­ment will not be supporting the amendment. I will make a couple of brief remarks as to why we will not be supporting it. Firstly, the issues raised in the amendment have been canvassed in the Senate inquiry into the bill. The committee concluded—in its majority report, at least—that the bill would improve the democratic rights of the people of the ACT and the Northern Territory and the passage of the bill would provide just recognition of the maturity and capacity of the ACT and Northern Territory legislative assemblies since they attained self-government.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The Australian government has already indicated to the ACT government that it would welcome a review of the ACT (Self-Government) Act. Such a review should be driven by the ACT government and its citizens, and the Australian government would welcome considering such a review. The timing of a comprehensive review should not delay the implementation of the practical democratic benefits provided by this bill.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I note that both the ACT and Northern Territory Chief Ministers are on the record—or at least, in the case of the ACT, the previous Chief Minister; I am not aware of anything on the record from the current Chief Minister—as supporting the bill. For those reasons, the government will not support the second reading amendment.</span>

I will not go over in detail the reasons for the Australian Capital Territory (Self-Government) Amendment (Disallowance and Amendment Power of the Commonwealth) Bill 2010 because it has already been before the parliament and indeed through a thorough committee process, with the committee having endorsed the bill as it comes before the Senate today.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I note that there will be a number of amendments from the government.

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">and that is what is in process here today. A couple of decades ago this same parliament legislated to transfer its power under the Constitution to make laws for the territories to the executive—that is, the minister of the day. As has been noted in public debate, that means that with the stroke of a pen a minister can override the outcome of a deliberated vote following a debate of the elected representatives of the assemblies either in Canberra, in relation to the ACT, or in Darwin, in relation to the Northern Territory. This bill simply goes back to where the Constitution would have it—that is, the territories will effectively legislate unless or until a vote of both houses of parliament overrules legislation or passes legislation for either of the territories. We cannot change that provision of section 122 or section 123, which also deals with limitations on the powers of the states, unless we go to a referendum.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">There is the prospect that the Northern Territory, which I think is moving in that direction again, will eventually end up subject to a referendum. I would not discount the possibility, as others have, that in some future time Australians might want to give the growing population of the Australian Capital Territory the ability to have self-determination through a form of statehood which will provide for all the amenities of this being the national capital but will provide for enhanced powers for the people of the Australian Capital Territory. That is a matter for a future debate.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This legislation today simply restores at least the right of the assemblies to pass legislation for their citizens without being overridden by a minister without reference to this parliament. It is as simple as that. I take on board the issues of equal marriage and euthanasia that have been raised in here by the opposition today, but they know full well—Senator Humphries knows very well—that this legislation does not alter that. In fact, it enhances the powers of the Australian Capital Territory to legislate at least in the matter of equal marriage, if it wants to, but that is entirely a matter for the territory, as it is a matter for New South Wales, South Australia, Queensland, Western Australia and Tasmania.</span>

                    </a>  Senator Cormann interrupts. If he does not think that is a right that the people of the Northern Territory or the ACT should have and if the opposition in this place wants to have that right withheld from the people of the territories, it is flying in the face of its own history, because it was Mr Kevin Andrews who brought in the legislation that overrode the ability of the territories to legislate in the matter of euthanasia back in 1996, and it was passed by both these houses. That is a prohibition which is not altered by this legislation today. That prohibition, which was supported by a free vote of both chambers—I voted against it, but it was still supported by a free vote of both chambers, with a majority of three, as I recollect, in the Senate—will remain on the Northern Territory assembly and on the ACT assembly unless or until some future vote of this parliament changes it. In that sense, this does not restore or give the measure of equality of the territories with the states that you might think at the outset.</span>

                    </a>  Senator Brandis repeats that it is the case that within the Liberal Party—note the name—members do not have the ability to have a free vote on what should be a matter of conscience. But that is up to that party and its several members to determine; it is not a matter which relates to this vote today. This legisla­tion is important in enhancing democracy. It is one of the four pillars of the Greens party's established philosophy that we do enhance democracy where we can. I notice some criticism that I have moved in the past to have the parliament—never to have a minister but to have the parliament—use these powers to, for example, override the locking up of Aboriginal children in jail in the Northern Territory because they stole biscuits. We will remember the outcome of that, which was that the legislation did pass the Senate. It went to the House and then Prime Minister Howard contacted the Chief Minister of the Northern Territory and offered the funding which ceased that practice of locking up Indigenous children, which had led to a horrible outcome regarding one child. It has not occurred since then, so it was an outcome which was worth while at that time. The ability of the parlia­ment to legislate or to put pressure upon the territories remains under this legislation. There is nothing inconsistent with my behaviour in wanting good outcomes and the proposal that is before the Senate today.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">That said, we will oppose Senator Humphries's effort to not have this bill considered. I would have thought voting it down is one thing; to try and put it on the never-never and come to no conclusion, as Senator Humphries wants to do, to leave the voters of the ACT and the Northern Territory in limbo, would be the worst outcome possible. It is bucking the need for there to be a determination. Finally, I thank the chief ministers of both territories for their support, and most recently Katy Gallagher, the Chief Minister of the Australian Capital Territory.

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">As Senator Brown has referred to, and as I referred to in passing in my second reading speech, we have had the Senate Legal and Constitutional Affairs Legislation Committee report and the amendments reflect the issues raised in the report. We note that the private senator's bill was referred to the Senate Legal and Constitutional Affairs Legislation Com­mittee for consideration on 2 March 2011. While the Senate committee strongly suppor­ted the removal of the Commonwealth's power to disallow ACT amendments and Northern Territory laws, the committee suggested amendments to the bills and consistent with the recommendations of that report of 4 May the government moved the amendments that have been circulated to the Senate. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The main purpose of the government's amendments are to include a schedule amending the Northern Territory (Self-Government) Act 1978 to remove the Governor-General's power to disallow laws of the Northern Territory Legislative Assem­bly. There is an amendment to exclude Norfolk Island from the operation of the bill. The government amendments to the dis­allowance bill will exclude application of the bill to Norfolk Island. As the committee noted, Norfolk Island's population is on a very different scale to that of the ACT and the Northern Territory. The passage of the Territories Law Reform Act 2010 provides the Commonwealth with increased oversight of Norfolk Island legislation to ensure it is consistent with the national interest. It would therefore be inconsistent for the disallowance bill to apply to Norfolk Island. The amend­ment to the disallowance bill would also remove from clause 4 words that purport to confer 'exclusive legislative authority and responsibility for making laws' on the ACT. As noted by the Senate committee, that is a significant misstatement of the law, apparently, as the Commonwealth's plenary power under section 122 of the Constitution to make laws 'for the government of any territory' will remain unchanged. The government's amendments would change clause 4 to more accurately reflect the current power of the Governor-General to recommend amendments to ACT enactments and Northern Territory laws. Those are the reasons for the government's amendments that we are considering in committee.</span>

                    </a>  We have opposition amendments that are about to be circulated, and I apologise that they have not been circulated already, but I will just foreshadow what they are. The effect of the amendments would be to add the words, at the end of the principal operative provision of the bill, 'if the enactment is inconsistent with a law of the Commonwealth' and to add the further sentence, 'Without limiting the application of this subsection, the Assembly may not enact any law that is inconsistent with the Marriage Act 1961.'</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The purpose of the opposition's committee stage amendments is to do two things. First of all, it corrects an anomaly that would appear in the bill were it to be carried in its current form—that is, as honourable senators should know, under the combined effects of sections 51 and 109 of the Constitution the states may not legislate in areas reserved for the legislative power of the Commonwealth if there is an inconsistency between a Commonwealth law passed under one of the section 51 heads of power and a state law. That inconsistency can arise in one of two principal ways. There may be a direct incon­sistency—for example, if there were to be a Commonwealth law passed under a section 51 head of power which provided to a certain effect and a state law on the same topic which provided to the opposite effect. As honourable senators should know, that is the plainest case of inconsistency under section 109 of the Constitution, and as a result of the operation of that provision the state law would be struck down.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">But very commonly a state law is found to be inconsistent with a Commonwealth law not because of a direct inconsistency but because the Commonwealth law—to use the phrase that the High Court uses—covers the field. So if, for example, the Commonwealth were to pass a law under a section 51 head of power which was intended to be comprehen­sive in relation to that particular topic, then an inconsistent state law, or a state law which sought to regulate the same topic in a manner at variance from the manner in which the Commonwealth law sought to regulate the topic, would also be struck down under section 109 because the Common­wealth law would be considered to cover the field. We in the coalition consider that the Marriage Act is such a law, although I acknowledge that that proposition is contro­versial and that some, including Professor George Williams, have opined that that is not the case, particularly in relation to same-sex marriage.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">If this bill were to be passed in its existing form, without the qualification the opposition seeks to introduce, we would have the unusual situation that the territories would have broader legislative powers than the states because section 109 of the Constitution applies to state laws, not to territory laws. So the device of this amendment is to apply the same test to territory laws as section 109 of the Constitution imposes upon state laws. There is a controversy about the reach of the Marriage Act 1961 and, in particular, the reach of the 2004 amendments to the Marriage Act introduced by the Howard government—with the support at the time of the Labor Party, I might say—which introduced section 88EA into the Marriage Act which prohibited same-sex marriage. The qualifying words of the opposition's amendments, which are really inserted out of abundant caution, are to make it perfectly clear that an inconsistency between a territory law in relation to marriage and the Marriage Act will result in the Marriage Act prevailing. The better view, in my respectful opinion, is, as I said earlier, that the Commonwealth Marriage Act covers the field in relation to marriage, and that is the view of most constitutional lawyers. There is a minority view that it does not. In order to deal with the possibility—argued for, for example, by Professor George Williams—that the Marriage Act does not effectively prohibit same-sex marriage, these additional words are introduced to ensure that no territory law may be inconsistent with any provision of the Marriage Act, including in particular, though it is not set out specifically, section 88EA. That is the reason for the opposition amendments.</span>

                    </a> (<span class="HPS-State">Tasmania</span>—<span class="HPS-MinisterialTitles">Leader of the Australian Greens</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">11:23</span>):  The Greens will not be supporting these amendments. You can see from the process in committee that this is not an eleventh-hour amendment; this is a twelfth-hour amend­ment after a process was put in place that a week's notice be available for private members' time legislation so that parties could get their act into gear. Not only that; it has been known for many months, in fact since last year, that this legislation was coming down the line. Here we have the opposition, through Senator Brandis, bringing in amendments which were not circulated, have not been notified and which are an afterthought. They are so important to the opposition that they are an afterthought in the wake of huge publicity and a committee investigation into this matter!</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Let us look at Senator Brandis's amendments, which have now been circu­lated in the wake of his submission, and see what they do. They run totally contrary to the spirit of the legislation that is before the chamber. Senator Humphries may agree with them, but again they cut down the effort—talk of equal rights here!—to give equal rights to the voters of the territories, as against those of the states, in all matters as far as possible. I have explained that euthan­asia is prohibited by legislation through this parliament, but the matter of marriage is not. What Senator Brandis is arguing is that we should, on the very day we are trying to enhance and make more equal the rights of the voters of the Northern Territory and the Australian Capital Territory, bring in a provision that cuts down those rights in the matter of marriage—because it will be a prohibition that is not there in state law.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The whole thrust of this legislation is to give the territory assemblies, as far as is practicable, the same rights to pass laws for their citizens as the state assemblies have. It is as simple as that. So this is a last-minute effort to pre-empt that principle of democracy. I am surprised that Senator Humphries—and presumably Mr Sezelja, the Leader of the Opposition in the Australian Capital Territory is in very direct commun­ion with Senator Humphries on this matter—wants to cut down the rights of the people of the ACT to deal with marriage laws in ways that are not any different from those of the states. This cuts across the whole principle of the legislation. The Greens will not be supporting it.</span>

                    </a> (<span class="HPS-State">Western Australia</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">11:26</span>):  Senator Bob Brown has just exposed, for all of us to see, what this is all about. The Labor Party caucus has been deceived. The Labor Party caucus agreed to support this legislation on the basis that it would not lead to legalisation of same-sex marriage in the nation's capital. The Labor Party caucus adopted support for this bill—and without controversy, it was reported—because members were assured it was not about same-sex marriage.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">In his contribution just now Senator Brown indicated that the Greens would not support the very sensible amendments that are being put forward by Senator Brandis, amendments which would ensure that the assurances given to Labor Party members and senators would be enshrined in this legislation. Here it is; we can see very well what this is about. The Labor Party has been deceived. Of course we are not surprised that the Greens will not support these amend­ments. But if the Labor Party is true to the assurances that were given to members and senators in the ALP caucus then the Labor Party should support the amendments that will be moved by Senator Brandis on behalf of the coalition.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">At the end of the day, we always knew that this bill was not about improving self-governance arrangements for the ACT or the Northern Territory. This bill is about promoting the cause of same-sex marriage, because Senator Brown knows that the best chance of getting this passed in any jurisdiction is by facilitating it, enabling it to happen, in a territory parliament. We heard: 'No, no, no—this is about improving the democratic rights of territorians. It has nothing to do with same-sex marriage. You want a guarantee that this is not about same-sex marriage? We are going to give it to you.' Katy Gallagher, the ACT Chief Minister, was not prepared to give that guarantee. She declined to comment when she was asked whether the territory would use this bill to pursue same-sex marriage. But Senator Brown has let the cat out of the bag. Senator Brown, in his contribution to the motion foreshadowed by Senator Brandis, has made it very clear what this bill is all about. All this amendment does is enshrine in legislation the guarantees that were given to the Labor Party caucus so that the Labor Party caucus became comfortable to support a Greens initiated bill.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I say again: this is all about the Green tail wagging the Labor Party dog. This all about a Prime Minister who is too weak to stand up to Senator Brown. This is about a Labor Party caucus that is too weak to stand up to the Greens agenda, which many of them do not support. This is all about hanging on to government by the fingernails at any cost. This is a government that is prepared to compromise anything they stand for if it helps them to stay in government.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">If the Labor Party wants to keep any semblance of political integrity in this debate, it will support this amendment because all this amendment does is enshrine in this bill the promise that was made to the Labor Party caucus about what this legislation would do and what it would not do. Labor Party members and senators were told that what it would not do is lead to same-sex marriage in the nation's capital. Senator Brown has just said that he does not want this bill to be amended such that same-sex marriage in the nation's capital would be prevented from going ahead.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">It was the coalition that included the definition of marriage in the Marriage Act 1961 in 2004, the definition being that marriage is the union of a man and a woman to the exclusion of all others voluntarily entered into for life. That is the definition which the Prime Minister tells us publicly she supports, but then she is too weak in the context of this legislation to stand up for the principle she supposedly supports. If the Labor Party is serious about complying with the promise that was made to its members and senators in order to get this bill through its caucus, then the Labor Party will support this very sensible and very important amendment.</span>

He has been smoked out. He said throughout the course of this debate that this was only about giving territorians equal rights.

My amendments gave the Labor Party the opportunity at the last minute to back off and to protect the definition of marriage in the 1961 Marriage Act. By the Labor Party voting with Senator Brown and the Greens to oppose the coalition's amendments, they removed the capacity to protect the definition of marriage in the 1961 Marriage Act applying to the ACT. They have in effect, whether they realise it or not, given their sanction to gay marriage in the ACT.</span>

What we have seen this morning is a stunt from Senator Mathias Cormann and Senator Brandis. If the situation was so serious and of such concern, why did they come into the chamber at the 12th hour, almost literally the 12th hour, and circulate an amendment that no-one had seen? I did not even have a chance to have a copy of it in front of me. I did not even have the amendment in front of me in order to examine what its intent was. We had to rely on Senator Brandis's explanation, such as it was. It was nothing more than a stunt. This legislation is about removing executive power. It is not about gay marriage. It is not about euthanasia.</span>

                    </a> (<span class="HPS-State">Western Australia</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">11:46</span>):  The Labor Party members of this chamber voted against an amendment which would have protected the definition of marriage in the context of this bill, the Australian Capital Territory (Self-Government) Amendment (Disallowance and Amendment Power of the Commonwealth) Bill 2010. The Labor Party voted against it. We are led to believe the only reason that the Labor Party ended up deciding to support this bill is assurances they were given that this would not lead to the legalisation of same-sex marriage in the nation's capital. So here we have it. Senator Bob Brown was so keen to shut up the Labor Party on this that he moved that the motion be put before the minister at the table was able to say anything about it. Not only is this the Green tail wagging the Labor dog; they do not even want this dog to bark. When there was a chance that Minister Sherry was about to jump up to express a view on behalf of the Labor Party on this bill, Senator Brown jumped to his feet and said, 'I move the motion be put.' He did not want Minister Sherry to be in a position where he had to formally say on the record, 'What we said to our Labor members and senators in caucus this week was a lie'. This is very simple. I saw our President, Senator Hogg, walk in, being very, very uncomfortable about what he has been forced to do in this chamber. Our President is a very honourable man, and I can tell you now that President Hogg was very, very uncomfortable about being forced by this Green alliance with Labor members and senators to vote against the definition of marriage through this legislation—as was Senator Furner and as was Senator Stephens. Incidentally, Senator Farrell sat here with a big smile. He does not seem to mind that this could well lead to the legalisation of same-sex marriage in the ACT.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I am mindful of the time, so I will not keep going on this except to say that this is a hypocritical Labor Party. They deceived their caucus. If they were truly committed that this legislation should not lead to the legalisation of same-sex marriage in the territory, they would have supported the very sensible amendment that was moved by Senator Brandis on behalf of the coalition.

For example, I am advised that Woodside has been in contact with the department regarding the clearing of up to 25 hectares of vegetation at James Price Point. I understand departmental officers have reviewed the proposal and have concluded that significant impacts on matters of national environmental significance are unlikely. In its consideration of the proposal, the department took a precautionary approach and that included assuming the greater bilby was present at the site.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">I also understand that the department will be conducting a compliance inspection of James Price Point. That inspection will help to ensure that any activities at the site are meeting the requirements of national environmental law. I understand the compliance inspection will cover works on an access road as well as the clearing of up to 25 hectares for exploratory drilling. I am advised this inspection may be delayed into early next week as I am advised there are reports of a bushfire at the site this week.</span>

                  </a>  I thank the Senate. This is a very important development for Western Australia and a very important development for Australia. The Greens are trying to do everything and anything they can to stop an important LNG project from being developed in the Browse Basin. This is just the latest attempt. It is quite appropriate for the proper processes of state and federal governments to run their course, but this sort of stunt—trying to stop by a decision of the Senate a very important project for the economic development of Australia—is completely out of order. This is not only an important development for Western Austra­lia and for Australia; it is a very important development for the economic opportunities for Indigenous Australians in the north of Western Australia. For the Greens again to try and prevent Indigenous people in Austra­lia from maximising their opportunities in the context of developments like this is just completely outrageous and shows that they are antidevelopment at all costs. They do not believe in proper process. This is a project that should be assessed through the normal state and federal processes as they currently exist, consistent with the legislation.</span>

                  </a>  The point here is that they have not been following proper process. The government decided that this should be assessed as an uncontrolled action. It should never have been decided to assess it as an uncontrolled action. There are bilbies there. We know there are bilbies there—one adult and three babies. We know they are there, and by refusing to issue a stop-work order the government are saying that it is okay to clear the habitat of a national icon endangered species. That is what the govern­ment are saying. They are going ahead and allowing clearing to happen before this project has completed its strategic assess­ment, before the government have made their decision on heritage listing and before this project has had any environmental assess­ment. How is that proper procedure, may I ask? It isn't. It is not proper assessment.</span>

But no, the government of Western Australia and, it appears, the federal government and Wood­side are determined for this project to go on land that has extreme heritage value and high environmental values. This is not carrying out proper process. If the government were concerned about proper process, it would in fact issue a stop-work order, require this area to be assessed and actually assess the information that the community has collected around the existence of bilbies. The govern­ment is saying that it is okay to trash the habitat of another endangered species in this country, and the community is saying that is not acceptable.</span>

The government has allocated $1.6 million annually to support the work it does in Alice Springs, Ntaria, Kintore and Yuen­dumu. Regardless of any future administrat­ive arrangements, it is our objective to secure this annual funding into the future, and Western Desert Dialysis have been assured of this both verbally and in writing. More recently, the government approved funding of $2.3 million to support the delivery of nurse assisted dialysis to Lajamanu and Kalkarindji.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">In addition, the government has allocated $147,000 to the end of May 2013 for Western Desert Dialysis to provide chronic disease management and health promotion. Furthermore, the government recently announced the allocation of $13 million for accommodation in Alice Springs and Tennant Creek to house renal dialysis patients and their families. The government remains committed to working on these issues, although treatment for renal patients is primarily a state and territory responsi­bility. On that basis, we do not support the motion. We think it is not factually correct.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Small">That the Senate take note of the report.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Today I table the report of the Joint Select Committee on Cyber-Safety on the provi­sions of the Cybercrime Legislation Amend­ment Bill 2011. All members of the committee were in agreement, including the Greens, who have complimented the quality of the report. There are some additional comments by the Greens, who would obviously have liked us to go further, but I will leave those matters to Senator Ludlam.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The bill deals with the subject of cybercrime, a subject that has increasingly occupied the attention of all Australian governments and this parliament. The globalisation of communication technology has brought many benefits but it has also enabled transnational crime to flourish. Hacking, the spread of malware, denial of service attacks on private corporations and the institutions of government is the modern face of cybercrime. Large-scale online fraud can net organised crime vast profits. We are no longer dealing the nuisance hacker who gets his kicks from showing off his hacking prowess. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The bill amends the Telecommunications (Intercep­tion and Access) Act, and the Mutual Assistance in Criminal Matters Act, to enable Australia to accede to the Council of Europe Convention on Cybercrime. The convention and the bill are intended to enable law enforcement agencies to keep up with criminal networks that attack computers and computer systems or use the internet to facilitate their criminal enterprise. Before speaking about the report, I would like to outline what the bill does and correct some of the misinformation that is circulating.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">

                    <span style="font-weight:bold;">What the bill does</span>
                  </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">There are four main aspects to the bill. First, it introduces a new mechanism for the preservation of communications to prevent the destruction of potential evidence until a warrant for access is obtained. This new preservation mechanism will be available to law enforcement agencies and to ASIO.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Second, the bill also allows the AFP to apply on behalf of a foreign country for a stored com­munications warrant. So, while the AFP must issue a preservation notice at the request of a foreign country, there is no access to this material without a warrant. The AFP can only apply for the warrant once the Attorney-General has agreed to a formal request for mutual assistance from the foreign country.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Thirdly, the bill allows the AFP to share telecommunications data—that is, non-content data—with a foreign country without the need for a formal mutual assistance request. This may occur only where that data has already been obtained for a domestic investigation. This is intended to speed up international cooperation.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Fourthly, the Ombudsman will have oversight of the preservation regime and stored communications warrants obtained for a foreign country. The Inspector General of Security and Intelligence will have oversight of ASIO's use of the preservation regime for intelligence purposes.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">

                    <span style="font-weight:bold;">What the </span>

                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">It is important to be clear that neither the convention nor the bill seeks to implement a general data retention scheme. It does not, as has been claimed by Crikey this week, 'open the door to mass surveillance of internet usage'. No country can demand the transfer of any data—the content of communication or the 'traffic data'. It simply is not true, as Crikey has claimed, that a country like China will be able to obtain volumes of communi­cations data about dissidents in Australia.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The powers available under the bill, and indeed the powers that already exist under the Telecommunications (Interception and Access) Act, can only be activated where there are legitimate law enforcement require­ments or, in the case of ASIO, legitimate security purposes. Access to the content of communications is provided under warrant and only after a mutual assistance request has been agreed to by the Attorney-General. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The bill makes no change to the range of countries to which police can provide police-to-police assistance. The bill does not allow ASIO to share communications with foreign counterparts.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The committee received 23 submissions and heard from several witness on Monday, 1 August. We also carried out an inspection of the Australian Federal Police high-tech crime operations facilities in Barton. We were conscious of the sensitivity that goes with any expansion of covert police powers, especially powers that involve access to private communications. We are mindful of the importance of subjecting these powers to proper standards and safeguards.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">It is with this in mind that we have proposed a range of realistic, modest and practical changes. If adopted, we believe these changes will go a long way toward allaying any fears of unwarranted intrusions into privacy or unjustified sharing of data with foreign countries.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The time for presentation of this report is short. I will forgo a detailed explanation of each recom­mendation. The general approach of the committee was to ensure that thresh­olds that apply to domestic investigation are equally applied to foreign countries seeking access to communications material.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We have proposed that the AFP guidelines on police-to-police cooperation in possible death penalty scenarios be tightened and should only occur in exceptional circum­stances and with the consent of the relevant ministers. This means that telecommuni­cation data cannot be shared even at an early investigative stage in such matters without the minister's consent.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We also proposed that the general privacy safeguard in proposed clause 180F be elaborated in more detail to provide greater guidance to the AFP. That guidance is already in the explanatory memorandum, but putting it in the statute will provide better visibility to the police and the public.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Finally, the committee proposed that the government consider in more detail what privacy obligations might apply to carriers and carriage service providers. Of course, the Privacy Act already applies. But better visibility and clarity can be achieved if there are clear obligations to destroy material held by a carrier.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Law enforcement agencies already have an obligation to destroy this material when it is no longer relevant to an investigation. The recommendation is that this obligation be replicated for the industry, unless there are other legitimate business purposes for keep­ing the information such as billing.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The intention of the committee is to improve public confidence in the scheme and we are sure that public confidence is equally important to the industry.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">In conclusion, I wish to thank the committee members and the secretariat for their work in this inquiry. I commend the report to the Senate.</span>

                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">
                    <a href="I07" type="MemberSpeech">
                      <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Senator LUDLAM</span>
                    </a> (<span class="HPS-State">Western Australia</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">12:40</span>):  I am very pleased to follow the remarks of Senator Bilyk, the chair of the Joint Select Committee on Cyber-Safety. I will be fairly brief. First of all, I would like to thank the chair, the deputy chair and the rest of the committee for putting together what I think is a very important and very focused report in a very, very short time frame. As usual when bills such as these come through from the Attorney-General's Department, they are always in an inordinate hurry and they are always on fire for the parliament to urgently to dispose of the bills. I thank the efforts of the chair, the deputy chair and the secretariat for getting a coher­ent report into this bill.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I think the chair, Senator Bilyk, has perhaps undersold the efforts of the commit­tee to the extent that the committee majority report made some very strong recommend­ations for changes to the Cybercrime Legislation Amendment Bill 2011. I hope that the Attorney-General does not simply give the report of the cyber-safety committee a once-over and present the bill unamended to the chamber next week. I strongly advise the government against pursuing that course of action and advise it to read the report and to read the unanimous recommendations that the committee put forward because they actually recommend major surgery to this bill both in terms of amendments and in terms of clarifications.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The Senate is used to dealing with instan­ces of expansions of surveillance powers and expansions of law enforcement agencies in Australia. In my experience, it seems we get amendments to the Telecom­munications (Interception and Access) Act every couple of weeks. This is something a little different because this bill does not just relate to Australian security and law enforce­ment agencies; this bill relates to how data is shared with overseas law enforcement agencies, principally of course because the convention relates to Europe. But obviously if Australia is signing on, other countries around the world are signing on as well. This will allow data to be stored not just about serious crimes but about any offence at all.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">If a foreign law enforcement agency wishes to prosecute or pursue an investi­gation, it will now be able to access data stored on Australian servers or in the hands of Australian service providers and that will be able to be used for law enforcement purposes overseas. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Senators may remember the polarised debate on the net filter that occurred over the last couple of years. Everybody who partici­pated in that debate advocated better coord­ination between Australian law enforcement agencies and international agencies, for the obvious reasons—for example, if you are chasing child pornography offences on servers in Eastern Europe or in South-East Asia, or places where it is very difficult for the AFP to execute warrants and so on, you need tighter cooperation to prosecute those offences. I think everybody was unanimous on that. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="&#xD;&#xA;        margin-top:12pt;&#xD;&#xA;      direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The underlying intent of the bill to enable that kind of collaboration in a globally networked media is entirely sound. The problem, as often happens with bills from the Attorney-General's Department, is that there is a colossal overreach; there are all sorts of agendas being advanced behind the cover of the ostensibly sensible objectives of allowing law enforcement agencies to collaborate and to cooperate better. This does not just pertain to acts of terrorism, child pornography or child abuse material being stored on overseas servers, or indeed on Australian servers; this relates to everything—any offence and any form of data that is being stored. Keep in mind of course that there are various kinds of data now that did not even exist 10 years ago. Now, as our lives move online, we leave digital footprints everywhere we go, as do other citizens in highly industrialised count­ries. All this material is now up for grabs. For example, the Attorney-General's Depart­ment floated a bit of a thought bubble, and perhaps the public got onto it a bit sooner than they were intending, about data reten­tion. This is about forcing internet service providers to hold not only material from people suspected of major crimes but also all digital material: records of emails; phone calls; GPS records of your tele­phone—in other words, everywhere you have been; anybody you have communicated with; ever­ything you have done online and every eBay purchase. Why don't we retain all of that in case one of us turns out to be a criminal? That agenda was very strongly rebuffed and we did not hear a great deal about it, but then here it comes again, sneaking in under the cover of an otherwise sensible bill about signing onto this European convention.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Do not forget that these police powers in many European countries occur against the backdrop of very strong human rights protections that do not exist in Australia. The Australian Constitution is silent on human rights. Things like free speech, the protection of privacy and so on are implied rights. In Europe and in North America that is not so; those rights are very firmly stated. In Australia we do not have that safety net.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Having to fast-track this bill, the commit­tee was forced onto a very tight timetable and it forced witnesses, who are largely vol­unteer organisations, to pull together submis­sions at very short notice. To the committee's credit, many of those concerns have been picked up. In this instance, I have chosen to draft and submit additional comments. It is not a dissenting report, but material in addition to the work of the committee. For example, regarding recom­mendation six that deals with the death penalty, we had a very interesting discussion in the committee over a couple of days. How do we feel about the potential for Australian law enforcement agencies sharing informat­ion to aid an over­seas law enforcement agen­cy that would then lead to a prosecution and then an execution? I think there is unanimous opposition in this chamber to the death penalty here in Australia, but if you look at the international instruments that we have signed up to they are also about not enabling judicial murder to occur in other jurisdictions either. We have left the door open for that. Read recommend­ation six—we have enabled that. We have allowed the door to remain open for that information to be transferred and then for people to be executed by their states. I think that is completely unacceptable.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The Ombudsman asked that his powers to inspect and audit compliance with the preservation and data retention regime be clarified to ensure that he can check compli­ance with the act and not mere record keep­ing. That is another very important point. Try to imagine the grey areas that we stumble into when a foreign law enforcement agency comes after a warrant or data retention order for something that is not even a crime in Australia or something of which there is no easy equivalent. Some of the language in the bill regarding those ambiguities is gobbledy­gook and will be extraordinarily difficult to interpret.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">'Traffic data' is not the words that you spoke on the phone or the content of your email but the metadata about who it was sent to, when it was sent, where you might have been at the time that it was sent and so on. Traffic data is quite well defined in the European convention but it is not defined in this bill. It does not use the same termin­ology as the convention and there are going to be really serious mismatches in the inter­pretation of that. A number of witnesses brought that up. It means that we can accede to the convention, but I think we are going to stumble into a swamp of interpretation when citizens or law enforcement officials wish to know what their obligations are under the law. The Privacy Foundation argued along similar lines. Keep in mind that the actual status of the traffic data or metadata that surrounds communications is not about serious and organised crime, terrorism, child prostitution or anything like that; this is about all of the records of all of the moves that we make, and their imprints in cyber­space, now being accessible to foreign law enforcement agencies.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">There are very serious grey areas in this bill. My real plea is that the government read not only the minority report put up by the Greens, which talks about the overreach and goes into some of the specifics that we think should be improved in the bill, but also the majority report that was signed off by all members of the committee this morning. Do not simply serve up the bill unamended just because you imagine that you are always right and that the bill is perfect. This one needs a second thought. Some of these things are probably a bit unusual at the moment—there is not a great deal of this sort of activity occurring—but as we move into the online age, as we move our lives online and as the National Broadband Network rolls out, these things will become routine and we need to get the settings right at the outset. I thank the chamber and I thank the chair, and I look forward to a debate on an amended bill. I seek leave to continue my remarks later.</span>

                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">Under the oversight of the Council of Australian Governments, Australia has made significant progress over the last decade towards an efficient and effective national energy market, in particular in the development of uniform national energy laws for electricity and gas.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">This Bill I am introducing today is part of the current Council of Australian Governments’ reform program under which non-economic regulation of the distribution and retail of gas and electricity will also be subject to the national energy institutions and regulatory arrangements.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">The Australian Energy Market Amendment (National Energy Retail Law) Bill 2011 sees the Commonwealth take an important role in implementing the cooperative legislative regime for regulating retailers and distributors who sell and supply electricity and gas to retail customers.  It is the final major component of the national energy market reform program agreed by the Council of Australian Governments in response to their 2002 Energy Market Review, ‘Towards a Truly National and Efficient Energy Market’ and set out in the Australian Energy Market Agreement.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">The South Australian Parliament passed the National Energy Retail Law (South Australia) Bill 2010 (SA) on 9 March 2011.  That Bill received Royal Assent on 17 March 2011.  The National Energy Retail Law (South Australia) Act 2011 (SA) includes as its Schedule the National Energy Retail Law, which provides for rules and regulations to be made under that Law, called the National Energy Retail Rules and the National Energy Retail Regulations.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">The National Energy Retail Law set out in the Schedule to the National Energy Retail Law (South Australia) Act 2011 (SA), and the Rules and Regulations to be made under it, are supported by amendments to the National Electricity Law and the National Gas Law included in the Statutes Amendment (National Energy Retail Law) Act 2011 (SA).</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">The South Australian Minister will also make rules which amend the National Electricity Rules and the National Gas Rules on two related matters.  The first set of amendments are national rules which enable retail customers and property developers to seek new (or significant modifi­cations to existing) connections to electricity and gas distribution networks.  The second set of amendments are new rules to set out the rights and obligations between distributors and retailers which are necessary to support the retail supply of energy to customers and include a credit support regime.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">Together the National Energy Retail Law set out in the Schedule to the National Energy Retail Law (South Australia) Act 2011 (SA), the Rules and Regulations made under it and the consequential amendments to the national electricity and national gas regimes are known as the National Energy Customer Framework (the Customer Framework).</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">The Customer Framework will be applied in all jurisdictions which are part of the National Electricity Market, namely South Australia, Victoria, New South Wales, the Australian Capital Territory, Tasmania and Queensland as well as the Commonwealth, by application Acts.  The Ministerial Council on Energy has agreed that jurisdictions will aim for a target uniform commencement date for the Customer Frame­work of 1 July 2012, noting that transitional legislative arrangements will be required to appropriately manage the transition process.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">This Bill will amend the Australian Energy Market Act 2004 (Cth) to apply the National Energy Retail Law set out in the Schedule to the National Energy Retail Law (South Australia) Act 2011 (SA), and the Rules and Regulations made under it, as a law of the Commonwealth in Australia's offshore area (essentially, the area from three nautical miles offshore to the edge of the continental shelf).  This Bill will therefore make the Australian Energy Market Act 2004 (Cth) the Commonwealth's 'application Act' for the new national energy retail regime.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">The National Energy Retail Law will be under the jurisdiction of the Australian Energy Regulator as regulator and enforcement body and the Australian Energy Market Commission as rule maker.  Its primary aims are to streamline regula­tory requirements, increase efficiency through regulatory harmonisation and maintain best practice consumer protection.  As a result, the National Energy Retail Law is expected to facilitate an increase in retail competition by reducing regulatory complexity and lowering barriers to entry, as well as by encouraging consumers to participate in this competitive market by providing strong and equitable consu­mer protections across participating jurisdictions.  Other key benefits of the National Energy Retail Law include an increase in efficiency and competition obtained through having national regulatory arrangements, a comprehensive suite of robust energy-specific consumer protections, and the establishment of a national Retailer of Last Resort framework.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">The National Energy Retail Law incorporates an objective which mirrors the objectives in the National Electricity Law and the National Gas Law.  The national energy retail objective is "to promote efficient investment in, and efficient operation and use of, energy services for the long term interests of consumers of energy with respect to price, quality, safety, reliability and security of supply of energy."  The alignment between the objectives of the laws governing the various sectors of the energy markets is an important foundation for the regime.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">Currently each jurisdictional regime has a different regulator that makes decisions and determinations for that jurisdiction.  Under the new National Energy Retail Law, the regulation of all energy retail businesses will be undertaken by a single national regulator, the Australian Energy Regulator - a Commonwealth body.  This Bill provides for the extension of the Australian Energy Regulator’s powers to regulate the retail energy market.  The National Energy Retail Law therefore brings the whole energy supply chain – wholesale markets, transmission networks, distribution networks and now retail markets – under national regulation with the Australian Energy Regulator overseeing a robust compliance and enforcement regime across all participating jurisdictions.  This crucial reform will lead to a more efficient and consistent regulatory decision-making process.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">Under the National Energy Retail Law, the Australian Energy Regulator will exercise a range of regulatory functions and powers.  These functions include administering a targeted compliance monitoring and enforcement regime.  The enforcement regime in the National Energy Retail Law reflects and enhances the current enforcement regimes in the National Electricity Law and the National Gas Law to create a harmonised enforcement regime across the national legislative frameworks.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">The National Energy Retail Law will give the Australian Energy Regulator a range of new functions and powers, suitable for the regulation of the energy retail regime.  These include the power to accept enforceable undertakings from energy market participants for the first time.  The national regulator will also have certain new approval functions and undertake performance monitoring and reporting functions specifically targeted to the retail energy market.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">The proposed amendments to Commonwealth legislation provided for in this Bill will ensure that the Commonwealth bodies that are conferred with functions, powers and duties under the National Energy Retail Law (the Australian Energy Regulator and the Australian Competition Tribunal) are able to perform those functions and duties and exercise those powers from the commencement date.  Our role in this Parliament is to facilitate this.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">To this end, this Bill amends the Competition and Consumer Act 2010 (Cth) to explicitly allow the National Energy Retail Law, when applied as a law of a State or Territory, to confer functions and powers, and impose duties on these two Commonwealth bodies.  This includes, in relation to the Australian Energy Regulator, functions, powers or duties conferred or imposed under 'local energy instruments'.  These are subordinate instruments made under a State or Territory law that applies the National Energy Retail Law, the National Electricity Law or the National Gas Law in its own jurisdiction.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">The Bill will also provide that decisions and instruments made by the Australian Energy Regulator for the purposes of the National Energy Retail Law before it commences, such as guidelines made in accordance with the retail consultation procedure set out in the National Energy Retail Rules, will be valid and effective from the commencement of the National Energy Retail Law in this jurisdiction.  The amendment Acts of other jurisdictions will contain similar provisions.  It is important to provide the Australian Energy Regulator with this legislative support, so that it can undertake essential activities necessary for the commencement of the new regulatory regime.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">The involvement of the Australian Energy Regulator and the Australian Competition Tribunal is therefore an essential part of this cooperative scheme, and the Commonwealth must take the lead by legislating to provide for these functions and powers to be exercised.  The South Australian parliament, and indeed parlia­ments in all participating jurisdictions, must see that the Commonwealth is committed to this cooperative scheme.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">The amendments to the Administrative Decisions (Judicial Review) Act 1977 (Cth) contained in this Bill will ensure that decisions made by Commonwealth bodies, such as the Australian Energy Regulator and the Australian Competition Tribunal, under the National Energy Retail Law, when applied as State or Territory law are subject to judicial review by the Federal Court and Federal Magistrates Court.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">In summary, the amendments I am introducing today represent a significant legislative step towards a truly national energy retail regime under a national energy regulator.  This cooperative scheme will ensure that Australia enjoys strong energy customer protections and the benefits of competitive and efficient energy retail markets – both electricity and gas – whilst minimising the regulatory burden on industry.  This Bill has the full support of my State and Territory colleagues on the Ministerial Council on Energy.</span>

                  </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">This Bill is fundamentally about stamping out conspiratorial behaviour by the big banks which isn’t caught by our competition laws.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">These tough new laws have two limbs.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">First, the Bill gives the ACCC the power to take action against any bank which signals its pricing intentions to a competitor for the purpose of substantially lessening competition.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">We’re cracking down on banks who purposefully signal to their competitors that they should all raise their mortgage rates together.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">It’s inherently damaging to consumers for any bank to essentially say to its competitors “don’t worry – if you raise your mortgage rates then I won’t undercut you and take your customers”.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">It allows banks to move their interest rates higher without the full discipline of competition – and at the expense of the consumer.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">This anti-competitive behaviour is an unambiguously bad result for Australian families and small businesses.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">The Bill allows a court to infer the real purpose a bank has in making such a statement — so there is no need for a 'smoking gun'.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">Of course, we are not talking here about ordinary commercial communications.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">Every Australian bank will be able to communicate with its customers, shareholders, market analysts, employees and other stakeholders in the ordinary course of business – just like they have always been able to.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">What we are doing here is cracking down on the insidious practice of signalling between banks which is designed to undermine competition and which inevitably hurts consumers.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">The second limb of the law will prevent banks from discussing their prices with each other behind closed doors, where doing so is not in the ordinary course of business.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">I note that ‘ordinary course of business’ is a wide term, found elsewhere in the Competition and Consumer Act 2010 and in other laws.  For the information of Parliament, it is not necessary that the person or company has engaged in the relevant conduct in the past, or for the conduct to have been regularly or routinely undertaken by that business, or other participants in the industry.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">This prohibition is targeted at those disclosures which are the most clearly anti-competitive and which are most damaging to consumers.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">For example, the ACCC could take action if one bank phones another bank privately to tell them about a planned mortgage interest rate rise.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">Of course, the Bill recognises there will be situations where banks need to discuss pricing with their competitors in a private context.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Small">That’s why we have worked closely with the ACCC since mid-2010 to carefully design these amendments, and have consulted extensively on draft legislation with the industry, legal experts and other stakeholders.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">The Bill introduced in the House in March had a number of specific exceptions, for example in relation to, continuous disclosure obligations, joint ventures, and disclosures to acquirers or suppliers of goods or services.  </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">In the House, the Government moved amendments so that further exceptions are provided that give clear guidance to business about what conduct is, and is not, subject to the prohibitions.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">More specifically, an additional exception will provide banks with certainty that certain disclosures made in the context of corporate workout arrangements will not be subject to the private disclosure of pricing information prohibition. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">The Government recognises that it is important that banks assist financially distressed businesses in avoiding insolvency.  A new, explicit exception will be provided for banks that make certain private disclosures of price related information to a competitor if the purpose of the disclosure is for considering whether or not to take measures to return a borrower to solvency, or to avoid or reduce the risk of the borrower becoming insolvent. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">Also, an exception from the outright prohibition has been provided for in relation to syndicated lending arrangements, which may not otherwise have been exempt from this prohibition through the application of the joint venture exception.  This exception provides lenders surety that they can continue to engage in discussions for the purposes of syndicated loan arrangements.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">In addition, the Government has provided an exception for distribution arrangements related to consumer credit arrangements.  To provide businesses with certainty, this exception draws upon existing, defined terms in the National Consumer Credit Protection Act 2009.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">This means that banks will be able to go ahead and get on with the business of lending provided they aren’t being anti-competitive.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">The Bill contains arrangements for banks to seek immunity where their conduct provides a net public benefit to the community.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">This allows legitimate conduct to occur where it’s not covered by one of the other explicit exemptions - some of which I’ve just mentioned.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">Following consultation with the business community, the Bill now includes a ‘notification’ regime to meet shorter commercial timeframes.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">Where a bank can demonstrate a net public benefit, they can obtain immunity by describing the conduct to the ACCC in a notice. </span>

                  <span class="HPS-Small">The amendments will give greater clarity to the provisions regulating mergers and acquisi­tions.

                  <span class="HPS-Small">The unconscionable conduct amendments are central to the implementation of uniform consumer laws throughout Australia.

                  <span class="HPS-Small">Creeping acquisitions are a series of small-scale acquisitions that, individually, do not substantially lessen competition in a market, but collectively may do so over time.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">Concerns about creeping acquisitions were raised in the context of the ACCC’s report of the inquiry into the competitiveness of retail prices for standard groceries.  In its report, while noting that such acquisitions do not appear to be a significant current concern in the supermarket retail sector, the ACCC expressed its support for the introduction of a general creeping acquisitions law.</span>

                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">Subsequently the Government undertook extensive public consultations in 2008 and 2009 to seek the community’s views on possible reform options.  Through its consultations, the government identified two amendments which would clarify the operation of section 50 as applying in the way it is currently interpreted by the ACCC, as set out in its November 2008 publication, Merger Guidelines.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">The first amendment in the Bill will amend subsections 50(1) and (2) of the Competition and Consumer Act to replace references to ‘a market’ with references to ‘any market’.   This amendment will clarify the ability of the ACCC or a court to consider multiple markets when assessing mergers and acquisitions.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">The amendment will clarify that businesses cannot challenge a decision to block a proposed acquisition on the grounds that the substantial lessening of competition identified was in one or more markets other than the primary market relevant to the merger or acquisition.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">The ACCC and the courts will be able to consider the totality of the competitive effects resulting from an acquisition, including impacts in upstream and downstream markets, not just impacts in ‘a market’.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">The Bill also amends subsection 50(6) of the Competition and Consumer Act.  That subsection has the effect of limiting the scope of section 50 to acquisitions in markets that are ‘substantial’ in a state or territory or region of Australia.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">The amendment to this subsection will provide greater certainty regarding the current practice of the ACCC of considering acquisitions in local markets.  The Merger Guidelines state that the ‘substantiality criterion’ can be satisfied in many ways, including by the number of customers, total sales or the geographical size of the market.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">The Merger Guidelines do not have the force of law.  While the interpretation of the ACCC of subsection 50(6) has not been tested by the courts, it was considered by Justice French in his 2003 decision in the Federal Court in the case of Australian Gas Lighting Company v ACCC.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">While expressing no conclusive view, his Honour left open the possibility that whether a market is considered ‘substantial’ under subsect­ion 50(6) may be determined with reference to Australia as a whole.  If this view were to become established in law through the accumulated weight of legal precedent over time, then it could well preclude acquisitions in geographically confined markets from being considered under section 50.  This would prevent the application of section 50 to local markets where creeping acquisitions have been identified as a concern.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">The Bill deletes the word ‘substantial’ from subsection 50(6).  This removes the risk highlighted by Justice French that a court could in the future adopt the view that acquisitions in geographically confined markets may not be considered substantial and therefore not fall within the scope of section 50.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">The government’s amendment to section 50 will remove that possibility, allowing the ACCC or a court to continue to examine acquisitions in all markets, including in relatively small, local markets.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">Together, these amendments will strengthen the acquisitions provisions of the Competition and Consumer Act under section 50 by clarifying the scope of the law and increasing certainty around its application to markets where creeping acquisitions have been a concern.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">In addition to these amendments, when announcing the way it would respond to concerns about creeping acquisitions, the government also confirmed the power of the ACCC to act in relation to the acquisition of greenfield sites.  </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">The ACCC already considers it has the power to review acquisitions of greenfield sites whether through purchase or lease.  However, if the ACCC is challenged on this in the future, the government has stated it will not hesitate to confirm this power.</span>

                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">The amendments the Bill will make to the unconscionable conduct provisions of the Australian Consumer Law are the product of a recommendation of the Senate Economics Legislation Committee, which inquired into the statutory definition of unconscionable conduct in 2009.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">The Senate Economics Committee recommended that the government set up an inquiry process to determine whether examples or a statement of principles would enhance the unconscionable conduct provisions of the Australian Consumer Law.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">On 5 November 2009, Minister Emerson convened an expert panel to consider the issues raised in the Senate Economics Committee inquiry.  Professor Bryan Horrigan, Mr Ray Steinwall and Mr David Lieberman—all of them experts in competition and consumer law and distinguished in their professional fields—agreed to serve on the panel.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">The government is grateful for the work of the panel—which included many hours on top of their already busy schedules.  In its work, the panel was assisted by officials from the Treasury and the Department of Innovation, Industry, Science and Research.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">The government is also grateful to those who made submissions to both the Senate committee and to the expert panel.  This helped to ensure the range of perspectives that exist in relation to this issue were understood.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">The expert panel found that the unconscion­able conduct provisions have been regularly enforced since their inception, and that the case law is still developing.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">Having said that, the panel also noted that the provisions are not easily understood and could be clearer for businesses, consumers, enforcement agencies and the courts.  However, the panel found that a list of examples of unconscionable conduct would not be helpful.  Indeed, the panel said such a list might give rise to misguided expectations about the scope and application of the law to specific factual scenarios.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">Instead, it recommended the inclusion of some interpretative principles in the unconscionable conduct provisions.  The government has adopted all of the panel’s recommendations concerning unconscionable conduct, including the intro­duction of interpretative principles.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">The first principle will deal with concerns that the practical application of the equitable concept of unconscionable conduct is too narrow when applied to business and consumer relationships.  Courts have tended to stick closely to the traditional equitable concept when applying the statutory prohibitions that were sections 51AB and 51AC of the former Trade Practices Act (now sections 21 and 22 of the Australian Consumer Law) and sections 12CB and 12CC of the ASIC Act.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">For example, the common law required victims of unconscionable conduct to establish that they were at a ‘special disadvantage’ through factors like infirmity, age or a difficulty understanding English, before a court would recognise that unconscionable conduct had occurred.  The present statutory prohibitions on unconscionable conduct sought to remove limitations such as these on the ability of people to seek redress when subjected to unconscionable conduct.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">The Bill amends the law to make it clear that the prohibition is not limited to the equitable or common law doctrines of unconscionable conduct.  The courts should not limit the appli­cation of the provisions by reference to ancient common-law doctrines that are not part of the statute.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">The second interpretative principle will clarify that courts can examine the terms and the manner and extent to which the contract is carried out.  This principle makes it clear that unconscionable conduct is not limited to the bargaining practices leading to the formation of a contract.  </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">Unconscionable conduct can also be apparent in the way in which a party exercises its rights under a contract or in the way in which a party behaves once a contract is made.  It can also apply to the way in which contracts are renewed, renegotiated or terminated.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">This interpretative principle will ensure that any unconscionable conduct—not just that occurring before contracts are made—is subject to the full force of the law.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">The final interpretative principle to be intro­duced by the Bill is that the prohibition on unconscionable conduct applies to systemic conduct or patterns of behaviour and that there is no need to identify a person at a disadvantage in order to attract the prohibition.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">Unconscionable conduct is not limited to individual transactions or events.  A pattern of systematic conduct or patterns of behaviour occurring over a period of time—which might include an accumulation of minor incidents—can also amount to unconscionable conduct.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">This interpretative principle ensures that conduct, rather than individual transactions or events, is the focus of the provisions.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">Further, as the focus is on the conduct rather than the victim, this principle reinforces the point being made in the first interpretative principle that there is no need to identify a person who is at a disadvantage in order to enforce the prohibition.</span>
                </p>

                  <span class="HPS-Small">The Bill will also remove the distinction in the existing provisions between unconscionable conduct that affects businesses and that which affects consumers.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">It combines the existing sections 21 and 22 of the Australian Consumer Law and sections 12CB and 12CC of the ASIC Act, respectively, into one section and rationalises their drafting to apply a single set of specific factors which the court may consider.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">This amendment will eliminate the potential that the concept of unconscionable conduct in the two existing provisions could diverge, through a false assumption that the existence of two provisions signals a distinction in policy.  Any divergence has the potential to lead to confusion, and the distinction should be removed before any such notion develops.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">The amendments will also ensure that a single, cogent body of legal precedent can develop around the statutory concept of unconscionable conduct as it applies to both consumers and businesses. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">The application of the Australian Consumer Law as a law of the Commonwealth and of the states and the territories has many advantages, one of which is that it can be enforced by courts at all levels in a consistent fashion.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">In some states and territories the courts, including lower courts and tribunals, will be applying the prohibition on unconscionable conduct for the first time.  Providing clarity in the interpretation of these provisions will do much to ensure the consistent application of our new, national consumer law across Australia.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Small">I can also inform the chamber that the Ministerial Council for Corporations was consulted in relation to the amendments to the laws in the national corporate regulation scheme, namely the amendments to the ASIC Act, and they have been approved as required under the Corporations Agreement.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Small">The Bill gives effect to a Budget 2011-2012 measure to enable Parenting Payment recipients to access Bereavement Allowance following the death of a partner. Historically, there was no financial advantage in transferring between these payment types. However, the introduction of the Government's Secure and Sustainable Pension Reform package in September 2009 saw a substantial increase to the rate of some pensions, including Bereavement Allowance. Allowing a Parenting Payment recipient to transfer to Bereavement Allowance for a 14-week period, on the death of their partner, will provide additional financial assistance during a difficult time.</span>

                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">The Bill also gives effect to another Budget 2011-2012 measure, to more closely align the rules for accessing Special Benefit for Provisional Partner Visa holders with the rules for other newly arrived migrants.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">From 1 January 2012, a class of visa holders determined by legislative instrument will be required to wait two years to be eligible for Special Benefit. This rule will not apply if the visa holder is able to demonstrate that there has been a substantial change in their circumstances after their arrival in Australia and they are in hardship.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">Under current policy, Provisional Partner Visa holders are able to access Special Benefit from when they are granted the visa and are in Australia if they can demonstrate they are suffering from 'financial hardship'. </span>

                  <span class="HPS-Small">This is not consistent with other newly arrived migrants subject to the Newly Arrived Residence Waiting Period, who need to demonstrate both 'financial hardship' and 'change in circumstance outside of their control' in order to access Special Benefit. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">Under these changes from 1 January 2012, Provisional Partner Visa Holders will need to demonstrate they have experienced a 'substantial change of circumstances beyond their control' in addition to financial hardship in order to access Special Benefit. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">These changes reflect the community's expectation that new migrants to Australia should be able to support themselves, or be supported by their families and partners unless they are impacted by circumstances outside of their control.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">The new arrangements continue however, to ensure adequate protection for vulnerable migrants on Provisional Partner Visas, for example where there is domestic violence, death of a partner or an injury or accident after their arrival in Australia. </span>

                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">The Bill also makes changes to the social security law and veterans' entitlements legislation to enhance the integrity of certain asset-test exempt income streams. These amendments strengthen the existing rules that require lifetime and life expectancy income streams to provide an annual actuarial certificate, in order to gain the benefit of concessional treatment under the social security law. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">Currently, in order for holders of lifetime and life expectancy income streams to benefit from concessional treatment under the social security assets test and the Veterans' Entitlements Act, it is required that an actuary certifies that there is a high probability that the provider of the income stream will be able to pay the income stream for its full term. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">Currently, some social security customers, after submitting an actuarial certificate that fails to meet the high probability test, later seek to replace this initial certificate with a more favourable certificate that meets the high probability test, a number of times within a financial year. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">This Bill clarifies that customers can only give the Secretary (or the Repatriation Commission) one actuarial certificate for each financial year to show that the fund has sufficient resources to pay an income stream for its term.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">In the event that a person submits more than one certificate for a particular financial year, only the first certificate given will have effect, not any of the subsequent certificates. </span>

This ensures that, in calculating income maintenance periods under the Act, people who receive these payments are treated the same as people who receive other types of redundancy payments.<span style="&#xD;&#xA;          background-color:;&#xD;&#xA;        &#xD;&#xA;    background:yellow;&#xD;&#xA;  "></span></span>

                  <span class="HPS-Small">This amendment is important for families with disabled children in regional Australia.  The Better Start for Children with Disability initiative provides funding for early treatment of disabled children.  This is important because treating disabled children early in their lives is shown to be more effective than later treatment.  Children with disabilities such as sight and hearing impairments, cerebral palsy, Down syndrome or Fragile X syndrome will now have a better start to life under this initiative. </span>

                  <span class="HPS-Small">The outer regional and remote payments, made under the Better Start for Children with Disability initiative, are payments of $2,000 available to families in rural Australia.

                  <span class="HPS-Small">Schedule 3 primarily adds two new organisations to the 1997 Income Tax Assessment Act, namely, the New Zealand Government’s Christchurch Earthquake Appeal and the Cancer Australia Gift Fund.  The New Zealand Government established the Christchurch Earthquake Appeal to help the communities, families and people of Christchurch and the Canterbury region in the wake of the devastating earthquake which hit Christchurch on 22 February 2011.

                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">This Bill amends the Offshore Petroleum and Greenhouse Gas Storage Act 2006 (the OPGGS Act) to establish a national offshore regulator of safety, integrity and environmental management of petroleum and greenhouse gas storage activities in Commonwealth waters.  A national offshore titles administrator will also be established through amendments in this Bill to administer titles in Commonwealth waters.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">This is the principal Bill in a package of complementary amendment bills, which I will be introducing in this session.  This Bill will largely implement the Government’s response to the 2009 Productivity Commission’s Review of Regulatory Burden on Upstream Petroleum (Oil and Gas) Sector.  The Productivity Commission’s principal recommendation to reduce unnecessary burden on the industry was the establishment of a national offshore petroleum regulator.  </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">The Report of the Montara Commission of Inquiry of June 2010 recommended, amongst other things, that the proposal to establish a national offshore petroleum regulator should be pursued at a minimum.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">The Montara Commission specifically recommended the establishment of a single, independent regulatory body looking after safety as a primary objective in addition to well integrity and environmental management. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">The 2008 Varanus Island pipeline explosion and the 2009 Montara oil and gas blowout highlighted the need for improvement in the regulatory regime to be robust and seamless.  The existing regulatory arrangements are complex, disjointed, and involve inconsistent admin­istration, including regulatory duplication across governments.  These inadequacies largely stem from the risk of regulatory gaps arising from the regulation of safety and integrity being separate from the regulation of environment and day-to-day operations.  Maintaining the current arrange­ments is not a credible option in light of the Productivity Commission Review and the Report of the Montara Commission of Inquiry. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">In 2009, the Productivity Commission identified a significant unnecessary regulatory burden on the industry.  The system is burdensome, slow and lacks consistency across jurisdictions.  Currently, the Commonwealth Government has responsibility for petroleum operations in Australia’s offshore areas beyond three nautical miles; however the day-to-day regulation is undertaken by the Designated Authority (DA) in each state and the Northern Territory.  This system requires seven separate Designated Authority regulators for Common­wealth waters around Australia, resulting in an inefficient approach to regulation.  With the reforms contained in this package of legislative amendments the Government is replacing the seven Designated Authorities with an integrated regulatory system, promoting consistency and efficiency across Commonwealth waters.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">The administration of titles will be centralised in the new National Offshore Petroleum Titles Administrator (NOPTA), which will replace the Designated Authority system currently in place for Commonwealth waters.  However, the Joint Authority, which comprises the Commonwealth Minister and the relevant state or Northern Territory (NT) Minister, will be retained as the decision maker for key petroleum title decisions. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">Retaining the Joint Authorities for petroleum titles ensures that each state and the Northern Territory continues to have a role in decision making on key petroleum projects in Commonwealth waters that could impact the individual state or territory.  NOPTA will make recommendations to the Joint Authorities on key title decisions as well as administer titles and collect data relating to petroleum and greenhouse gas storage activities in Commonwealth waters.  </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">As is currently the case, the responsible Commonwealth Minister’s view would prevail in the event of a disagreement.  The Commonwealth Minister will also remain the decision maker for greenhouse gas storage titles.  States and the Northern Territory will have an option to confer their administrative powers in their coastal waters on NOPTA.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">The existing National Offshore Petroleum Safety Authority’s (NOPSA) functions are to be increased to complement their expanded responsibility for well-integrity regulation which this Parliament passed last year.  A single national offshore petroleum regulator will ensure only one agency regulates the safety of Australia’s offshore petroleum workers and the environment, from exploration through to decommissioning.  Safety, environment protec­tion and day to day operational consents are all concerned with integrity and it is essential that they be regulated in an integrated manner.  The expanded authority will be known as the National Offshore Petroleum Safety and Environmental Management Authority (NOPSEMA).</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">In developing these reforms, the Australian Government has undertaken significant stake­holder consultation over the last 15 months, with states and the Northern Territory, as well as with NOPSA and the industry.  As with NOPSA currently, both NOPTA and NOPSEMA will be based in Perth, convenient for the oil and gas industry, and will operate on a full cost recovery basis.  This approach is consistent with the Australian Government’s policy on cost recovery and will help ensure minimal cost regulatory and burden to industry. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">These cost recovery arrangements will be reviewed regularly, in consultation with the industry.  The establishment costs of NOPTA and NOPSEMA will also be cost recovered, through the existing registration fees, paid by the industry on transfers and dealings of offshore titles.  Once the establishment costs of NOPSEMA and NOPTA are fully recovered, currently expected in 2013, these fees will be scrapped – representing a significant cost saving for the industry.  </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">Additionally, these reforms also deliver on the Government’s commitment to the Council of Australian Governments (COAG) reform priorities.  COAG’s National Partnership Agreement to Deliver a Seamless National Economy includes milestones to implement the agreed Productivity Commission recommend­ations and remove unnecessary burdens on industry.  </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">The offshore oil and gas industry is vital to sustaining our country’s economic prosperity and security.  By passing this bill, together with the other complementary bills, will help deliver on the Government’s commitment to ensuring the Australian community’s confidence in the regulation of the offshore petroleum industry by ensuring operating standards are the best and safest in the world. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">The reforms put forward through these Bills will help streamline Australia’s regulatory system, ensuring Australia’s continuing competitive advantage for the necessary investment in Australia’s offshore oil and gas industry to develop our resources for all Australians.</span>
                </p>

                  <span class="HPS-Small">This Bill is to make consequential amendments to the Offshore Petroleum (Royalty) Act 2006 (the Royalty Act).  </span>

                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">The amendments are a result of the Offshore Petroleum and Greenhouse Gas Storage Amendment (National Regulator) Bill 2011, which establishes a National Offshore Petroleum Titles Administrator (NOPTA) and the National Offshore Petroleum Safety and Environmental Management Authority (NOPSEMA).  NOPTA will advise the Joint Authorities on key petroleum title decisions and administer titles and collect and release data.  NOPTA will replace the seven Designated Authorities as the administrator of day-to-day petroleum activities in Commonwealth waters.  </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">To reflect this reform, this bill amends the Royalty Act to replace references to the Designated Authority with the Titles Administrator.  The Bill has no impact on the level of royalties paid by industry or on the sharing of those royalties with Western Australia.</span>

                    </a> (<span class="HPS-State">Northern Territory</span>—<span class="HPS-MinisterialTitles">Deputy Leader of The Nationals</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">12:56</span>):  I rise today to make a contribution to the debate on the Indigenous Education (Targeted Assistance) Amendment Bill 2011. This is non-controversial legislation in the sense that we support the bill. The bill fundamentally deals with two programs: one is the Sporting Chance Program and the other is the Indigenous Youth Mobility Program. These programs have done a very good job in reconnecting Aboriginal people with their schools and their sport. They have certainly increased not only their partici­pation but their success rates in their chosen endeavours. Like many issues in this area, the sad thing is that the bill provides only a further 12 months of funding.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The reason we support these two programs is that fundamentally they are legacy programs from the previous govern­ment, and I commend the government for recognising and maintaining those. But the budget is only for an extra 12 months, which beggars belief when this is such good work. Of course, work comes from people. Policy does not just roll out of a machine and these programs end up getting run. You have to make an investment in staff to run these programs. And of course those staff, again, are not machines. They have mortgages; they have to have some security of tenure. We have now been issued another 12 months—well, jolly good. Times are pretty tough out there and it is very important that the individuals who are part of these programs, particularly the staff of the Sporting Chance and the Indigenous Youth Mobility pro­grams, have a much longer tenure than the 12 months that have been indicated here.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This appears to be symptomatic. Just last week I was speaking to some individuals who run a dialysis service in the Western Desert. They have eight dialysis machines without which those in the Western Desert with renal failure simply could not cope. They have a funding extension of six months.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I am not quite sure why the government is taking this course, but it is taking away people's security in thinking: 'I can stay in this job. It is a career. It's not just a casual job where I have six months tenure.' In areas like dialysis and working with young people we need the people who are delivering these very important programs to know that they have a sustainable future in those programs. Sadly, whilst we support the bill, this is just another example of the lack of recognition of that issue.</span>

We believe that the passage of this bill will provide important support for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander students. I would ask Senator Scullion to refer to the explanatory memorandum, which explains quite clearly that the government's intention is to align these programs with the review of school funding that is occurring. There is no deliberate attempt to provide difficulty with the tenure of these programs and I am sure Senator Scullion is aware that we are conducting a comprehensive review of school funding initiatives. I also cannot help but note that he comes from the coalition that supported Work Choices, which had perhaps the most profound impacts on employment tenure.</span>

                    </a>  For the record, the minister has indicated that this is all part of a review. We know that the government is very focused on significant outcomes like declaring reviews, but by the government's own admission it would know that this review is focused on all of the mainstream programs. By its own admission, it has said there may be some implications. So, to stand in this place and say, 'This is a review; it's all part of the process,' and to bang on hopelessly about Work Choices reminds me of those people who desperately reach for the Work Choices lever. This is the panic button of politics. 'Some implications' is no excuse not to provide longer term funding and future planning for successful programs. That is what we need and that is not what the government has provided.</span>

                    </a> (<span class="HPS-State">Western Australia</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">13:02</span>):  The purpose of the Statute Stocktake Bill (No.1) 2011 is to repeal 39 redundant special appropriations relating to the Commonwealth's financial framework. This includes the repeal of one statutory special account and 25 redundant acts in their entirety. This is a housekeeping bill and has no material consequence in relation to the provision of government programs, funding or new policy. It is part of an ongoing bipartisan commitment to clean up the statute book and it has occurred through five previous financial framework legislation amendment acts between 2005 and 2010, as well as the Statute Stocktake (Regulatory and Other Laws) Act 2009.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Examples of the types of redundant legislation that this bill seeks to repeal include the Papua New Guinea Loan (International Bank) Act 1974, which related to the Commonwealth's guarantee of a loan that PNG took out with the International Bank for Reconstruction and Development and which has since been repaid. It also includes the State Grants (Special Assistance to South Australia) Act 1960, which granted financial assistance to South Australia during the 1959-60 financial year, with the appropriation having long since been spent.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This is a noncontroversial bill. It is a bill the coalition supports. It raises the question though: how many other redundant bills are still on our statute books as we speak today? Hopefully, not only will this work be continued, it also will be accelerated. It is good housekeeping by the parliament.</span>

The bill, if passed, will abolish 39 special appropria­tions, including a statutory special account, by repealing redundant provisions in 11 acts and repealing 25 acts in their entirety. This reflects the government's commitment to enhancing transparency and accountability in the Commonwealth's financial framework, as consistent with the government's response to Operation Sunlight.</span>

                    </a> (<span class="HPS-State">South Australia</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">13:05</span>):  It is good to be back here again on the Carbon Credits (Carbon Farming Initiative) Bill 2011 and back on this amendment. The debate on this amendment was hopefully drawing to a close before we concluded our time for govern­ment business yesterday. I indicated at that time that the coalition think that this is a very important amendment and we are extremely concerned that the comments of the govern­ment senators suggest that they do not take this amendment as seriously as they should. While it is an amendment being moved by the government, it was an issue championed by the coalition. It was an amendment initially put on the list of amendments by the coalition and we welcome the fact that the government chose to embrace it, that it accepted there are genuine stakeholders interested in this amendment. The farming community and the National Farmers Federation in particular have been advo­cating for it. But what concerns us is that the government appears to treat the substance of this amendment with disregard. The minister came in here on Tuesday and tabled draft regulations that flow from clause 56 of the bill that this amendment is seeking to add an extra paragraph to. He tabled those regula­tions, which create what is known in the carbon farming bill, colloquially at least, as the 'negative list'—the list of the kinds of projects that are not allowed. And those projects are not allowed for fear of there being adverse consequences as a result of those projects going ahead. There are four different criteria in the existing bill for those adverse consequences as a result of those projects going ahead. Those criteria deal with matters such as access to water, biodiversity considerations, employment considerations and the impact on the local community. And those four criteria are very valid considerations indeed.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We sought, because stakeholders had a concern, to add a fifth criterion—that fifth criterion being this amendment to add the consideration of any adverse impacts on land access for agricultural production. We sought to do that to ensure that there was some certainty of the matter with regard to how this bill would operate and to make sure that it would not see a loss of prime agri­cultural land in Australia from agricultural production. We think that, as a major food producing nation, that is absolutely critical. We think that, as a country that has both an opportunity and a responsibility to grow our food production in the future, that is absolutely critical. And we think that, in terms of the original four criteria for potential adverse consequences, this fifth criterion is equal to if not more important than the other four. So I was concerned when the minister indicated that he could not point to anything in the draft regulations—</span>

We do note that the minister has indicated that he believes the regulations do not require changing to reflect this amendment, do not need anything extra. We do not think that is good enough.

We hope that, as the process of finalising the regulations occurs, the government will ensure that it heeds any calls of stakeholders to make changes based on this new paragraph (e) and ensure that those changes reflect both the spirit and the intent of this new paragraph (e).</span>

As I indicated last time—I think a number of times—in response to the same speech, the amendments are there to both add an additional paragraph to and to clarify the legislation. But, in addition to that, the regulations are out for comment. If there are comments which go to these provisions, and people do want to provide additional material on the basis of those regulations, then comments are always well received and will be considered in due course. But we are talking about amendments at this point, and not the regulations.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Secondly, I want to highlight that we have now been spending three hours or therea­bouts in furious agreement on an amendment that we all agree with. At this rate I would hate to meet an amendment that we do not agree on and see how that affects the time it takes to pass this legislation. The amount of time-wasting by the opposition in relation to the carbon farming initiative bill is now going from the sublime to the ridiculous. We are spending an inordinate amount of time on matters other than the CFI legislation. It is disappointing to see the opposition dragging their heels in relation to a bill such as this. I am not trying to be provocative to those opposite. I am simply pointing out that this bill does need to pass. It is preventing farmers and the community from enjoying the benefits of this bill and being able to access the significant advantages under it.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I understand legislation does take some time to progress in the parliament, and I think I am known as a patient man when it comes to the passage of legislation and the ability to ensure that everyone can have an opportunity to have their particular matters heard. Having sat through yesterday, I am sure most who were in the chamber or watched the chamber would agree that much of it was not about this bill; much of it was not about the amendment that was before us. On that basis, if the opposition are going to continue to take that approach, it will be disappointing to the government that the opposition have gone this far. But I would like a flag as to whether or not the opposition will continue to take this approach for the remaining amendments. I do think the opposition does need the required time to be able to consider each individual amendment in a thoughtful and considered way—I do not quibble with that. However, I do want to flag that at some point we will need to finalise this bill. If the opposition can point to additional time or hours we might be able to consider, that would be helpful, because we do not want to be sitting here at Christmas time still on the carbon farming initiative bill—and at the rate we are going we could very well be.</span>

                    </a> (<span class="HPS-State">South Australia</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">13:14</span>):  I was not intending to speak again on government amendment (1), but Minister Ludwig did invite my contribution, so I will make one. Let me be very clear. Some days this place proceeds through things faster than other days, some days the focus is very specific to the detail of the question before the chair and some days—due to issues and events of the day—debate is a bit more wide ranging. That occurs on all sides, from all parties and at all times, and it is well accepted and tolerated right around the chamber. We have no particular desire to delay the debate on this measure. Each time it has come up, we have come in here and made constructive contributions. The opposition seeks to work through each of these amendments system­atically as best as we possibly can.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We will happily work with you. I will leave it to Senator Ludwig, who is not only the minister at the table but also the Manager of Government Business in the Senate, to negotiate with his equivalents from the other parties in this place as to hours and how this legislation is treated—that is, when we debate it. However, how we debate it and how long we debate it will of course be determined, ultimately, by the chamber. We will seek to move through as systematically and cooperatively as we can whilst giving everything appropriate airing.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I say to the government that when we went through the Senate committee process on this bill there was a lot of criticism about the way the drafting occurred and about the way consultation and engagement with stakeholders occurred. There was a lot of criticism of the time line. As we then finalised that, there was a lot of criticism that the substantial draft regulations underpinning how this bill works—in particular, the negative list to which this amendment pertains—had not been finalised and were not publicly available to be considered in tandem with this legislation. If anything has slowed down the debate this week, it is the reality that it was only on Tuesday that the government came into this place and presented those draft regulations, for which the opposition and many others had been calling for some time. That is what slowed down debate this week.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Yes, some questions and some contribu­tions have gone more to the draft regulations than to the specific amendments we are considering. That is because we have been consistent from day one that those regula­tions are critically important to the way this bill works and that they should have been considered in tandem with this bill. That point has been made by many coalition speakers and was made in the dissenting report of the committee inquiry into this bill and, in fact, when this bill was first released.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">So we have been crystal clear. We are pleased to finally see those draft regulations. They do of course aid us in the debate. But if those draft regulations had been released back when they should have been released—so that the full measure of the complexity and the impact of this legislation could have been considered as one—then the debate to date might well have proceeded far more smoothly. But, as I said, I think we have given extensive consideration to this amendment. I note that my colleague Senator Nash, who has a strong interest in this bill, is with us but was not with us yesterday, so I do not know whether or not she is intending to say anything on this amendment. I have said enough on it—I agree with the minister on that—and I trust that we will be able to proceed on the matter shortly.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This is an example of how the clerks always do such a good job in presenting an order for these amendments. It will probably have been useful to have examined some of the other amendments that are proposed by Senator Xenophon and the opposition as we work through some of the factors as to how this scheme interacts with previous schemes in existence, either the Commonwealth's Greenhouse Friendly scheme and the way that it operated or the New South Wales government's GGAS. There have been a number of concerns about the interaction between those programs and ensuring that we have a smooth transition that avoids, as the committee report highlighted, any per­verse outcomes or consequences, especially perverse outcomes or consequences where we may see a pre-existing program that operated as a carbon abatement measure come to an end because it will not be covered or adequately captured by this new Carbon Farming Initiative.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Certainly some of the issues which we will explore in amendments that we will be moving with Senator Xenophon pertain to issues of, in particular, landfill gas. Those issues will look very closely at how we preserve in place such schemes that were developed under Greenhouse Friendly or under the GGAS in New South Wales that capture the off-put from landfill gas and in capturing that off-put—methane, in particu­lar—burn it, generate their own electricity and stop emissions escaping from those landfill sites. There are concerns that, due to the way that this has been structured as legislation, some of those projects will not be able to proceed. They are certainly some of the issues that we plan to address in the joint amendments that have been developed with Senator Xenophon.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">My understanding is that this seeks to provide a more certain period of continuity for those Greenhouse Friendly programs or activities. Greenhouse Friendly was a program initiated by the Howard govern­ment. It was one of many different programs in the climate change space initiated by the Howard government that we are proud to have started, that we are proud to have seen commence and that provide a very sound footing for Australia in meeting our inter­national obligations when it comes to dealing with matters of climate change.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The Howard government set up the first infrastructure in the government to deal with climate change matters, to deal with reducing greenhouse gas emissions and to set Australia on a trajectory where we will proudly be one of the few countries in the world to meet the obligations we agreed to under the Kyoto framework. Greenhouse Friendly has played and will play a key part in making sure that Australia meets those Kyoto framework obligations.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">It is worth noting that Australia will be one of the few countries to do that and has done so without the imposition of a carbon tax. Whilst that debate is one that I know Minister Ludwig does not wish to have at length here, I think it is important when we are highlighting some of these previous programs to note that we have achieved or are well on track to achieving the 2012 commitments set down under that Kyoto framework without such an imposition but through other clever policy measures, including Greenhouse Friendly, which sparked a lot of voluntary action by many parts of the Australian industry who wanted to do their bit, who saw a good opportunity available and who have made great contri­butions towards that target.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Instead, we are now going to enter an era where the government proposes to penalise everybody to try to achieve a target without any international agreement in place beyond 2012. There is a strange contrast between the styles of the two governments. Under the Howard government, we incentivised volun­tary action to meet an agreed global target. Under the Labor government, through penal­ties, they are going to force action to meet a global target that does not exist. That is a very interesting and stark contrast between the approaches of the two governments.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">However, to return to this amendment, we think that in providing continuity, certainty and hopefully making sure that projects that operate under Greenhouse Friendly can continue to operate under this new scheme it is appropriate to give consideration to the amendment that is before the chair.</span>

                    </a> (<span class="HPS-State">Queensland</span>—<span class="HPS-MinisterialTitles">Minister for Agriculture, Fisheries and Forestry, Manager of Government Business in the Senate and Minister Assisting the Attorney-General on Queensland Floods Recovery</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">13:29</span>):  I understand the amend­ment. The government does not support it. This amendment would effectively allow Greenhouse Friendly companies to receive CFI credits for abatement right back to 2008. The CFI does allow some backdating which goes back to 1 July 2010. This is a new piece of legislation designed to assist the farming community. Further backdating to 2008 could literally undermine the environmental integrity and value of the CFI credits. This legislation is designed to ensure that we do have integrity within this system. In looking at this issue though, the government will consider options for including some or all Greenhouse Friendly credits under the National Carbon Offset Standard for a transitional period. So it is not all bad news. This would increase the value of Greenhouse Friendly credits. </span>

                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">In this area, the government's view is that you are in the wrong place. I understand what you are trying to do, but it is about the Carbon Farming Initiative and it is about ensuring that we have a system that allows backdating to 1 July 2010 and that we use the methodologies under this to assist the co-benefits, which I described earlier, in the agricultural areas. But in dealing with Greenhouse Friendly companies, who have those types of things out there, the place to deal with the Greenhouse Friendly credits is under the National Carbon Offset Standard. That legislation is coming before this parlia­ment, so it is not something that we are putting off. A much better opportunity to use that type of action again—in other words, this type of amendment—would be in the guidelines or in the next piece of legislation. That is by way of suggestion. I am trying to gabble with your amendment. We oppose it.</span>

                    </a> (<span class="HPS-State">South Australia</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">13:32</span>):  I thank the minister for his response. He highlighted that there is scope for a backdating, as such, of credits to the start of 1 July 2010, and I note him doing that. The EM states that that is to allow backdating of existing projects such as projects under the Australian government's Greenhouse Friendly program. My under­standing is that for the alternative waste treatment sector the bulk of the Greenhouse Friendly scheme credits they possess were generated during the period between 1 January 2008 and 1 July 2010; thereby meaning that they will, in the main, miss out on that backdating start date of 1 July 2010. Could the minister explain on what basis 1 July 2010 was set as the date and is it the government's understanding that the alternative waste treatment sector will largely miss out as a result of that date having been set?</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This set of amendments ensures that early adopters of carbon sequestration projects will not be disadvantaged under the Carbon Farming Initiative. The collection and use of landfill gas for electricity generation is one of the most effective means of reducing greenhouse gas emissions. Australia's landfill gas power generation sector currently reduces carbon emissions by over four million tonnes of carbon dioxide equivalent each year. However, under the bill currently before the Senate, there is no certainty for these businesses—which currently operate under the New South Wales GGAS scheme or the Greenhouse Friendly scheme—that they will be considered under the prescribed non-CFI offsets scheme, nor what baseline would be applied. These amendments insert a provision that, for existing projects wanting to transition into the CFI scheme, a baseline of 20 per cent be applied to projects currently under the New South Wales GGAS scheme and a baseline of zero per cent be applied to projects currently under the Greenhouse Friendly scheme. These amend­ments also insert the New South Wales GGAS scheme and Greenhouse Friendly scheme into the definition of the prescribed non-CFI offsets scheme. </span>

It should be noted that 20 per cent is a conservative figure that has been determined based on the national greenhouse gas inventory data. Inserting a 20 per cent baseline into the legislation for existing projects under the GGAS scheme and zero per cent for existing projects under the Greenhouse Friendly scheme will give this industry certainty for its projects. </span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">LMS is a renewable electricity generator that was established in 1982. It is a South Australian based company employing some 100 people across the country. It was an early adopter—in fact, one of the first adopters of carbon abatement projects. The Prime Minister visited LMS's Rochedale plant, in Brisbane, on 13 July 2011. This is what the Prime Minister said at that time:</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">And I’m here today at LMS, and I thank them for having me here, looking at how they are generating electricity from landfill. Landfill, as it decomposes, creates the kind of carbon pollution we’re worried about, it particularly creates methane gas. Here at this facility today, instead of that gas simply going into the atmosphere as pollution, it is being captured and it’s being used to generate electricity …</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Small">And that electricity is powering more than 4500 homes. This kind of clean energy future is probably a bit unexpected, people have heard about solar and they’ve heard about wind, they may have heard about geothermal, but here is another innovative way that we will see a clean energy future using the gas from the landfill to generate electricity.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Small">It’s this kind of clean energy future that will be turbo-charged by putting a price on carbon, as we create the circumstances where new clean energy ventures can prosper. I’ve been very pleased to learn about this clean energy venture today and it’s why I’m so determined, because I know these things are possible, that we as a nation seize a clean energy future by putting a price on carbon.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Interestingly, unless we significantly amend the legislation, then the legislation in its current form could well lead to a closure of the very plant that the Prime Minister visited, because there will be no investment certainty. But, more than that, this plant will not be viable. That is a very serious concern. If a standardised baseline of 20 per cent is not provided and does not give certainty to LMS, projects such as the Rochedale project that the Prime Minister visited will, most likely, close down. Indeed, LMS's 15 separate projects under the GGAS scheme could all be threatened if this amendment is not passed. In Queensland, projects include Rochedale, Swanbank, Whitwood Road and Birkdale. New South Wales projects include Tweed Shire; Summer Hill, Newcastle; Awaba, Newcastle; Eastern Creek; and Wyong. In Victoria, LMS has projects in Hallam Road, Wollert, Bendigo, Ballarat and Shepparton. In Tasmania, it has a project in Remount, in Launceston. These projects combined create an estimated 1.33 million tonnes of CO<span style="text-decoration:none underline;">2</span> abatements annually. LMS also has four Greenhouse Friendly projects which could be put at risk. LMS is but one example. </span>

Failure to provide certainty that existing projects will be able to transition into the CFI, with a fixed 20 per cent baseline for GGAS existing projects and zero per cent baseline for existing Green­house Friendly projects, could see the closure of these projects.</span>

I hope Senator Milne does not mind my saying this, but I am particularly grateful for her longstanding interest—long­er standing I think, than that of most of us in this chamber—and her particular awareness of this issue. I know we can debate issues of additionality, but it would not make sense to me unless there is a proper transitional mechanism for these sorts of projects.</span>

Turning it into energy generation is very good for society and greenhouse gas emissions. Whilst we will always aim to reduce landfill, it will be a while before we get to the point where we have zero waste, so we need to support companies that are actually out there doing this. A number of them actually got in and started to do it early before there was any compulsion to do so. However, in recent years, particularly in metro management of waste there have, increasingly, been local and state government regulations requiring the capture of gas from landfill. In terms of this bill, the question then becomes: how can you measure that which is additional, recognising that there is already regulation in metro Australia and that, in most of rural and regional Australia, there is no regulation?</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">However, I am very concerned that the companies concerned had not engaged in this debate in terms of the parliament working out how we might deal with this under the Carbon Farming Initiative. In talking to LMS they said, in particular, that they had been engaged in discussions with the government over a long period and had hoped it would resolve the matter and that is why they had not brought it into a political context. As it has been brought into a political context, I want to thank the minister and the depart­ment for facilitating a meeting for me yesterday with both the company and the technical experts from the department so that we could sit down and work out how we can move this forward. I am sure that no-one in this parliament would want to see companies that are actively engaged in reducing carbon emissions, employing people and doing the right thing actually go broke as a result of this program. No-one in this parliament would think that was a sensible thing.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Yesterday we had a meeting. It came down to a discussion about the technicalities of what the baseline should be for measuring this as the entitlements would occur under the legislation. I have been told that those discussions were fruitful and that there has been some resolution. So, before I make a decision about what we are doing on this matter, I want to hear what actually happen­ed overnight in those technical discussions. It would be good to see this matter resolved in a positive way with regard to the environ­mental impacts, the jobs in those industries and to actually get advancement for this whole issue of management of the land waste sector in Australia.</span>

I also thank Senator Milne for her comments just then and for her indication that this is an area of genuine need for consideration when looking at the bill and, in particular, for reserving her position on these amendments, depending upon where discussions have gone between the government, the affected industry sector and companies and upon what solution the government has for this matter. I will not make a lengthy contri­bution now, noting that the debate will conclude at two o'clock, and I am eager to hear from the minister as to whether there has been some progress. I would just highlight that in the committee report of the inquiry into this the No. 1 recommendation was:</span>

                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">... the government consider options to ensure there are no perverse incentives to cease existing abatement projects, and encourage first movers to undertake further abatement or sequestration activities under the Carbon Farming Initiative.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">In the response to that Senate committee inquiry tabled the other day by the govern­ment, they did indicate support for that recommendation.

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">As Senator Xenophon has highlighted, there are a number of projects that could be at risk were the bill to pass without amend­ment and without addressing this issue. We think that would be totally unacceptable. These are companies that have invested in good faith. These are companies that have done the right thing by the environment by capturing the gases from landfill projects and ensuring that they are used to generate electricity, and it would be an utter waste if those systems were not encouraged into the future. There are many localities—regional centres such as Bendigo, Ballarat, Tweed Shire, Launceston and Newcastle—that would potentially be most vulnerable in this regard. Some of those regional centres would be the ones most likely to see the perverse outcome where, if we pass this, in fact we will end up with less rather than more abate­ment, and that obviously is not an outcome that would be at all acceptable under this scheme.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">There are some other points that I would like to and probably will highlight when we return to this debate but, to make sure that the minister can at least update Senator Milne and the chamber on discussions with proponents to now, I will leave enough time for him.</span>

The government recognises the value of a standardised approach to baseline setting for existing landfill projects that have been operating under GGAS and Greenhouse Friendly. It is something we recognise. The government will consult on appropriate baselines, with a view to having the matters resolved within the next month.

I cannot make any stronger commitment than the words that I have used. They are as strong as we can give.

                    </a> (<span class="HPS-State">South Australia</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">13:56</span>):  I appreciate the minister's answer. I appreciate the minister says that it is not the intention of the government to disadvantage plants such as these, which have made a tremendous contribution in CO<span style="text-decoration:none underline;">2</span> abatement by being early adopters. We know what the Prime Minister has previously said about early adopters generally on the whole issue of greenhouse gases, and I agree with the Prime Minister: if you are an early adopter, you ought to be rewarded. But what we have with this legislation is a situation where early adopters are in fact being punished, to the extent that their businesses might not be viable. To say that this is going to be resolved by regulation is, I believe, completely unsatisfactory. There needs to be a solution to this. It needs to be a solution that is enshrined in legislation rather than left to regulation. If it is left to regulation, it will just compound the uncertainty. We have the whole issue of disallowable instruments, which is quite a proper process, but dealing with this in the absence of a specific legislative framework, a specific legislative baseline, is completely unsatisfactory. </span>

                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">It is important to acknowledge the work of LMS and others who have done this. LMS has previously acknowledged in its material that five per cent is not a realistic baseline. Some of the abatement stems from GGAS projects which could have occurred to control odour and for occupational health and safety reasons. A 10 per cent standard­ised baseline for GGAS landfill gas projects would be realistic, as it would account for common practice legislatively required abatement activities. However, there is a need to be conservative when estimating standardised baselines; therefore, a 20 per cent national baseline for all GGAS landfill gas projects to transition into the CFI is fair and justifiable. It is a conservative approach. It is an appropriate approach. There is no windfall at all. In fact, they are 'taking a haircut', to use a colloquialism, in relation to this. This 20 per cent baseline would only apply to existing GGAS landfill projects. As mentioned previously, GHF projects already have a proven baseline of zero. Any new CFI landfill gas projects should need to satisfy a new standardised baseline. This will ensure the integrity of both the GGAS baseline and the new projects baseline. That is why it is important that the negotiations continue.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I would like to acknowledge again the work of Senator Milne in facilitating that very crucial meeting between the department and LMS, where I think there was some real progress made. Let that progress continue, let it continue quickly and let us ensure that there is a satisfactory outcome, where the outcome can be dealt with in the context of this bill. Do not leave it to chance and uncertainty with regulations. It is simply too important for this early adopter of these measures. </span>

I refer to today's Deloitte's modelling commissioned by the Victorian state government which reveals that in 2015 the carbon tax will cost 23,000 jobs in Victoria. As the Treasury has not modelled the impact of carbon tax on employment in individual states and, in fact, assumes the carbon tax will have no impact on jobs in the long run, how can you dispute these figures?</span>

                  </a>  The extent to which this was a politically motivated exercise is really demonstrated by the fact that the report does not actually include the assistance packages within the government's Clean Energy Future package. It does not actually include the crucial assistance measures that the government has put in place. What an extraordinary proposition: you throw together some modelling, a month after the release of the carbon package, the Clean Energy Future package, to enable you to jump aboard Mr Abbott's scare campaign in order to be able to make false claims ahead of the COAG meeting—all this from a Premier who once supported a price on carbon! It is the case also that not only did the Victorian government fail to include the totality of the assistance measures to support industry and to support jobs in the context of pricing carbon; there is also quite a deliberate attempt to mislead in terms of the outcomes, which was repeated in the senator's question. I look forward to responding to that. <span style="font-style:italic;">(Time expired)</span></span>

The reference to 23,000 jobs is a change from the reference case figure, not an actual change in employment, which is clearly not what the senator put in his question. Mr President, if the senator wants to get into an argument about modelling, I tell you what: I would back the Australian Treasury, who used to advise Mr Costello, who is one of the good senator's great heroes, in relation to the budget, in relation to the budget forecasts and in relation to the <span style="font-style:italic;">Intergenerational report</span>, all of which show employment continues to grow under a carbon price—</span>

That is why so many nations of the world are putting so much investment into clean energy, into generating energy more efficiently and more cleanly and into industrial and other processes becoming more energy efficient. The reality is the world is increasingly paying a higher premium for low-carbon goods and services, for clean-energy goods and services, and we on this side want to make sure Australians are positioned to take advantage of those opportunities. The difference is those on this side are prepared to look to the future and those on that side simply want to run a scare campaign today.</span>

So this government makes record investments. This government makes a priority of the education and health of Australians. We continue to drive increased investment because we believe the best investment we can make is in education and health, to support our economy, upskill our people and make sure our people are healthy. <span style="font-style:italic;">(Time expired)</span></span>

We saw, by their performance when I was speaking earlier, that they have no interest in education, they have no interest in health. They only have interest in negative political point-scoring. They only have interest in opposing. What we do know is that they have plans to slash the investment we are making in schools and in education more broadly and in health. We know they went to the last election promising to cut hundreds of millions of dollars out of funding that would have supported low-income students going to university. They targeted those people's opportunities. We now know that they want to cut $70 billion—$70 billion—from our budget. That would mean, for instance, stopping paying pensioners for two years. That is the size of the cut they are going to impose on Australians. We believe in investing in Australia's future, not slashing opportunities. <span style="font-style:italic;">(Time expired)</span></span>

If you take the opposition leader at his word, what he said at the AMA dinner was that you can judge him by his actions, by his record as health minister. 'That's what I would be like as Prime Minister,' he said. Remember what his record was as minister for health? He cut $1 billion out of funding for public hospitals. He cut $1 billion. So he reinforces the message: you can expect the same sort of negative, budget-slashing approach that he had as health minister. In response to a question back in 2006 about queues for surgery, he said:</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">In relation to health services, the Treasury modelling estimates the average price impact on health services to be around 0.3 per cent. This group in the modelling would include hospital and medical services, optical and dental services and pharmaceuticals. To the extent there is any increase in costs due to the carbon price, current and future funding arrangements will automatically ensure that public hospitals continue to be properly funded. Public hospital funding in the National Healthcare Agreement is indexed at over 7 per cent in each year of the forward estimates. In addition, when we move to the new healthcare agreements the government has struck with the states and territories, the Commonwealth has committed to pay 50 per cent of the growth in hospital costs. I trust this assists the senator.</span>

The character of the Leader of the Opposition is demonstrated by what he did as health minister, which was to cut $1 billion out of Australia's public hospitals. That is the legacy of the Leader of the Opposition and it took a Labor govern­ment to fix it. Those are the facts, Senator. <span style="font-style:italic;">(Time expired)</span></span>

Last night the President of the Australian Medical Association stated that the system of mandatory detention is inher­ently harmful to the physical and mental health of detainees, particularly of children. When will the government recognise that the policy of mandatory detention severely dam­ages those seeking our protection, not just now but for years to come?</span>

I indicate very clearly that the government's position on mandatory detention is that it is an essential aspect of our measures in regard to border control. I would also indicate to the Senate that this is a matter that has enjoyed bipartisan support for some considerable time. The minister has made perfectly clear repeatedly that the government makes no apologies for making sure that unauthorised arrivals do not pose a health risk and that appropriate measures are taken to ensure that identity and security checks can be under­taken so that persons who do arrive in such a manner are not a risk to the community. The government is committed to ensuring that asylum seekers within the immigration detention facilities are housed in humane and appropriate conditions and are provided with appropriate services and care. We ensure that people in detention get health care and support that meets the same standards as in the wider community, care which includes support for mental health measures provided by qualified health professionals.</span>

                  <span style="font-style:italic;" />The government are very open about this matter. We are very accountable for the operations of the immigration detention system. However, we also acknowledge the enormous pressures that are on the network at this time. We have worked very diligently to ensure that there is a change in the culture of detention. We have delivered on it by moving the majority of children in detention into community accommodation. We have undertaken reforms to improve the pro­cessing of asylum seekers' claims. We have ensured the number of irregular maritime arrivals in detention facilities dropped by almost 2,000 since April. The government remain committed, however, to the policy of mandatory detention. <span style="font-style:italic;">(Time expired)</span></span>

How is it that the minister can justify the conflict of interest of these two roles; deciding who will be jailed and who will be protected?</span>

                  </a>  I can indicate to the Senate and repeat what the minister has made very clear, publicly, on many, many occasions. The minister takes his responsi­bilities very seriously in regard to his legal obligation as a guardian of unaccompanied minors, of children in detention centres, who are here without relatives. That remains the case. Senator, I cannot see any evidence that has been presented in any quarter which suggests it would be contrary to the position that the minister has made perfectly clear—repeatedly.</span>

That is a very sub­stantial and important tax reform package which obviously has good participation consequences as well. The Prime Minister has also indicated that nine out of 10 house­holds will receive some assistance through tax cuts or payment increases and almost six million households will get tax cuts or increased payments that cover their entire average price impact. Over four million Australian households will get an extra buffer with assistance that is at least 20 per cent more than the expected average price impact.</span>

I draw your attention to the increasing practice that has been employed. If they want to have a debate, we are happy to have a debate, but question time is for the asking of questions and the answering of them. The practice is not in accordance with the standing orders, not a good development for the operation of question time. I would ask you to have a look at whether it is in order for senators to continually run commentary rather than just ask the supplementary question.</span>

Increases in pensions, increases in the assistance to self-funded retirees, increases to family tax benefit and lifting the tax free threshold—you are clawing it all back. <span style="font-style:italic;">(Time expired)</span></span>

If silence were maintained in this chamber, then there may well be an opportunity for me to hear everything that goes on. But it is very difficult sometimes, and I can assure you I did not hear any comment. If others did, I certainly did not, and whether it was because of the noise that came from either side of this place, I cannot tell you. </span>

You were on your feet, and there were people on your side who were making it very difficult for me to hear you, then there were people who came in from my right who made it equally difficult. You, like any other senator when they are on their feet in this place, are entitled to be heard, and I am going to see that that happens.

The Australian economy is experiencing the biggest structural change in a generation, driven largely by the high dollar. The resources boom is creating a net benefit for our economy; however, it is posing serious challenges for other trade exposed sections of the economy, and firms in those sectors are responding through innovation.</span>

As a country, we have the opportunity to choose the future we want, and we have to be prepared, as a country, to fight for it. We know there are many, many things in this country that are going well for us. In fact, we have a world-class university system. We have a world-class research system. We have well-educated people.

His latest claims are in fact in very, very sharp contrast to the Premier's statements to the Victorian parliament, where he actually supported an emissions trading scheme. It is further evidence of the extraordinary hypocrisy within the Liberal Party on the question of blue-collar jobs, and we all know that that hypocrisy is revealed for anyone who cares to see. That party has only one contribution when it comes to manufacturing workers' jobs—that is, making it easier to sack them. That is what the policy of the Liberal Party is about. We know that the Treasury modelling has predicted that the Victorian economy will grow by 30 per cent by 2020 and by 160 per cent by 2050.

That is something that innovative companies have known for a long time. Companies like global aeronautics giant Boeing have come to parliament today to showcase what Australian research can offer. Boeing has worked with the CSIRO in Australia for more than 22 years on a vast array of projects, ranging from sustainable aviation fuels to fire retardants to aircraft mainten­ance and management to the development of new materials. In May this year the company recognised CSIRO as the supplier of the year in its global awards ceremony. That is an award based on an assessment of 17,500 suppliers to Boeing from around the globe. This is a partnership which is vital for Boeing's ongoing development and invest­ment in this country. Boeing is actually putting people on the payroll as a result of the capacity to cash in on these relationships. <span style="font-style:italic;">(Time expired)</span></span>

I am sure those opposite are aware of that. Agri­cultural industries are beneficiaries under the carbon price. They will be excluded from the carbon price. They will also be able, when the legislation is allowed to pass, to participate in many opportunities to abate carbon. This is an agricultural industry which will be able to partake in co-benefits. Those co-benefits are in reducing salinity and improving the environment while also looking for ways to sequester carbon, to reduce their carbon footprint and also to manage and develop the environment, as they have been doing for many years, and to find an income stream from it.</span>

The oppor­tunities for the agricultural industry, for the forestry industry and for the fisheries industry are there under a carbon price. The agricultural industry will be able to contribute to a clean energy future. They will be able to continue by participating in sequestering carbon, by participating in the benefits that flow from the Clean Energy Future program. There is also $1.7 billion available to assist the industry. In addition, NRMs, natural resource managers, are working right across Australia as we speak today in workshops, going out into agricultural areas to explain the benefits that will come with a price on carbon. <span style="font-style:italic;">(Time expired)</span></span>

Given that from 2014 the govern­ment intends to impose a carbon tax on heavy road transport starting at 6c a litre, exacerbating the huge cost increases that will hit Australian farmers as a result of the carbon tax, can the minister confirm whether the government will abandon the changes to the fuel tax credit scheme, which is just another example of an underhanded attempt to bring agriculture into the carbon tax net?</span>

Like many other industries, there is a lead time for them to develop alternative and more efficient ways of dealing with this. But this government is determined to ensure that we have a clean energy future, that we put a price on carbon, that we do reduce our car­bon emissions. The agricultural industry and a range of industries will benefit signifi­cantly from this package, because what we intend to do when the Senate passes this legislation is create opportunities in both reducing and sequestering carbon.

Overnight, the government has alleged that preventing New Zealand apple imports could result in retaliatory action from New Zealand under the WTO rules. However, could the minister outline which tariffs New Zealand could apply against Australia which are consistent with the Australia New Zealand Closer Economic Agreement, ANZCERTA? Is it not correct that New Zealand could not impose retaliatory tariffs because to do so would be in breach of ANZCERTA because it is not a 'covered agreement' for the purposes of the WTO disputes settlement understanding?</span>

Not agreeing to the WTO rules—the very same rules under which we trade our goods and services over­seas—would expose Australian exporters and Australian trade to retaliatory action from New Zealand. Australia exported some­thing in the order of $8 billion in goods and services to New Zealand in 2010. New Zealand could retaliate against any Austra­lian product and they can raise their tariffs on Australian goods up to 100 per cent. We have an issue which could encompass not only Australian farms but also businesses. New Zealand could choose to target agri­cultural goods—the $110 million of sugar we send to New Zealand, the $10 million of citrus fruit we send to New Zealand, the $90 million of pig-meat we send to New Zealand and the $18 million of beef we send to New Zealand. </span>

Whether people believe that the WTO got it right or wrong, the department has conducted a science based review which is broadly supported by at least three state government biosecurity agencies. Whatever people think of the World Trade Organisation or the merits of the case, there is a bipartisan commitment in this place between the government and the opposition to abide by the international terms— <span style="font-style:italic;">(Time expired)</span></span>

It was Mr John Howard. We have pest and disease incursion arrangements in place to address incursions. That is what we have done. These arrangements place obligations on govern­ment, state and federal—and in certain circumstances on industry themselves—to manage the post-border, the border and the pre-border arrangements.

Can the government confirm that effectively its only contingency plan to contain fire blight when it comes to Australia, not eradicate it, is for farmers to use the antibiotic, streptomycin, which health experts such as Professor Peter Collignon, ANU's professor of infectious diseases, have warned could have serious public health implications?</span>

These arrange­ments place an obligation on governments, state and federal, when these things occur. But, most importantly, it is about preventing its importation, and that is why we have four conditions on this importation of New Zealand apples to manage the risk of a range of diseases, as we do with every other commodity that comes across our border.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">The non-answers given by those on the other side today to what were very, very basic questions from this side in relation to the impact of the carbon tax on the Australian people shows just how scared those on the other side are of the impact of the carbon tax. In fact Minister Wong, when asked directly by Senator Fierravanti-Wells exactly what the impact would be on self-funded retirees and whether or not any self-funded retiree would be worse off, was unable to confirm the comment from her own colleague, Senator Feeney, who said, 'None.' </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">It was put directly to the Minister for Finance and Deregulation whether or not the comment made by Senator Feeney was actually true and the Minister for Finance and Deregulation would not confirm that no self-funded retiree would be worse off under the Labor Party's carbon tax. So every self-funded retiree out there needs to ask themselves: 'Is it me? Am I the self-funded retiree that is going to be left worse off under the Labor Party's carbon tax?' I think Minister Wong was actually very brave to disagree with Senator Feeney, because we all know what happens to those senior members of the Labor Party who disagree with Senator Feeney: they soon find themselves on the political execution hit list. So let us just watch this space very carefully.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I see Senator Farrell sitting there with a wide grin on his face. Senator Farrell, I think your little paws are just as dirty as Senator Feeney's when it comes to the political execution hit list. Remember, the political execution hit list was in relation to Mr Rudd. Mr Rudd was taken out—why? Because the Labor Party's ETS was going to have a devastating impact on the Australian people. It was the wrong policy at the wrong time. Mr Rudd was politically executed by the Labor Party because his policy was the wrong policy at the wrong time.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">It is one thing for the coalition senators to stand here and to properly criticise and scrutinise the government's carbon tax policy but, with headlines like 'Gillard Govern­ment's carbon tax to cost 23,000 jobs in Victoria' in the <span style="font-style:italic;">Herald Sun</span><span style="font-style:italic;">,</span> no wonder the Prime Minister will not take this policy to an election. She knows that if she did those opposite would be on their side and we would be in government. Then, of course, you have New South Wales modelling that shows in New South Wales electricity prices will rise overnight by 15 per cent. Why? Because of the Gillard Labor government's carbon tax policy. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Paul Howes should be very pleased with this statement by BlueScope Steel. They, one of the fiercest critics of the carbon tax, have formally announced a $900 million write-down of their asset values and signalled a review of their domestic steelmaking cap­acity. This is the Paul Howes who publicly said if one job was lost because of the Gillard government's carbon tax policy he would withdraw all support for the carbon tax. Well, Mr Howes, where are you now?</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Again, it is not just the coalition who are actively criticising the impact of this tax on the Australian people. Let us have a look at what New South Wales leader John Robinson told his party and the shadow cabinet. He said that he would never, ever publicly support a carbon tax. Then what happened? He crumbled under the pressure. There was also state Labor MP Bob Harrison. Mr Harrison is someone who would know the impact that this tax would have on jobs, because he was a former steelworker. He has publicly stated:</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Small">How can we believe our prime minister, unfortunately, who promised us there would be no carbon tax before the election and who just managed to scrape in?</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">But it does not end there. What about Mr John Della Bosca? He said:</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">

                  <span style="&#xD;&#xA;    font-size:9.5pt;&#xD;&#xA;  ">... I think the carbon tax is a mistake. It's the craziest thing she [Gillard] could have done ...</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">Tony Sheldon from the Transport Workers Union describes the carbon tax as 'a death tax'. In the seat of Brand, I think that is exactly what Mr Gary Gray thinks of the tax, because the people in the electorate of Brand do not want the carbon tax. I see Senator Bishop smiling, because, Senator Bishop, you know that that is true. The current Prime Minister has failed in the task of national leadership. This week is a shameful week in this place, because it is the one-year anniversary of the greatest lie ever perpetrated on the Australian people. <span style="font-style:italic;">(Time expired)</span></span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-State">Western Australia</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">15:06</span>):  We have just listened to Senator Cash for five minutes. Not once did she go beyond the utterance of cliche or homily—all screeched out there for five minutes without taking a breath and without saying one word of sense. Let us consider a little bit of history. Let us go back in history a little to when the first Howard government was elected in 1996. Since that time, from 1996 until now, there have been three significant packages of legislation introduced into this parliament. Two were introduced by the Howard government and one is about to be introduced by this government. The three packages are the GST legislation, the Work Choices legislation and the government's proposed carbon tax legislation. Each of those packages of legislation goes to one critical factor: it seeks to alter behaviour. In the case of the GST, it sought to alter spending behaviour. In the case of Work Choices, it sought to radically change the use of labour to make it cheaper. In the case of the clean air package, outlined by the government and shortly to be introduced, it goes to changing the behaviour of energy producers and users in this country.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">In the case of the GST, any compensation that was offered by the government of the day had to be dragged out bit by bit. House­holds and families were significantly worse off, as the then government acknowledged, but it had to be done for the good of the country. Of course with the Work Choices legislation it was just about removing protections and benefits. Untold people were harmed, and their retribution was visited in the election of 2007. With the clean air package we acknowledged at the outset that there is going to be some impact on prices. It is going to affect those who are employed, it is going to affect families and it is going to affect those most in need. So what have we done from the outset? We have acknow­ledged that—we have been saying it for 12 months—and we have designed and will implement a comprehensive package of household assistance measures—</span>

They have been out there for the last month or six weeks speaking to pensioner groups, speak­ing to community groups, speaking to those affected, and they have received the same message that every Labor senator across this chamber has, which is that the package of compensation offered by the government to households in need—those earning under $80,000—to self-funded retirees and to pensioners and others in receipt of welfare assistance is much sought after, much appreciated and, when explained in a calm, rational fashion, not only appreciated but desired.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">What does it do? It gives more than adequate compensation to those household units that are going to be affected. As Senator Wong and others said in response to questions during question time, nine out of 10 households in Australia will receive some form of assistance. Almost every household in Australia is going to receive assistance in terms of the implementation of the carbon price package.</span>

The economic interests of the people in those electorates are going to be advanced because this government is going to give some of those six million households—some of those that elect you—assistance that meets or exceeds the expected average price impact.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">But it gets better than that. Over four million households, almost half of all households across Australia, will get assistance that provides a 20 per cent buffer over and above their expected average price impact. In terms of change and the impact it is going to have, you could not ask for a more beneficial approach by a government, across Australia. It is a package of benefits designed to assist and advance the interests of those most in need.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">

                  <a href="G0D" type="MemberSpeech">
                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Senator BERNARDI</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-State">South Australia</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">15:11</span>):  Thank goodness Senator Bishop has run out of time, because the reinvention of history that we heard from him was simply extraordinary. May I take this opportunity to remind Senator Bishop that 12 months ago the Labor Party were not out there talking about the 'clean air' policy—and that is in inverted commas, I say for Hansard's benefit. Twelve months ago the Prime Minister was out there promising there would be no tax on carbon under a govern­ment that she leads. Clearly, the plausible excuse is that she is not leading this govern­ment and it is Senator Bob Brown who is actually leading it. But to all intents and purposes the Prime Minister of Australia is meant to be Julia Gillard, and she made a catastrophic deception of the Australian people a key element of her re-election.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Senator Bishop also, through his historical revisionism, went through key economic reforms and was unable to name one single key economic reform that this Labor govern­ment have actually introduced. They have been in power for nearly four years. In those four years we have seen the Australian economy incur enormous levels of debt. We are now starting to see inflation rise. We are starting to see unemployment rise. We are starting to see a rudderless and directionless government imperil the Australian people. That is why the Australian people are up in arms.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Contrary to Senator Bishop's assertions that the Australian people are saying, 'Yes, we want this economic reform, this clean air tax, this carbon dioxide tax that you are trying to impose upon us,' we know that is not the case. That is why thousands of Australians, the regular mums and dads, the mainstream of Australia—not the extremists captured by the kooky Greens, not the extreme left who want to see the dismantling of industrialisation in this country—pick themselves up and come to Canberra to say, 'We're not happy with the deception of Julia Gillard and the Labor Party.' We know that is the case, and whatever Senator Bishop tries to assert to the contrary in this chamber beggars belief. We know that there are convoys of hundreds, if not thousands, of Australians making their way to Canberra as we speak in a convoy of no-confidence in this government.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">One thing is very clear: partisan politics in this country has taken a break for a while. It is no longer the Liberal Party versus the Labor Party, it is no longer Liberal supporters versus Labor supporters; it is us as Australians against the government. All Australians feel betrayed by this govern­ment. They feel that this government is not serving the national interest. It has taken a dose of that New South Wales disease and it is all about serving Labor's political interests. It is government clinging to government and power at all or any cost.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We have established very clearly that this policy, this erroneously named and misleading carbon tax, is a tax on an odourless and colourless gas called carbon dioxide, which is an essential element for plant food. We know that. It is not a great moral issue of our time, as that deposed former prime minister professed. It is not a key plank of this government's policy because they ditched it under Senator Wong when she was the Minister for Climate Change and Water in the last government and they promised not to introduce it here.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">It is a monumental deception and they are trying to get it through by masquerading it as an environmental measure. I challenge Senator Farrell, who is speaking next, to describe very succinctly exactly what difference this carbon tax is going to make to global temperature or to the environment. They are words that you will never hear uttered. The answer to that—I am not sure Senator Farrell will have the courage to say it—is zero; it is zilch; it is absolutely nothing. It will make no cracker of differ­ence to the temperature or the environment.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The only thing it will affect will be the economy. It will put all Australian industry at a disadvantage. It will put Australian mums, dads, families and pensioners at a disadvantage because the sweetener will come but once. It will come but once and the tax will go on and on and on and it will get bigger and bigger and bigger until a coalition government is elected and this tax is removed. This is the great hoax that this government is putting forward. They say they are going to have a clean air policy, according to Senator Mark Bishop. We have a clean energy revolution going on. It is going to be every bit as fraudulent and every bit as false and every bit as misleading as all their other revolutions. <span style="font-style:italic;">(Time expired)</span></span>

We know it because he is a well-known denier and sceptic on this issue. We know the role that he played in the Liberal Party with his mentor, former Senator Minchin who has now left the parliament, in the removal of Malcolm Turnbull, the former leader of the Liberal Party. We know why Senator Bernardi got involved in that. We know that it was the policy of the former leader Malcolm Turnbull—</span>

We are talking about the policies of the former leader of the Liberal Party Malcolm Turnbull who was very clear on this issue. He was not a sceptic, like yourself. He was not a denier, like yourself. He understood the importance of clean energy and a clean environment.</span>

When he did, Senator Bernardi had the knives out. And we have Senator Cash over there—I am not entirely sure how she voted in that ballot, but I think I can guess.</span>

We kept Australians in jobs and our clean energy future is going to provide lots of young Australians with jobs. I can see Senator McEwen agreeing with me.

                <span class="HPS-Small">That the Senate take note of the answer given by the Minister for Agriculture, Fisheries and Forestry (Senator Ludwig) to a question without notice asked by Senator Xenophon today relating to the importation of apples from New Zealand.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">This is quite a serious matter, particularly given some of the information provided to members and senators this morning in a briefing from Biosecurity Australia. The disturbing element of that is that Australia's apple growers found out yesterday what the final protocols were for the importation of apples from New Zealand. It was only yesterday afternoon, when the minister tabled his statement in this place, that Australia's apple growers found out what the final protocol was for the importation of apples from New Zealand. But it now transpires that there had already been seven permits issued by Biosecurity Australia for the importation of apples from New Zealand into Australia. So, before Australia's apple growers even knew what was going on, this government had issued seven permits to New Zealand growers to import apples into Australia. What I would really like to know is how far ahead of the game the New Zealand growers were. And is it reasonable that New Zealand farmers found out before Australian farmers that there were going to be apples imported into this country? I think it is an absolute disgrace that the minister would tell New Zealand farmers before Australian farmers, and even issue permits for the importation of apples into Australia before Australian farmers knew.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We then find out that those apples will arrive here within days. They will be air-freighted from New Zealand to Australia within days. So Australian apple growers have no opportunity to respond to this. They are left with a fait accompli as the apples will be arriving within days. We then find that the apples were grown and harvested in April this year. That was before even the draft regulations were made public. So what we now have is a situation where apples grown before the draft protocols were made public on 4 May are now being accepted through the process for importation into Australia. So, before we even knew what the initial protocols were, before orchards could be registered, before the final protocols and farm management practices could be verified, this importation was put in place. Apples grown before any of those processes were made public to Australian growers even in a draft form are being qualified for importation into Australia.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I do not know how the industry can have any faith in what the Australian government is doing as part of this process. It is no wonder that there is huge suspicion and huge levels of concern about the efficacy of this process when, before the process was even started, New Zealand farmers were obvious­ly gearing up. We had a hearing into this on 21 July and we were told that officials from the Australian government were going to New Zealand to set up the processes and set up the practices. My view is that they were going there to start the certification process and to begin facilitating the importation of apples from the day that the minister made his final release. How could it be that the New Zealand growers were so prepared before he had even made his final pro­nouncement to the Australian growers that this was going to be the final protocol? That happened yesterday afternoon, and we find this morning that there have been seven permits already issued—there will be apples here within days and they were grown before even the draft protocols were announced to the Australian apple growers. It leads me to believe the fix was in.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The Prime Minister went and addressed the New Zealand parliament in February this year and said, to huge applause in the New Zealand parliament, 'Don't worry, we will abide by the WTO rulings.' Of course, we knew that that would be what the Prime Minister would say. But there was obviously a nudge-nudge, wink-wink and the deal was done. The fix was in in February and New Zealand farmers have been preparing since February to bring apples into this country. And yet our farmers find out yesterday after­noon what the final protocol was. We found out this morning: seven permits issued, the planes are loaded, apples will be here within days—no opportunity for Australian apple growers to deal with this. It is an absolute disgrace.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-State">Western Australia</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">15:28</span>):  The Australian Labor Party does not know how to manage money. Even when the budget was bleeding with red ink back in May the Prime Minister, the Treasurer and the Minister for Finance and Deregulation were walking into television studio after television studio to talk about this surplus that we are going to have in 2012-13. The budget position has deteriorated dramatically since the mid-year economic and fiscal overview in November last year. The deficit, already one of the highest deficits on record, had deteriorated by another $8.5 billion in the couple of months between the mid-year economic and fiscal overview and the budget being delivered in May. The deficit had gone further down by $8½ billion. The deficit worsened by another $10 billion for the 2011-2012 financial year, to take us all the way up to $22.6 billion. So here was this government that wanted everyone to believe that 2012-13 was going to be the year that the Labor Party would finally achieve what they had not achieved since 1989-90, a surplus budget. But we have always been sceptical because this Australian Labor Party spends too much and borrows too much, and, of course, that is why they have to tax too much. This is a government which, in four out of four budgets, has delivered deficits. The last Labor Party surplus in government, here at the federal level, was, as I have mentioned, back in 1989-90.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The reason that this government ends up in this much of a mess is that they just do not know how to live within their means. When the minister for finance was under pressure because of this disastrous fiscal record under the Labor administration, she piped up and said, and this was in the lead-up to the last election, 'Hang on, we have made $83 billion worth of savings.'</span>

                    <span class="HPS-MemberContinuation">Senator CORMANN:</span>
                  </a>  Minister, I am happy to show you the transcript. You said it after the election and the Treasurer, Wayne Swan, said it just before the election and, of course, the Prime Minister has said it at various times as well. So '$83 billion worth of savings'—they were trying to make it look as if they had made some tough decisions. Given that '$83 billion worth of savings', everybody across Australia would think that the government had made some difficult decisions to cut spending. Guess what? Half of the money that was supposed to be in spending cuts was in fact new multibillion-dollar taxes or tax increases. This is a government that thinks that when they rack up a new tax they are actually saving money.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Let us take a step back. In the lead-up to the 2007 election the then Leader of the Opposition, Mr Rudd, said that he was going to be an economic and fiscal conservative; he was going to be a mini John Howard. He was saying to the people of Australia, 'Don't you worry. I am going to look after the public finances. I am going to look after the economy in the same way that John Howard and Peter Costello did.' Then, in the first budget, taxes went up by $20 billion and spending went up by $15 billion. In that first budget, the 2008-09 budget, they still delivered a $27 billion deficit, followed by a $55 billion deficit, followed by a $50 billion deficit—and now we are on track for a $22.6 billion deficit this year. That is if we believe the budget papers, but the budget had a very significant omission.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">When the government knew that they were going to introduce a carbon tax, they delivered a budget without including any information in relation to the carbon tax, a carbon tax which we were promised would not happen, a carbon tax which the govern­ment now says will start on 1 July 2012, a carbon tax which will raise about $25 billion over the forward estimates, a carbon tax which starts on the same day as the mining tax, a carbon tax which Minister Wong said, in media interviews at the time of the budget, would be broadly budget neutral. When we said, 'This budget isn't worth the paper it is written on as the revenue figures are wrong, the expenditure figures are wrong, the growth figures are wrong, the CPI figures are wrong and the jobs figures are wrong,' the minister said, 'Well, the carbon tax is going to be broadly budget neutral, so don't you worry.' Now we know what 'broadly budget neutral' means. We now know that, even after they introduce a multibillion-dollar new tax, even after they introduce a tax which will take $25 billion out of the Australian economy, the government's budget is going to be at least $4.3 billion worse off. But there is more, because Treasury officials admitted during the Senate carbon tax inquiry that the money to buy back the so-called dirty, coal-fired power stations was hidden in the contingency reserve—not over the forward estimates, but beyond the current forward estimates. So here we have a multibillion-dollar new tax which is going to leave our budget worse off over the forward estimates to the tune of $4.3 billion and beyond. And there is more.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The mining tax, according to Treasury modelling, will raise about $38½ billion over the next decade but, true to the form of this wasteful, high-spending, high-taxing, high-debt government, before they have even passed the tax laws through the parliament, before they have even started to collect the tax, they have already spent it. Not only have they already spent it; they have spent more.  So here they are wanting to collect $38.5 billion in mining tax revenue and they have made commitments which are conservatively estimated to cost about $57½ billion over the next decade. On its own the proposal by the government to increase compulsory superannuation to 12 per cent will cost $3.6 billion when it reaches that 12 per cent in 2019-20. That is a figure that was included in the government's own budget papers last year: $3.6 billion it will cost in 2019-20 and, of course, it is increasing from there. According to Treasury, in that same year the mining tax is expected to raise about $3 billion. Incidentally, 65 per cent of that mining tax revenue is to be collected in one single state, Western Australia. So here you have a government that comes in with one new ad hoc multibillion-dollar tax after the other and each one of them is leaving the budget in a worse position. You would think that, when you come in with a tax measure that increases the amount of revenue you collect, the purpose would be to get yourself out of the financial mess that you got yourself into by spending too much. But, no, instead of spending less and instead of taking advantage of all these taxes that they want to bring in to get themselves back into a surplus position, they actually end up in a worse position. In a paper they published in November last year, Treasury said that the budget was going to be in structural deficit until 2019-20. Since then, we have had the carbon tax, which is going to put the budget in a worse position, and we have had the mining tax, which is going to put the budget in a worse position. We also have this dodgy mining tax deal that the government negotiated exclusively and in secret with the three big mining companies, where, under pressure in the lead-up to the election, they promised them, without even having a conversation with state and territory governments about it, that they would credit all state and territory royalties. So now, every time state governments do what they are completely entitled to do under the Constitution—that is, make decisions about their royalty revenues, removing royalty concessions or increasing royalties as they see fit—it will be a hit on the federal budget, courtesy of a dodgy deal negotiated by this government.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The point of the argument here today is that this is a government that, very clearly, is already laying the foundations for preparing the Australian people for the fact that it will not be delivering a surplus budget in 2012-13. The government know that they have a bad track record when it comes to managing money. They know that the Australian people know that they have a bad track record when it comes to managing money. Labor keep talking about surpluses, but it is coalition governments that deliver surplus budgets. Ten out of 11 budgets under the last coalition government were surplus budgets. People across Australia know that after a couple of years of Labor in government it is time to get the coalition back into government to sort out the mess that Labor have created with their complete fiscal recklessness.</span>

                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Senator CAROL BROWN</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-State">Tasmania</span>—<span class="HPS-MinisterialTitles">Deputy Government Whip in the Senate</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">15:38</span>):  I rise to also contribute to the matter of public importance before the Senate today. Contrary to what Senator Cormann would have Australians believe from his contribution—a contribution, I might add, that was full of factually incorrect statements—the Labor govern­ment has a strong track record of proven economic management.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We have delivered strong economic management by shielding Australia from the worst impacts of the global financial crisis. We have been prudent in implementing a cap on new expenditure in our budgets. Our policies are fully costed, with appropriate savings delivered to offset any new expenditure and, despite the difficult economic circumstances we have faced as a nation, we remain on track to bring the budget back into surplus in 2012-13. It is clear we remain committed to fiscal responsibility, which I must say is in stark contrast to what we get from those opposite. Those opposite, led by Mr Abbott and Mr Hockey, have made blunder after blunder in opposition costings, from the black hole in their election commitments to their latest economic debacle, which centres on their $70 billion budget black hole. Mr Abbott and Mr Hockey have been running around announcing policies without maintaining fiscal responsibility, and now they find themselves in a situation where they need to find $70 billion of savings. What will Mr Abbott and Mr Hockey cut? Well might you ask. Where will they deliver their savings? Will they cut age, disability and veteran pensions? Will they cut Medicare? Will they cut education funding? Will they claw back tax cuts? I challenge the Liberals to tell us where these savings are going to come from. It is time for Mr Abbott and Mr Hockey to come clean with the Australian people about what services they plan on cutting.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">While both Mr Abbott and Mr Hockey are looking at cutting services and perhaps pensions, they are split on the size of the black hole, even though Mr Robb seems to be able to count and has indicated on ABC <span style="font-style:italic;">AM</span> that the figure is $70 billion. Mr Hockey says that the coalition need to identify $50 billion, $60 billion, $70 billion of savings that they will make. He is happily going from $50 billion to $70 billion as if we were talking about hundreds of dollars. Then we have Mr Abbott, who refutes that the figure is $70 billion, but we know that it is. We know that Mr Abbott is not interested in economics; he is not interested in balancing the budget. We know that because of the comments that he has made publicly. He continues to have thought bubbles as he roams the country on a massive scare campaign against the government's carbon tax. He is not interested in backing up what he says with any facts or substance.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">So, while those opposite continue to make countless economic blunders, we on this side have had to deal with continuous conjecture and negativity surrounding the Australian economy, which is neither helpful nor accurate, to say the least. Senators in this place are aware of the wild swings in international finance markets. This has no doubt made people anxious about the state of the global economy. As the Treasurer, Mr Swan, rightly pointed out, cautioning against reading too much into short-term movements in the share market:</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Small">Just as a big gain in trading over a day or a couple of days doesn't mean the challenges faced by Europe and the United States have been solved, a big fall doesn't mean they're insurmountable either.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">As the government have highlighted, it will take time for the European and United States economies to get their houses in order. They will have to make tough decisions to reduce their debt and ensure their budgets are sustainable. This will have an impact on the global economic outlook for some time. However, we should remember that in Australia the fundamentals of our economy remains strong in comparison to the rest of the world. Recently, the International Monetary Fund highlighted the fact that in Australia we have very low public debt, low unemployment and a massive pipeline of investment, and we expect to bring the budget back to surplus—although, as the Treasurer has highlighted, this task has been made much tougher by current global events. This government has a strong track record of economic management of the Australian economy. We can also look to our record during the global financial crisis. In a period when advanced economies around the world have been suffering from the largest global recession in over 70 years, the Australian economy has performed remarkably well. This is no coincidence. The strong performance of the Australian economy can be put down to the early decisive action taken by the Labor government. We injected short-term cash stimulus as well as medium- and long-term infrastructure spending to keep the Australian economy in strong shape. What did those opposite want us to do in those times of global financial crisis? They advocated the sit-on-your-hands and the wait-and-see approaches. They wanted to send the Australian economy down the gurgler, essentially abrogating their responsibility to protect and support the Australian economy. But the Labor government's decisive action, stimulus measures and sound fiscal management helped to cushion the Australian economy from the worst impacts of the global recession.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Whilst our economy has remained relatively strong during the GFC, this sum­mer's natural disasters have also impacted on our economy. Recently the full effects of the natural disasters were felt with the release of the national accounts for the March quarter. GDP fell 1.2 per cent in the quarter to be one per cent higher throughout the year. As the Treasurer outlined after the release of the negative GDP result, a period of weak growth was broadly expected after the devastating natural disasters. He said:</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Small">This weakness is likely to be followed by a strong rebound in the June quarter as the economic impacts of the disasters ease and reconstruction picks up.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">However, the Treasurer has outlined that we remain on track to restoring the budget to surplus in 2012-13. Treasury has estimated the floods and cyclones will cost the econ­omy about $12 billion, with lost commodity production likely to be around $9 billion and crop damage more than $2 billion.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The Treasurer has also said that we expect to create another 500,000 jobs in the next couple of years. This is on top of 750,000 jobs we have already created since coming to office in 2007, including 189,000 in the last year alone. Whilst there was a slight increase in July to 5.1 per cent, fundamentally the strength of our labour force participation rate remains strong, especially in comparison to the rest of the world. The unemployment rate is 9.1 per cent in the United States, 7.2 per cent in Canada, 7.7 per cent in the United Kingdom, 9.7 per cent in France and 20.9 per cent in Spain. When we entered the global financial crisis, Australia's unemployment rate was the same as that of the United States. If that were still the case and we had the same unemployment levels as the US, around 9 per cent, then an extra 486,000 Australians would be out of work. Our swift action during the GFC has ensured that Australians have remained in work and that our economy is the envy of the rest of the developed world.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Let us look at some figures. Official interest rates are two full percentage points lower than when the Liberals lost office, currently 4.75 per cent compared to 6.75 per cent in November 2007. Our national government debt is low, currently 7.2 per cent of GDP or 10 times less than the United Kingdom at 75 per cent of GDP and the United states at 72 per cent of GDP. Wages are rising faster— <span style="font-style:italic;">(Time expired)</span></span>

                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Senator JOYCE</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-State">Queensland</span>—<span class="HPS-MinisterialTitles">Leader of The Nationals in the Senate</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">15:48</span>):  Where do you start when you are talking about the Labor Party's track record on economic management? I think there is no better place than with Dr Kenneth Rogoff from Harvard University, who did an analysis of the increase in public sector debt since these luminaries attained government. The country that had the greatest increase in public sector debt was unsurprisingly Iceland. They have basically sunk into the North Atlantic. Ireland was No.2 and No.3 on the list of countries with the greatest proportional increases in public sector debt was Australia. Below us were other countries that we do not like to mention—Greece, Portugal, Spain and the United States. They were all below us on their proportional increase in public sector debt.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">They tell us that they saved us from the recession. I will tell you why we did not go into recession. There are five main reasons. Let us go through them seriatim. There is a red rock called iron ore. We were getting an awful lot of money for it and selling a lot of it. Iron ore was the No.1 reason we did not go into recession. Then there is this black rock from our east coast called coal. We sold a lot that—record amount at a record price. That was the second reason we did not go into recession. Then there were the 31 March shipping figures for wheat. We do not like to talk about agriculture anymore, but the drought ended and record sales of wheat went through. There were two other reasons: a proportionally lower interest rate and a proportionally lower dollar. That is what saved Australia from recession.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Unless Mr Swan can convince the Australian people that buying a flat screen television somehow managed to dig up a tonne of iron ore and put it on a boat, or plant an acre of wheat, or export a tonne of coal, then their argument does not stand. What they did instead was burn down 194 houses with ceiling insulation. Maybe that was a slight stimulus to the building industry. They went on a manic spree of building school halls. I thought that after these school halls were built my daughters would come home speaking French or Latin—Je ne sais pas; pardon monsieur; je ne comprends pas—but they are still speaking the same language I sent them to school with. It did not really stimulate their thinking much; it just gave a whole range of people, such as Reed Constructions, a great ability to rip the Australian people off.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The Labor Party believe in catastrophic climate change, but they do not seem to take into account catastrophic economic change, which is far more predictable. In fact, we were talking about this before the first financial crisis. We had clarion calls from William White of the Bank for International Settlements saying, 'Watch out guys; we are starting to have a few problems with interbank liquidity.' He was saying that prior to the first so-called GFC. We had Dr Paul Woolley talking about financial market dysfunctionality because of the overexten­sion in derivatives. The luminaries of the time, the Tanners and the Swans, were just completely ignoring it. Then it is always a surprise and a wonder when something happens. If you want to understand Mr Swan, it is very simple: half of Wayne Maxwell Swan's life is a promise and the other half of Wayne Maxwell Swan's life is an excuse. You just have to work out which day it is: is it a promise or is it an excuse. It is always one of them.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Let us go through some of his promises. I remember back in the election campaign of 2010 when Mr Speers from Sky was talking to the Prime Minister about what happens if a surplus does not happen. This was what the Prime Minister said: 'Well, failure is not an option here and we won't fail.' The host said: 'But in the event it is not achieved, perhaps it is not achieved, what will you do?' The Prime Minister replied: 'Failure is not an option here. The budget will be in surplus in 2013.' Lately it has been turned into an objective. I wonder how I would say that to my children: 'I was going to feed you tonight—that was a promise, now it's an objective,' or 'I was going to go to work tomorrow—that was a promise, now it's a target as I'm thinking about going to work.' This is the sort of position we have. The Prime Minister, post the 2010 election, said: </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Small">I thank the shadow Treasurer for his question. I agree with him that Australians do deserve a Treasurer with a steady hand, and they have one. They have a Treasurer who has delivered a budget that will return the budget to surplus in 2012-13 exactly as promised.</span>
              </p>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">Promises, promises, promises—don't you love it. And now we have excuses, excuses, excuses.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Now to give the backdown. Last Friday, Julia Gillard, the Prime Minister of Australia said:</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Small">It makes the challenge of bringing the budget back to surplus in 2012-13 more difficult. But it is certainly our objective to return the budget to surplus in 2012-13 and we expect to achieve that.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Mr Swan said:</span>

                <span class="HPS-Small">Well, it's far too early to make any conclusions, but we will be affected—markets are affected, budgets are affected. But we're committed to bringing our budget back to surplus …</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">Now it is a 'commitment'. Even Minister Wong said:</span>

                <span class="HPS-Small">There's really only one set of numbers I'm worried about, and that's making sure we get back into surplus by 2012-13 and that's what this budget will do.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">

                <span class="HPS-Normal">I live in wonder about some guarantees. Remember the war against obesity? What happened to that? Did we win that war? Have we now smote the fat people? Have they gone? No, we lost. We did not seem to win that war. Then the war on Fuelwatch. What happened to that voyeuristic episode? Did we deal with that problem? No, fuel still went up. Then there was the toolbox for the 21st century—remember Kevin Rudd saying, 'This is the toolbox for the 21st century. Every kiddie's got to have one'? What happened to that? Well, they did not get it. They are still waiting. We got half the toolboxes for twice the price. It just goes on and on. The Building the Education Revo­lution was just incredible. The takeover of the hospital system—did we take over the hospital system or is the hospital still winning? Who is winning that fight? Who has taken over the hospital system? And the latest one is: 'She has full confidence in Craig Thomson.' It is incredible. It is quite a mess and it relates exactly to your economic plan.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">They had a temporary extension of their debt. We had a $75 billion gross debt. They always like to talk to you about net debt; they will never talk to you about the actual debt. They have this mystical number which they can never actually tell you how they get to. They can never actually give you the numbers. It is out there like the Yowie or the Abominable Snowman. It is one of those things that is out there but which you can never get a photo of. You can never quite get to it. It is not as definitive as Craig Thoms­on's signature. It is out there but it is going to come back some day.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">What exactly do we have here? They had a temporary increase in their limit from $75 billion to $200 billion because China was going to go into recession. That is what they said. China did not go into recession, but our debt went from a temporary increase of $200 billion to a permanent increase in our overdraft of a quarter of a trillion dollars, because Australia does not want to feel left out. We want to start talking about out debt in portions of a trillion too. It is only fair and reasonable. That is the sort of thing that the Labor Party wants to do to you. They want to be there with the rest of the world. They want to catch up with them on climate change and catch up with them on debt. They want to make sure that we achieve that objective.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">Even in the last speech from Senator Carol Brown she said that it was an issue of no confidence.

Of course it should not be 'no confidence', it should be 'no competence'.</span>

                  </a>  It should have been an issue of no competence. Australia has absolutely no confidence in your competence. That is the issue we are at at the moment. Every time I want to have a bit of a giggle I just go back to projections that you put forward in 2008-09. That was before the North Atlantic global financial crisis. China kept buying our stuff and so did India, so they kept it going on. They predicted that we would have a $21 billion surplus in 2008-09, but we actually ended up with a $27 billion deficit. Then the year after that they predicted a $19.7 billion surplus and we got $57.8 billion—the biggest deficit Australia has ever had in its history. Hooray, we got there, and it only took you a couple of years to do it. Then the year after that there was a $49.4 billion deficit, the second biggest, then a $22.6 billion deficit. They are incredible no matter what they do. They talk about 'return to surplus within the cycle', but the cycle for the Labor Party goes for centuries. It just never stops. The cycle starts getting bad and then it gets worse. Then there is always the promise out there in the sunny plateaus, the sunny outlands, where it will all get better. But now we are left with a resounding success that our finance minister, formerly the minister for climate change—and remember the greatest moral challenge of our time— <span style="font-style:italic;">(Time expired)</span></span>

We have avoided recession, giving us very strong public finances and very low debt; low unemployment at around half the level of the US; a massive pipeline of investment, particularly in resources; strong financial institutions and world-class regulators; and a well-functioning government. Just taking the last comment of 'a well functioning govern­ment', who do we believe: the IMF or Malcolm Turnbull telling SBS that Australia is run by a 'dysfunctional and chaotic government'? I suspect Malcolm is getting confused with the party with whom he sometimes associates himself. Australia's net debt will peak at 7.2 per cent of GDP in 2011-12. If you look around the world, you see the USA with 86 per cent in 2016; Japan, 164 per cent in 2018; the UK, 80 per cent in 2013; Canada, 36 per cent in 2013; France, 82 per cent in 2013; Italy, 101 per cent in 2011; and Germany, 55 per cent in 2012.

When you were last in government you had 11½ very long years, as far as older Australians were concerned, to do something about the aged-care sector, and you did nothing. No, sorry; I correct the record. You did do something. You had six ministers, and each one of them failed the Australian people. Each one of those six ministers failed older Australians, and the people will not forget that. Your track record in terms of reforming the aged-care sector and disabilities is on your head.

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-State">Victoria</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">16:09</span>):  Earlier this week, when I represented the Leader of the Opposition at the state funeral of the former member for Melbourne Ports, Clyde Holding, I had the opportunity to meet two former Labor prime ministers, Paul Keating and Bob Hawke. It is pretty appro­priate to remember that today. We on this side have always been quite generous about some of the things that the Hawke govern­ment did in the late 1980s, particularly around fiscal consolidation. We have been generous about that—a generosity of spirit that I note the Labor Party have never shown. But—their intellectual dishonesty put to one side—meeting those two former Labor prime ministers reminded me just how much of a pale shadow of the Labor Party these people are.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">As opposed to the government that undertook fiscal consolidation after the banana republic comments of the then Treasurer, this is now the party of the inflation genie. After it came to office, we somehow had to tackle a screaming inflation genie that had got out of the bottle. It was the party that before the election said, 'This reckless spending must stop.' If only this government had lived up to those words. It has not. This government has demonstrated in four years that it is utterly incapable of managing this nation's finances.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I will not recount all the figures that have been outlined so effectively by my colleagues Senator Cormann and Senator Joyce. But there is the simple one, the $20 billion surplus that has turned into tens of billions of dollars of endless deficits. There is the myth that the government somehow saved or created some jobs. It is the Keynesian delusion that you can actually create jobs through simply pumping money into the economy, a delusion rooted in how you put the country into recession 20 years ago. You came out of that with the view that, when faced with a downturn, you should, as the Secretary to the Treasury famously said, 'Go early, go hard and go households.' But we know from evidence all around the world, particularly in the United States, as we are seeing now—Senator Polley, you quoted it at such length—that when the government pumps money into an economy it does not create jobs; it simply increases future taxation by driving the budget into deficit. It builds inflationary pressures in the economy because serious structural reform is not achieved by just pumping money into people's hands.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Even more importantly, there has never been an analysis of those alleged 200,000 jobs you saved or created—I get my terminology wrong because the numbers keep changing. There is some analysis around at the moment that shows it works out at nearly half a million dollars a job. How is it worth the taxpayers of Australia paying interest now and having higher taxation than they should in the future in order to save jobs at that cost—it is an assertion that we reject, but just using those numbers shows how ridiculous that claim is—rather than benefiting from what should have been done in order to address the global financial challenges, which was to cut taxes? Because we know now, from evidence all around the world, that when you give people a one-off payment, particularly when it drives a budget into deficit, you do not actually change their behaviour. We know that a lot of that money was used to save or to pay down debt. Some of it was even put into the pokies. But it was not actually used to do what the government claims it was.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Most importantly, this government did that because it wanted to direct the handouts and the projects, and that is the core of the problem: it wants to direct where the money goes. It wants to direct what people do with their money. It does not actually want to give people the choice to invest, to spend their own money as they see fit, absent of government control, because the desire for patronage is at the core of this government. We saw it in other programs it proposed. Does anyone hear of the Ruddbank anymore, a bank that was going to expose Australians to tens of billions of dollars of risk in order to prop up a commercial construction industry? Some might say that the govern­ment was blinkered by being held captive by the CFMEU and the various building unions. Do we hear of the billions of dollars that were poured into the car industry, another highly unionised industry?</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">This is the core of the problem. Labor has always been about patronage. People know, when the government drives the budget into deficit to send them a little cheque, that after it wastes all the other money, that bill is going to come due. That is what drives people's behaviour, particularly when we had the rhetoric saying that the sky was going to fall in on the Australian economy—because this current Treasurer is incapable of taking responsibility, and over there you know it as well as I do, senators on the government side. This Treasurer is incapable of taking responsibility for the government's decisions, because there is always an excuse. At the start it was the inflation genie. You threatened an incredible budget that was going to pull back all the reckless spending. Then, when you did not do that, you had to run around the country scaring the wits out of every household and small business in order to justify your tens of billions of dollars of wasteful spending.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">I want to turn to this myth, this issue they keep talking about, with respect to net debt. When this government counts the net debt, as it appropriately does in the budget, it does so in a table that talks about net financial worth. The $74 billion Future Fund was created and dedicated to fund the liabilities for Commonwealth public sector super­annuation. What the government wants to do is to take that and count it twice. It says, 'Let's look at the gross debt and subtract the Future Fund and a few other things to come up with the net debt figure.' But you are counting it twice because we still have the liability. It is not debt but it is a government liability and a taxpayer liability. You still have the $120-odd billion of superannuation liabilities and you are effectively trying to count the Future Fund twice. The other assets of the Commonwealth are not necessarily able to be liquidated, unless someone is proposing we liquidate the Commonwealth of Australia. You are trying to count the Future Fund twice in order to reduce the figure of the debt you have imposed on future Australians.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">The cost of the debt this financial year is $12 billion in annual interest payments. Let us just put that in context. That $12 billion would remove their excuse for trying to strip private health insurance rebates from millions of Australians. Secondly, it would pay for a national disability insurance scheme. Those two measures alone would be funded if this government had not racked up such extraordinary levels of debt—and not only that but it also means higher taxes in the future.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">This government falsely compares Australia to our neighbours and economic competitors, as if having a neighbour who owes more money than you is somehow a defence to the bank manager. The truth is, as we saw during the global financial crisis, we need a strong public sector to support the capital needs of this country. We have always been a serious and large importer of capital and our banks, which are substantial borrowers in wholesale funds markets overseas, need the strong public debt position of the Commonwealth in order to support those funding needs.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">This government talks about savings. The problem is that two-thirds of its savings actually come from increased tax imposts. We have a mining tax based on taxing iron ore, of which a former Labor minister for finance himself wrote that 'there is rarely if ever any economic rent in iron ore.' That was Peter Walsh, another ghost of Labor's past who would hang his head in shame when he looks at this government. Real tax reform does not increase the size of the state. This government may claim it is a lower taxing government, but it does not count if you are not collecting the taxes. What counts is what you spend. Every dollar this government does not collect in tax to fund its voracious spending is money that has to be paid by future Australian taxpayers.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We also have the flawed analysis that it is okay because debt is only seven per cent of GDP, as if GDP, every domestic dollar earned by the private and public sectors in this country, is somehow available for the government. The idea that we should measure ourselves on the basis of what the government could theoretically tax—every single dollar in the economy—is flawed. We are seeing that now in the countries of Europe and North America, and particularly western Europe and the United States, who for so long have rested easy in the delusion that they can keep increasing their public sector debt and measure it against a growing GDP. For some of those countries it is mathematically impossible for them to pay back their debt. I have seen an analysis of Ireland that shows Ireland can almost never pay back its debt because it can barely service the interest upon the debt that it recently took on. This government does not understand what it means to balance the budget over the economic cycle, other than the political cycle. The political cycle is that the ALP runs deficits and the coalition runs surpluses.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">
                  <span style="font-style:italic;" />We had a promise to run a surplus of one per cent of the Commonwealth budget, which has grown from $260 billion to $350 billion in four years. They promised, years out, a one per cent surplus. It suddenly became an aspiration, and very soon it will simply be another excuse. This party cannot manage our finances. Its contrived and confected empathy will be like a mythical surplus. <span style="font-style:italic;">(Time expired)</span></span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">
                  <a href="5K4" type="MemberSpeech">
                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Senator FAULKNER</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-State">New South Wales</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">16:19</span>): I would like to begin my contribution by acknowledging the courage of Senator Cormann in proposing a matter of public importance on budget surpluses. There he is, from the insecurity of a huge jerry-built glasshouse, daring to hurl some very small pebbles at the government. But, fortunately for Senator Cormann, he has a hide that really makes that of the average rhinoceros look wafer thin. Fortunately for him, he does not mind being accused of exaggeration, distortion and humbug. He likes being the fall guy for the opposition. He does not mind being a patsy for boldly going where no Liberal senator has been before and, I suspect, none are likely to go in the future.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Why did he do it? Why did he propose this matter of public importance? I do not know, but I would sincerely like to thank him for giving me the opportunity this afternoon to compare the economic credibil­ity of the government with that of the oppo­sition. After they have been exposed for their 2010 election costings black hole, which of course is a well-known debacle, this week we have a $70 billion black hole which threatens to swallow up an entire govern­ment department—the department of climate change—and 20,000 Commonwealth public servants along with it. The mantra of the opposition is that it will save more, spend less and deliver bigger budget surpluses. I think we know now that the opposition suffers from congenital innumeracy, so I think it is worth while having a closer look at this $70 billion black hole. Thirty seven billion dollars of it is in spending commit­ments the opposition announced in the 2010 election campaign, including $11 billion from the unwinding of the minerals resource rent tax. Then there is another $27 billion from the unwinding of the carbon tax. Finally, there is just a mere $7 billion or $8 billion to fund the income tax cuts that they promised. These are Mr Hockey and Mr Robb's figures; they are not mine. This is what Mr Hockey and Mr Robb have been telling their own colleagues they need to find in savings.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">What will this $70 billion in savings actually mean? The Prime Minister and ministers in the government have been very clear: it will mean stopping Medicare pay­ments for four years; it will mean stopping the age pension for two years; it will mean stopping assistance to people with disa­bilities for three years; and it will mean stopping the family tax benefit payments for three years.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">With the recent events in the global economy, it is obvious that Australia needs a steady hand on the tiller. The last thing we need are gigantic blank cheques and gigantic black holes from the opposition. The govern­ment's economic management has positioned Australia as one of the strongest, if not the strongest, economy in the developed world. Action taken by this government during the global financial crisis meant that we emerged from the global recession with strong growth, low unemploy­ment and solid public finances. Our economic stimulus package provided much-needed confidence at the time. It supported growth and protected jobs and it protected businesses as well. Because of this govern­ment's stimulus, Australia has emerged as virtually the only advanced economy to avoid recession and with a fiscal position that is the envy of the developed world. We have lower debt than other major developed economies, with the public net debt expected to peak at around one-tenth of that of other major developed economies.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The government has a clear path to bring the budget back to surplus well ahead of many comparable countries. Australia is one of only 14 major countries to have a AAA credit rating from the international rating agency Standard and Poor's. The government has been consistent and effective in imple­menting its fiscal strategy, constraining spending growth and putting in place responsible savings. That strategy has been endorsed by international rating agencies and the international community. In their article IV concluding statement released earlier this month, the IMF said this about the govern­ment's budget:</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Small">On fiscal policy, we commend the authorities for remaining committed to returning the Common­wealth budget to surplus by 2012/13 ... This consolidation is faster than in many other advanced economies and is more ambitious than earlier envisaged ...</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The international credit rating agency Moody's on 11 May this year said:</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Small">Moody's notes that Australia's government debt remains among the lowest of all AAA-rated governments.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Rating agency Standard and Poor's said that Australia has exceptionally strong public sector finances, underpinned by low public debt and strong fiscal discipline. But I always think in these matters of public importance the final word should go to the Liberal Party. A coalition MP was reported as saying after this year's budget reply:</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Small">We can’t keep agreeing with government spending measures opposing savings and revenue measures and keep our financial credibility intact.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Unfortunately, that was an anonymous Liberal Party MP, but Senator Cormann and the others who have spoken in the debate know who it is, as I know who it is—just check the <span style="font-style:italic;">Adelaide Advertiser</span> of 28 May this year. Then Senator Minchin, whom I know you respect very much, Mr Deputy President, and who was quite a hero to so many opposition senators, in his own newsletter of July this year said, 'If you err on the side of populism that is ultimately self-defeating because you end up standing for nothing.' Both the anonymous Liberal MP and Senator Minchin of course were right. I think Senator Cormann, the other Liberal senators and Senator Joyce from the National Party should take note of what their colleagues have said. I think that, really, Senator Fifield, who submitted this matter of public interest, and Senator Cormann, who proposed it to the Senate, should stop wasting the Senate's time on these matters. I stand by the economic credibility of the government and I believe that the facts on this speak for themselves.</span>

Unfortunately what we heard from Minister Ludwig was one of those wonderful contri­butions that goes something along the lines of, 'Trust us, we will work it out a little bit later.' This was basically his contribution in a nutshell: 'Yes, we are having discussions. We acknowledge there is a problem that needs to be addressed. We are working to find a way to address it'—the minister suggested it might take about a month to come up with that solution—'but we would be most appreciative if you would pass the bill in the meantime.' Unfortunately the 'Trust us, we'll fix it later' approach to government is something that we have come to be extraordinarily wary of when it comes to this government. We do not think that they can be trusted to sort things out later. Senator Xenophon and the coalition have worked together to put forward amendments to deal with issues particularly faced by the landfill gas sector because we want to know that there is going to be a solution. We also want to know that that solution will be in cast iron terms and acceptable, to make sure that we do not have the type of perverse outcomes that we have talked about previously.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">As I highlighted with a prior amendment, this amendment is one that particularly relates to the flow-on effects of the cessation of operation of the New South Wales Greenhouse Gas Abatement Scheme and how the Carbon Farming Initiative provides a capacity to pick up from there when that scheme ceases operation. The GGAS has driven landfill gas collection and CO<span style="text-decoration:none underline;">2</span> abate­ment from the waste sector quite effectively. The electricity generation projects built under that scheme, as well as under the Commonwealth's Greenhouse Friendly scheme, have been reliant upon income from offset credits. GGAS will cease at the point of a carbon price coming in and we are advised that without that type of credit support a number of these projects have the potential to become quite unviable. That is why we think that it is so important that we make sure that the viability of these projects is guaranteed and that they are secured for the future, wherever they are.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The Carbon Farming Initiative, as proposed by the government, could be a possible solution to this but unfortunately it is currently not. It does not do enough to ensure that those who went in early and did their best to capture emissions and do something constructive with them by generating electricity are not disadvantaged. We do not want to end up with the perverse outcome of having a government implement­ing a scheme that is designed and intended to ensure that we get a growth in emission abatement activities, but instead we risk seeing the possibility that the early mover advantage is lost and they cease those abatement activities. The Carbon Farming Initiative offset credits could and should be used in lieu of the credits that these schemes have previously relied upon. That is what we would hope to achieve out of the amend­ments that Senator Xenophon and the coalition have pursued. GGAS landfill projects are not, of course, specifically identified on the positive list, and a number of them are required to collect some gas, under their EPA licences, for odour control and safety. Under the bill as it is proposed, projects must be on the positive list, or not be required by law, and may have a baseline applied. Industry is concerned that this creates uncertainty, given questions as to how much gas must be collected by law, about whether they may in fact be excluded from the CFI and, if not, what the accepted baseline is that will be applied. We have attempted to address those issues in the amendments that have been put forward. To resolve this, it has been suggested that these landfill gas projects be added, with a standardised baseline to cover off these issues, so that they can continue with some certainty and continue to operate commercially and effectively.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The landfill gas industry is important and it is significant. In 2009, waste in landfills generated total emissions of 15½ million-plus tonnes of CO<span style="text-decoration:none underline;">2</span> equivalent, of which around 4½ million were recovered. That is a good, positive effect and it shows a baseline around 29 per cent. However, industry is concerned about whether that is a fair or effective indication of common practice, especially because a large proportion of the abatement was due to GGAS and GHF landfill gas projects. Those GGAS landfill gas projects, I am advised, accounted for abatement of around 3.3 million tonnes of CO<span style="text-decoration:none underline;">2</span> equivalent, or more than 20 per cent of landfill emissions in 2009. It has been estimated that GHF, Greenhouse Friendly, landfill gas projects accounted for abatement of around 700,000 tonnes of CO<span style="text-decoration:none underline;">2</span> equivalent. So when you take out the GGAS and GHF, Greenhouse Friendly, projects the raw baseline number of existing activity is reduced to below five per cent, on these sums.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The industry concede they do not see that as a realistic baseline and acknowledge that some abatement that would have occurred from these other incentive schemes would have occurred in any event for other reasons. They argue that a 10 per cent national baseline for GGAS landfill projects would be realistic. We have set out some figures in these amendments that set dual standards dealing with the different schemes that have been in operation to date. Given the proven nature of the technology involved here and the activities that are underway, and given of course the reliability of the existing schemes and the manner in which they have been built up—they have been voluntarily entered into and have had significant investments made in them; not unreasonably, as a result of the incentives that were there—it is important to make sure that they are accommodated under the Carbon Farming Initiative. I know the minister gave some assurances that they would be but, as I said before, assurances, promises and 'she'll be right, mate' type commitments do not quite cut it anymore. We want to know that there is an agreement in place that provides certainty for these facilities, whether they are the facilities in Bendigo or Ballarat, the facilities in Tweed shire or Newcastle, or the facility in Launceston—facilities, I am told, that could be jeopardised if we get this wrong. From those landfill sites we would then see increased emissions escaping and have the perverse outcome that in passing this and getting it wrong we have actually increased emissions in parts of the economy. That would make absolutely no sense to anybody. I think everybody in the chamber who has spoken on this to date has agreed that that type of outcome would make no sense. Senator Xenophon and the coalition are attempting to prescribe a solution to ensure that that would not be the case. We think that getting a solution in the legislation in the here and now is the best way to take this forward.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We are pleased that Senator Milne and the Greens have acknowledged that there needs to be a solution and we are pleased that the government have acknowledged that there needs to be a solution. The concern, though, is that the government have to date failed to provide any reassurance to the parliament on what that solution will be and how it will be applied and, importantly, failed to provide reassurance to industry to make sure they are confident in and comfortable about the manner in which this will move ahead.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">So I would leave the challenge there for the minister. We would hope to get something far more certain than the words he uttered before question time on this matter. If we do not, we will certainly be persevering with this amendment. Obviously, unless we proceed very quickly through this, he will have at least an extra couple of days to come up with something that provides all parties—and I would trust that Senator Xenophon and the Greens feel likewise—with a lot more confidence that a solution is there than what he has said to date.</span>

                    </a> (<span class="HPS-State">Tasmania</span>—<span class="HPS-MinisterialTitles">Deputy Leader of the Australian Greens</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">16:44</span>):  Earlier today, in making my contribution on this amendment and acknowledging the problem that we had, I indicated that I would be taking a watching brief according to what has been negotiated in discussions between all parties, with the Greens talking to the LNC, Senator Xenophon and the govern­ment. I have had further meetings in relation to this and I am now satisfied that there will be an outcome within a month that will set an appropriate baseline that is fair and takes into account what would have occurred otherwise and what can genuinely be regarded as additional. I am satisfied that we will get to that outcome within a month to the satisfaction of all parties. The sooner that can happen the better for all parties concer­ned. I thank the industry across Australia for having drawn the attention of the Senate to what could have been a perverse or bad outcome. That is one of the good things about having a community engaged with legislation as it goes through—you can actually get to address some of these issues.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">One of the main concerns I have about the amendment is the impact on the integrity of the DOIC as it has been established. The whole point here was to have an independent and rigorous assessment of methodologies and have a body that can come up with baselines and methodologies for the kinds of numbers that we come up with that are rigorous and can be defended in any fora, both domestic and global. I want to make sure that we do not have political direction of the DOIC which would undermine at the start the very idea of having an independent integrity commission.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">At the same time I want to make sure that there would not be job losses or the closing down of facilities that are assisting us in reducing our emissions across Australia. I indicate to the Senate that the Greens will be opposing this amendment for that reason. I am satisfied that we have now reached a conclusion that will be satisfactory to all parties. I also put on the record that if a resolution of this issue does not occur in the next four weeks to the satisfaction of all parties, we will be discussing it again.</span>

                    </a> (<span class="HPS-State">South Australia</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">16:47</span>):  I am grateful for Senator Milne's contribution and also for her intervention. She has taken a keen interest in trying to get a resolution to this carbon emissions matter. I agree with the sentiments of what she is saying. If this amendment is lost—it is not a criticism of the government in any way—I worry about what remedy there is if there is an unsatisfactory solution. That is a genuine question. If the amendment is lost, what recourse can LMS, and other entities that have been doing good work on greenhouse gas abatement over many years, have? What are they left with? I accept from the minister that the negotiations are proceeding with goodwill but I am concerned that, in the absence of a legislative framework, these entities are vulnerable. They have done the right thing.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">It is worth reflecting on recommendation No.1 of the Senate Environment and Communications Legislation Committee into this Carbon Farming Initiative legislation. Paragraph 2.36 states very clearly:</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">The committee recommends the government consider options to ensure there are no perverse incentives to cease existing abatement projects, and encourage first movers to undertake further abatement or sequestration activities under the Carbon Farming Initiative.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The devil is in the detail. If a formula is not set by legislation, which is my preferred outcome and that of my co-sponsor, my colleague Senator Birmingham—we moved this jointly, with Senator Birmingham doing so on behalf of the opposition—then we will have some difficulty. It is regrettable that it has had to come to this, that an amendment had to be introduced, but Senator Milne took a very active and laudable role in trying to deal with this matter and that was most welcome. I know this sector is very grateful for Senator Milne's interest and intervention but it is still not quite resolved, and that makes me very nervous. That is why it is important to proceed with this amendment.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">If this amendment is defeated—it appears the numbers are not here to pass it—what recourse will there be if there is a stumbling block in negotiations? Secondly, as I understand it, there are some figures that are toing and froing on baselines. I know that negotiations have been taking place with goodwill on the part of the department and the minister's office and the industry sector, but what safeguards are there if there is a breakdown in negotiations? Are we back to square one and back to the uncertainty? These are businesses that need to look at their financing or refinancing, and the uncertaity would be a significant factor in their long-term commercial survival. Despite the fact that I accept everyone's goodwill on this issue, I wonder how we deal with that conundrum,?</span>

It is important to maintain the integrity of the system. Senator Milne said it in a perhaps shorter way than I am about to, but this amendment seeks to take things outside the available procedures that have been established to make sure that in an international setting those people who look at the integrity of the system see that it is not compromised. </span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This amendment avoids the methodology; it avoids having an independent assessment. It puts in a specific clause that would open up the ability for others to come along and say, 'We have our own specific circum­stances and we therefore want a legislative solution. We want the same as the landfill industry.' You open up the integrity and put it in jeopardy. Secondly, dealing with what I think Senator Xenophon talked about, this is not a negotiation. It is very important to keep that in mind—it is not a negotiation.</span>

                    </a>  It is not a negotiation; it is an evidence based way of gaining what the baseline would be. So you do not sit in a room, as with industrial relations, and bargain about what the baseline should or should not be. It is about an evidence based outcome. Why? Because internationally we want to maintain the integrity of the system. To do that there has to be an independent assessment. It has to be evidence based and the methodology has to be followed. That is why we do not support a separate individual amendment dealing with one industry which then bypasses that. You would want them to go through and develop the methodologies—evidence based metho­dologies—and have the independent assess­ment to ensure the integrity of the system so that where it lands it is supported by the evidence.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Ultimately it is a legislative instrument and if people disagree with it, it will come back here as a legislative instrument. We all know that, if the legislative instruments get it right, they generally go through this place. If they do not then there is an opportunity for those people to disallow the instruments in the Senate if they do not think they got it right. That does mean, however, that if it is disallowed it will have to go back through the process again. But that is what people can decide to choose in the Senate—it is always an option available to us. So it is much better to deal with it in that way than to simply mandate through what is ultimately an amendment to the bill, which would then be an amendment to the act, which is specific and about only one industry. It then goes around the actual integrity of the system. So what you are doing in one fell swoop is making sure that the bill itself, if it were to be passed with this amendment, would already have a hole in it; it would have a landfill—it would make sure that it would be criticised for not being able to stand up to scrutiny and not having an independent process to assess each of the methodologies. So to deal with Senator Xenophon's issue around negotiation, it is consultation, sure; but it is evidence based to arrive at appro­priate, researched figures which are backed up by the evidence. So it is not a bargain. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Lastly, to deal with the issue of ensuring that everybody got it right—it is a legislative instrument; people can decide in here that they did not get it right and make their own judgments about that. But first and foremost it is, with the best of government intention, designed to solve this in a very short space in time—because we do recognise there is an issue that needs to be resolved, but the way to resolve it is to use the framework.</span>

                    </a> (<span class="HPS-State">South Australia</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">16:56</span>):  I am fired up now. I appreciate the minister's answer, but it is a negotiation. The minister says it is not a negotiation, it is not collective bargaining, it is not a plea bargain—but it is a negotiation about a structure to ensure that there is some fairness and equity in this. This is not a surprise to the government or to the department. This has been going on for month after month after month. LMS have been knocking on doors, trying to get an equitable outcome here, warning of the perverse outcomes. You had the Senate committee making very clear in their first recommendation that the government should consider options to ensure there are no perverse incentives. They have been saying that the incentives are perverse under the current bill. We have had this eleventh-hour approach—and thank goodness for Senator Milne's intervention in this to try and get a just outcome, an equitable outcome, an environmentally sound outcome—and yet we are still talking about something that should have been resolved months ago. How many months have to pass, how many doors do they have to knock on, to get this outcome? This is not acceptable.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This is something that the government was aware of and was warned about; the minister's office was aware of it. And yet we still have a situation where there is a lack of certainty; there is continued uncertainty in what is being proposed. So why will it take a month? My question to the minister is: why on earth will it take a month, when you have been on notice about this for many, many months? Why can't we get a formula in place that gives certainty to this sector, which has been an early adopter—in fact, the first adopters, I would dare to say—of greenhouse gas abatement?</span>

                    </a> (<span class="HPS-State">South Australia</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">16:58</span>):  If I can just add to Senator Xenophon's question of why will it take a month, and put a slightly different perspective on that question: Minister, if you are going to follow all of the processes laid out in the act, if it is going to be a fully independent determination of the DOIC, how are you going to do it in a month? By the time this legislation goes back to the other place, is dealt with, is proclaimed, and then you have gone through the appointments processes of the membership of the committee who do all of their determinations and come up with a methodology as pre­scribed in the legislation, how on earth are you going to provide that certainty within such a short space of time? It strikes me that your arguments conflict with one another. It strikes me that on the one hand you are saying, 'We want to deal with this quickly; and trust us, we can and will deal with this quickly and provide certainty to this sector', but on the other hand you are saying we have to go through all of the processes laid out in this bill to maintain the integrity of it. It strikes me that it is utterly impossible for you to be able to go through all of the processes laid out in this bill, maintain the integrity of it and at the same time achieve an outcome in a very short period of time. So which is it, Minister? Is it a negotiation—which you claim it is not—that will give us an outcome in a short space of time, or is it rather a proper process of the bill which will leave this industry hanging in limbo and uncert­ainty until such time as all those of processes have gone through; and of course it will be quite some time before we actually see those regulations relating to these methodologies come back to this place.</span>

            <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Normal">
                <a href="182468" type="MemberSpeech">
                  <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Senator THISTLETHWAITE</span>
                </a> (<span class="HPS-State">New South Wales</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">17:00</span>):  Thank you, Mr President. I acknowledge the traditional owners of this land and pay my respects to their elders. In 1972, a wharfie working at Sydney's Hungry Mile docks was seriously injured when he fell from a container on a ship that he was unloading. He suffered numerous injuries. He fractured his pelvis and his arm, injured his back and suffered internal injuries. As a result of these injuries he would never work again as a wharfie, he would never earn the same level of income and he and his wife would never own their own home. He was hospitalised for five weeks. His rehabilitation took six months.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Normal">During this time he received no support or assistance from his employer, whom he had served for 30 years. Not once did a representative of the company that he was proud to work for contact him to check on his wellbeing or his family. In times when workers compensation did not adequately cover a worker's lost income, this hard­working family man worried about how he would get by. How would they keep their house and pay their bills with little income? But the family did get by. And they did manage to survive financially for one simple reason—he was a member of his union, the Waterside Workers Federation. That wharfie, Cliff Spradbrow, was my grandfather.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Normal">Each week the union organiser, Tas Bull, would visit Cliff in hospital and he also gave assistance to my grandmother, Mary. Cliffs' mates at work passed the hat around and with the union ensured that there was money to keep paying the rent and bills. The union secretary regularly called to check on Cliff's welfare and ensured that the family never went without. My grandmother regularly tells me of her gratitude to the union during that testing time.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Normal">An appreciation for the role that trade unions play in our workplaces and our society was instilled in me from an early age. My other grandfather, Ralph Thistlethwaite, worked in the Postmaster-General's Depart­ment for 48 years. He was a morse code specialist. He was also a life member and NSW branch secretary of his union, the Australian Postmasters Association. My father, Bruce, was the vice-president of his union, the Flight Attendants Association.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Normal">My parents embody those great working class values of their generation: hard work, fairness and community activism. Because of the sacrifices my parents made, I was the first in my family to gain a university education. I thank and pay tribute to my parents, Bruce and Lorraine, for their sacrifice, their support and their belief and also for planting and nurturing in me the values of fairness, participation and hard work.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Normal">Involvement in the community was a value that was upheld in my family. My grandfather Ralph was a life member of the South Sydney Rugby League Football Club. For 25 years he was involved in the admin­istration of the club and he volunteered at every Souths game for most of his life. 'Always support the Rabbitohs and always vote Labor,' he would say. Despite the fact that the Rabbitohs regularly test my faith, I am pleased to inform the Senate that I have never deviated from this advice. For many years, during my time as a university student, I worked at the South Sydney Junior Rugby League Club.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Normal">My father was an active member of Maroubra Surf Lifesaving Club and the day after my 13th birthday he took me to join the surf club. I remain an active member to this day. Maroubra is one of Australia's first surf clubs and a foundation member of Surf Life Saving Australia, with arguably the greatest competitive history of any club in Australia when it comes to national champions and Olympic representatives.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Normal">Local legend is that Maroubra is an Aboriginal word for 'windy place' and with an easterly aspect Maroubra catches all winds and swells. This regularly produces powerful, unforgiving surf conditions, which means that Maroubra lifesavers are often tested and need to be superbly trained to protect the safety of the public each summer. I have always said that the best management course I ever did was being in charge of 15 lifesavers on patrol at Maroubra when that surf was menacing. By becoming involved in the management of this community organi­sation, I was inspired to greater heights of community activism that led me to this place and the great honour of representing the Australian Labor Party, and the people of New South Wales, in the Australian Senate.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Normal">Along the way I have had the pleasure of working with some of the unsung heroes of my local community and our state. I have seen people risk their lives in treacherous seas to save another. I have worked with people who give every spare second of their time to ensuring our kids can handle them­selves in the surf, or training others in how to resuscitate a life. These are the people who personify community and make Australia a proud but safe nation of coastal dwellers.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Normal">In 2006 I had the honour of being President of Maroubra Surf Lifesaving Club in its centenary year, a milestone for our club, our community, and something that I will cherish forever. I have also been active in the Police and Community Youth Clubs movement and worked with many volunteers who try to prevent kids who have come from broken homes or tough financial circumstances from going off the rails, and to help them get back on track if they do. The PCYC and surf lifesaving movements gave me the discipline and passion to work hard for my community, and I am pleased to be able to acknowledge today the great work of their many members in the community.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Normal">During my days as an economics student at the University of New South Wales, I often questioned the neoclassical view of economics and efficiency of markets producing optimal social outcomes without accounting for the realities of life, factors such as intergenerational poverty, mental illness or discrimination—the human factors which quite often cannot be modelled or predicted yet are the bread and butter of the work of governments. In the union move­ment I found a vocation that allowed my beliefs to be put into practice.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Normal">For 10 years I had the great honour of serving the members of Australia's oldest and proudest trade union, the Australian Workers Union. John Curtin once described the AWU as 'the greatest organisation of labour that our country has known'. I believe he was right. Over 125 years, the AWU has advanced the incomes, conditions and lifestyles of working Australians and their families, and it continues to do so today. As an organiser I represented workers in a diverse range of industries. This role gave me a thorough appreciation of the issues and challenges facing business, workers and their families. I travelled extensively throughout New South Wales, meeting rural workers and viewing the importance of industry to regional economies and communities.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Normal">When I began as an official, I was part of a rare breed of university educated recruits to union officialdom. This period marked a change in union culture and practice, driven by the Australian Council of Trade Unions and put into practice at the AWU by the state secretary, Russ Collison. Russ is a person who has devoted his entire working life to advancing the interests of his fellow members and workers. He has led the AWU through tough times and ensured the union remained united and a strong voice for its members in New South Wales. I thank Russ for his trust and confidence in me.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Normal">As an official of Unions NSW I was fortunate to work with a group of people who changed the face of progressive work­place and political campaigning in this country. When the Howard government Work Choices legislation became law, it allowed the most vulnerable workers in all industries to be forced to negotiate as individuals, exploiting that natural power imbalance that exists when employer and employee try to strike an economic bargain—or, as the father of capitalism, Adam Smith, once described it: 'Upon all ordinary occasions, the master shall have the advantage in the dispute with the individual worker and force the latter into compliance with their terms.' Unfortunately, Work Choices allowed many employers to force young workers, the unskilled, part-timers and women into compliance with terms below those traditionally established as fair and reasonable by independent umpires. I re­member, during this time, the phone calls from the parents of those young retail workers, asking how it could be possible, in a modern economy like Australia, that their son or daughter could be forced to negotiate, as an individual, an individual contract on a 'take it or leave it' basis that had no overtime for working on weekends, no shift penalties for working at night and no minimum engagement.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Normal">Work Choices allowed these deals to be made. When the reality set in, we were challenged by the visionary leader of the New South Wales union movement, John Robertson, to develop a campaign that would change the views of union members, the wider community and this law. The result was the Your Rights at Work campaign. Never before had our nation seen a workplace and political campaign so carefully planned, skilfully targeted and delivered with such discipline. The Your Rights at Work campaign changed the face of campaigning, it changed community senti­ment and it changed a government. But, most importantly, it also changed the lives of the marginalised and the vulnerable in our workplaces and restored their rights. I am proud to have been part of this historic movement for social change.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Normal">At Unions NSW I had the privilege of being an advocate for the thousands of low-paid workers in New South Wales in the annual minimum wage review cases in the Industrial Relations Commission. Through these cases, we sought to lift the minimum wage to ensure the incomes of the low paid kept pace with the cost of living. Each year, these large employer associations opposed our application and claimed that granting an extra $18 a week to cleaners, hotel workers, childcare workers and the like would result in job losses. But they could never present any credible economic evidence to back their claims, and such wage increases never did destroy jobs. In fact, in all of the years that I was involved in minimum wage cases, the economy grew, jobs were created and profits in these industries grew—probably because a few extra dollars in the pockets of the low paid ended up being spent in the local economy.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Normal">Minimum wage cases require detailed evidence of the plight of low-paid workers. Very brave workers assisted by telling the stories of their week-to-week battle to earn enough money to feed and clothe their family. For these people, a meal at a restaurant, a night at the movies or a family holiday are considered a luxury and a rare occurrence. These are the hardworking Australians who rely on us to make work­place laws that ensure their vulnerability cannot be exploited, so they can earn an in­come that allows them to live. These are the people who rely on us to establish a taxation system that is fair and ensures that the incen­tive to work is not crowded out by welfare.</span>

              <span class="HPS-Normal">It was my great privilege to work with the many members and officials of the union movement. I pay tribute to the leaders, officials and members of these great organisations for their commitment to a better life for workers and their families.</span>

              <span class="HPS-Normal">Labor is Australia's party of progress. We are the party of the Snowy Mountains scheme, the party of Medicare, the party of superannuation and the party of native title. The Labor platform, and its embodiment in policy, represents progress—progress for workers and their families, progress for communities and progress for our nation. Labor is the party of economic growth with a fair society. We are the party that ensures that the plight of my grandfather no longer occurs in our workplaces. Progress involves an understanding of the great economic and social challenges our nation faces and the resolve to deal with them. This approach is evident in the Labor government's policy to deal with the biggest economic and social challenge of our generation—the challenge of mitigating the effects of human induced global warming on our economy and our society whilst protecting the livelihoods of Australian workers and businesses.</span>

            <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Normal">As a person who regularly enjoys our beautiful coastline and beaches, I am concerned about the scientific evidence of ocean warming and its effects. Over the last 25 years I have competed at many Australian Surf Life Saving Championships, the 'Aussies', as they are affectionately known. This annual event is the largest sporting event in our nation. It attracts thousands of competitors from each state and ploughs millions of dollars into the local hosting economy. In 1992 the Aussies were held at Collaroy Beach north of Sydney. It is no longer possible to hold this event at Collaroy or many of Sydney's other beautiful beaches. Quite simply there is no longer enough sand on the beach to run the events.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Normal">In March this year the New South Wales Surf Life Saving Championships were held in Kingscliff in the far north of New South Wales. Participants and supporters would not have been aware that in November last year Tweed Shire Council received about $600,000 from the New South Wales government's Natural Disaster Relief Arrangements to restore Kingscliff Beach due to beach erosion. Only four weeks ago the sand that had been deposited was wiped out. The council has again had to spend almost $400,000 sandbagging the local surf club and caravan park and now faces a $3 million plus bill to pump sand from the Tweed River onto the beach to save them from inundation.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Normal">Scientists tell us that the warming of our oceans is raising sea levels and even with urgent mitigation this trend looks set to continue long term. We cannot solely attri­bute these specific events to climate change. Indeed, inappropriate coastal development over the last 100 years in many coastal communities has resulted in an ongoing history of erosion and property damage. But scientists tell us that sea level rise and more extreme weather events as a result of climate change will have further negative impacts. With an increasing frequency of high sea level events expected into the future, this scientific evidence should sound the alarm. At the very least, it should justify mitigation action by our national government. The longer we wait to tackle climate change, the greater the cost. As a father of two young children, I do not want to risk their opportunity to enjoy the beauty of our magnificent coastline. I do not want to saddle them with the burden of unbearable costs to mitigate the damage of climate change. Most importantly, I do not want to have to tell them that I, as a legislator and custodian of the welfare of the people of New South Wales, did not have the courage, skill and foresight to deal with an issue that will, more likely than not, reduce the quality of their life and the natural environment that they inherit. I am committed to working with my fellow senators and MPs to deal with this great challenge for our nation and our world.</span>

            <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Normal">I live in a seaside community that values healthy lifestyles. While I have enjoyed the benefits of good health, I realise there are a large number of Australians who every day suffer the consequences of unhealthy living. My wife Rachel is a nurse at a major public hospital. She regularly lets me know of the burden preventable disease has on our hospital system. I am told that the increasing prevalence of obesity, heart disease and diabetes impacts on the workload of all health professionals and also on the wallets of Australian taxpayers. The preventable nature of major illness in Australia should be cause for concern for any government. With an ageing population and greater prevalence of unhealthy living amongst Australians, we face the prospect of an ever-increasing health budget related to preventable disease. There is more to be done in this area and I look forward to doing all I can to ensure more Australians, particularly those from low-income households, enjoy the benefits of a healthy life and reduce the burdens on our health system.</span>

              <span class="HPS-Normal">My election to the Senate was achieved with the support and hard work of others. I thank the officers and staff of the Senate for their dedication to good government and their assistance since my election. I acknowledge and thank my predecessor, Mike Forshaw, a diligent and honourable Labor man who served in this place with distinction. I thank him for his friendship and wise advice. I owe a deep gratitude to the members of the New South Wales Labor Party, whose hard work and commitment to equality and justice is an inspiration and a privilege to represent. I particularly recog­nise those in rural and regional New South Wales who, against the odds, never waver in their commitment to uphold the fine ideals of our party. To my former colleagues in the New South Wales Labor Party office, whose hard work and ability is unending and admirable, I say: thank you for your support and friendship. I thank Andrew Gray and all of those whom I had the pleasure of working with at Mallesons Stephen Jaques for new insights and for sharpening my legal skills and knowledge.</span>

              <span class="HPS-Normal">I wish to recognise my wife's very large family, the Casamentos, in particular Joe and Lis, and thank them for their support, their warmth and their dedication to their family; I am honoured to be part of it. To my beautiful daughters, Amelie and Scarlett, who remind me every day that there is no greater joy than being their father and receiving their uncon­ditional love, I hope to make you both proud of my work as a senator. I thank and pay tribute to my beautiful wife, Rachel, for her eternal support, patience, wise advice and love. My election to this place is a testament to your faith and to our partnership.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">
                  <a href="2M6" type="MemberSpeech">
                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Senator COONAN</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-State">New South Wales</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">17:25</span>):  by leave—Firstly, I want to con­gratulate Senator Thistlethwaite on his first speech and I wish him well in his career. I thank the Senate very much for allowing me this opportunity to make some remarks in anticipation of my imminent retirement from this chamber, where I have had the privilege of serving for the past 15 years, including seven years in the ministry and, collectively, nine years on the front bench. My departure will mark the end of an era of sorts as I am the last Howard government cabinet minister still serving in the Senate.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">My term does not expire until 2014, so it is with a good deal of soul searching that I have come to my decision, knowing that the constitutional and conventional arrangements for filling a casual vacancy will not cause inconvenience to my party or to the people of New South Wales who re-elected me for a third term in 2007. That said, it is not a decision that I have come to lightly. However politics, as I am sure everybody here will know, is a journey and not a destination and each of us has to make the journey as we see fit. The day will come for all of us when, no matter how long one serves and no matter at what level, it is time to move on and for me that time is fast approaching.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Having entered the Senate in the great ascension of the Howard government in 1996, I have been extraordinarily privileged to have served at some of the highest levels of government available to a senator, first as the Minister for Revenue and Assistant Treasurer, then as a cabinet minister as the Minister for Communications, Information Technology and the Arts, and Deputy Leader of the Government in the Senate. These appointments gave me my fair share of firsts being, so far as I am aware, the only woman thus far to have held a Treasury portfolio and the first woman to join a federal coalition government's leadership team. It was certainly some team, comprising the Prime Minister John Howard, Peter Costello, Nick Minchin and, from the Nationals, Warren Truss and Mark Vaile. Having served only on the government benches until the Howard government lost office in November 2007, it is fair to say that the dark days of opposition are indeed an apt description. Despite being in the shadow ministry until I stepped back in late 2009, I have not relished the battle as fervently as I did as a minister. It is now time for me to take up new challenges.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Whilst I do not intend to be partisan in my comments today, I do believe that Tony Abbott and the coalition have done an admirable job of pointing out, if I can borrow the term, 'the wilful blindness' of the Gillard government which seems incapable of avoiding successive policy and political blunders and missteps that should be obvious to those who look. Of course I am immen­sely proud to have been a minister in the Howard government, a government that was capable not only of announcing but of imple­menting big economic reform, competently managing the economy and delivering good government for the Australian people. We left the nation free of debt and with a healthy surplus for a rainy day that played a key role in insulating Australia from the worst of the global financial crisis in 2008.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I am grateful to former Prime Minister John Howard for the opportunities he gave me and for his leadership and support throughout my ministerial career. I was fortunate to have been promoted straight into the ministry as the Minister for Revenue and Assistant Treasurer after the 2001 election victory. One of my tasks was to smooth the rough edges in the implementation of the GST and to implement the major business tax reforms identified in the Ralph review. It involved complex but important reforms for the business community, such as consoli­dation of group accounts and demergers, and also involved administrative oversight of the Australian Taxation Office.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I also had carriage of some very major reforms to superannuation, including choice of funds and portability of accounts, and the introduction by the government of the co-contribution for low-income earners wishing to save for their own retirement. Another superannuation reform of which I am particularly proud was the capacity to split superannuation on divorce, a much needed reform which primarily benefited women. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">In any portfolio, crises can come out of the clear blue sky and, having just climbed into the saddle, I was tasked with the enormous challenge of dealing with and resolving the crisis that had swept through Australia's insurance market, partly as a fallout from the collapse of the general insurer HIH. The exorbitant cost of claims, skyrocketing premiums and the inability to get insurance at any price had almost shut down public activity. This crisis affected everything from pony clubs to medical practitioners, who had threatened to withdraw their services because of the risk of being sued many years after the event and the cost of long tail claims.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">With my state counterparts—all of whom were Labor Treasurers or ministers and to whom I pay tribute for their policy courage—we were able to agree upon sweeping reforms to tort law that reshaped the delivery of insurance and public liability in medical indemnity and for professional services across Australia. Cooperation and agreement of all the states with the federal government is increasingly rare and difficult to achieve. This was an example of cooperation at its best.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The Australian Prudential Regulatory Authority also came under my bailiwick and the aftermath of the HIH collapse paved the way for major reform of Australia's pru­dential regulation of financial institutions. These reforms, and the soundness of the regulatory settings then introduced, have been acknowledged as a key factor, contri­buting to Australia's resilience to external shocks and capacity to withstand the worst effects of global financial volatility.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I acknowledge the key role played by the then Treasurer, Peter Costello, that underpinned the stellar performance of the Treasury portfolios during the Howard years. Serving on the Expenditure Review Committee with Peter Costello and Nick Minchin was a memorable experience. Not many 'dishing it out' ministers, if I can use the colloquial expression, got past the corporate memory of Peter Costello, who delivered the budget year on year, had seen it all before and knew better than most how to reel it in. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">In the vast Communications portfolio, I inherited many policy challenges, including some major unfinished business; to get legislation passed to enable completion of the sale of Telstra and to reform media regulation that had been in place, virtually untouched, for over 20 years. This was when rapid advances in technology were—and they still are—transforming the media land­scape, making existing regulatory settings of converged platforms, with global reach, increasingly redundant. Technological inno­vation has simply transformed the way we live, work, learn and do business not only in Australia but across the globe.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Such is the nature of fast paced tech­nological change that we cannot today even imagine devices and applications that will likely be commonplace just a few years from now. So I have a degree of empathy with any minister or policymaker charged with developing communications policy in an environment where the target is always moving. Recent reports of new experimental wireless technology, for example, if proven may well allow access to the internet up to a thousand times faster than is possible now on conventional wireless networks, without the drawback of degraded speeds with multiple users of the network.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I hasten to add this is experimental technology and, yes, wireless applications do need access to fibre backhaul to connect to the network, but I believe the lessons to be learned from rapid technological change are these. Firstly, there are enormous hazards inherent in picking one dominant tech­nology—fibre to the home—for a new ubiquitous network when all the risk is being borne by taxpayers who will likely be left with a suboptimal network when something more efficient comes along, as it surely will over a 10-year rollout. Secondly, taxpayers are right to wonder whether an investment of some $50 to $80 billion is worth the money when there is no guarantee that a spend even of that magnitude will future-proof Austra­lia's telecommunication infrastructure needs for the future.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">It is indefensible, in my view, that Australians in rural and remote areas have been denied the benefits of fast, affordable broadband that would have been available to them for the past three years under the OPEL network. OPEL was just a part of my vision in 2006 to meet the needs of rural and regional Australia and I believe it remains relevant today. Sacrificing OPEL on the altar of the costly NBN experiment has meant only a handful of people in mainland Austra­lia have taken up the service thus far.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">This is an unfinished story, a work in progress. At least we all agree on the objective that every Australian should be able to access fast, affordable broadband regardless of where they live. I, for one, consider that this basic guarantee should be provided in the universal service obligation. The days when it is sufficient to guarantee Australians a phone on the wall have well and truly been superseded by the need for access to a fast and affordable broadband service, regardless of where you live.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I now want to make some brief remarks about two issues of enormous importance to Australia's future prosperity and of particular relevance to those in the chamber and no doubt in the other place. Irrespective of the fate of the carbon tax under this or successive governments, the politics of clean energy in Australia still has some distance to run. There is a surreal quality surrounding this debate on the introduction of the carbon tax, which the Prime Minister has effectively said is 'done—it's going through', at a time when the developed world is facing once again enormous volatility in financial markets. The Eurozone is hovering on the brink of default, the United States has only just averted a crisis on its massive debt burden, and Australia is grappling with how to close the gap in our two-speed economy. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">As business and consumer confidence plummets, I do worry that insufficient weight is being given in this debate to the impact of introducing a carbon tax in such uncertain economic times and whether Australia can afford to forfeit its comparative advantage in access to cheap energy that has thus far underpinned a commodity boom that has reshaped Australia's economy in the 21st century.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Australia has other pressing challenges, including developing a more transparent and coherent approach to foreign investment, most particularly from China. We must not lose sight of the importance of foreign investment as a key ingredient underpinning Australia's long-term growth. But many Australians have become uneasy about whether such investment for mining pur­poses, most particularly coal seam gas exploration licences, will affect prime agricultural land and question the impact this might have on Australia's land use and future food security. These concerns are not with­out foundation.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Although issues related to land use are primarily state responsibilities, surely it should not be beyond our collective wit as a nation to devise a framework which maps and designates prime agricultural land that should be conserved in the national interest, but not so as to discourage forms of foreign investment that will allow the responsible management of multiple land use. I have no illusions that there will be hard decisions to be made in striking the right balance and possible recompense required for owners of such land, whose use could be impacted. But in my view there cannot be too many more compelling national priorities than balancing protection of prime agricultural land as a key part of ensuring Australia's food security with managing the mining boom.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">And now for some acknowledgements and long overdue thankyous. Firstly, to the members of the Liberal Party, to Bill Heffernan, who was State President of the Liberal Party when I started my political journey, and to the Senate selectors who placed their confidence in me to represent them and the people of the Premier State of NSW for three terms: thank you.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Next I would like to thank particular mentors and supporters to whom I owe a great debt of gratitude for their support and encouragement over time, including Sir John Carrick, the Hon. Nick Greiner, Rosemary Foot, Charles Curran, John Azarius, John Wells, Peter Collins, Max Moore-Wilton, Tony Nutt and Arthur Sinodinos.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">It will no doubt come as a surprise to many to learn of my affection for the former Prime Minister the Hon. Gough Whitlam, who was an accidental witness at my wedding in Paris some 30 years ago and who is still kind enough to refer to me as 'the Bride'. My parents, being staunch Liberals, doubted the validity of that marriage certificate, and we had another commitment ceremony back in Sydney to put the matter beyond doubt! I had the great privilege of visiting him recently and at 95 I can say that he is still a formidable comrade.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">On matters of the heart it is difficult to convey the depth of my love and appreciation for my husband, the Hon. Andrew Rogers, my son Adam Coonan, and his wife, Candice, and baby, Camille Juliette, who is the light of our lives. Thank you for the involuntary sacrifices you made to let me follow my passion so completely for such a long time. To all the members of my large extended family, my stepdaughters and their children, my sisters and friends: thank you for bearing with me, tolerating my absences and still being there for me. My loving parents, Bill and Mary Lloyd, gave me my values and taught me resilience. They were not here to see most of my ministerial career, but I hope I have done them proud.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">To my wonderful staff, each and every one of you, who have been the public face of my office: thank you. I cannot name everyone—in 15 years, you have a few!—but particularly mention Nicole Masters, Peta Credlin and my current chief of staff, Ainsley Gotto, who has a long history of working for senators, as exemplary chiefs of staff. I particularly thank Jane McMillan, Shaun Anthony, Matt Stafford, Rachel da Costa, Sarah Cullins, Sarah McNamara, Richard Shields, Jeff Egan, Edora David and Mary-Lou Jarvis for their friendships and for giving their all when it mattered.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">And of course I must thank Rosemary Laing, the Clerk, the Clerk's committee secretaries, chamber attendants, Hansard and Black Rod, past and present, who have always given such professional and unstint­ing service to senators. This is much appreciated. I miss Cleaver Elliott in retire­ment and my dear friend former Deputy Clerk Anne Lynch, who has departed not only the Senate but unfortunately this mortal coil.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Finally I thank my Senate colleagues, too numerous to mention individually—I am happy to say on both sides of the chamber—for their friendship, courtesy and support, especially over these last difficult weeks. I believe Eric Abetz and George Brandis are doing a fine job. I look forward to when I can address Stephen Parry as Mr President—even if I do not sing <span style="font-style:italic;">Happy Birthday, Mr President</span>—and I regret that I will not be here to enjoy the discipline of our new Chief Whip, Helen Kroger.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Very finally, I want to say that, even though it is fashionable to revile politicians and politics, the Senate provides an impor­tant institutional safeguard in the workings of our democratic system. I have come to appreciate that more and more the longer I have been here. The opportunity to shape and participate in public debate on matters of major national significance is not only a privilege; it comes with heavy obliga­tions. Criticism from time to time is inevitable, but it should not deter any senator from standing up where there is unfairness or injustice and advocating for the best interests of all Australians. This is important work and I shall miss it.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">In Winston Churchill's 1906 biography of Lord Randolph Churchill, he describes how his father, although initially reluctant to assume public office, came to keenly appreciate the importance of participation in public life. He said this:</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Small">It is easy for those who take no part in the public duties of citizenship under a democratic dispen­sation to sniff disdainfully at the methods of modern politics and to console themselves for a lack of influence upon the course of events by the indulgence of a fastidious refinement and a meticulous consistency. But it is a poor part to play.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I cannot but agree and I wish all senators well for the future.</span>

Senator Coonan has indicated the wish to depart this place without too much fanfare or valedictor­ies. The coalition respects that wish but cannot allow a former distinguished cabinet minister and a former Deputy Leader of the Government in the Senate to leave without a sincere expression of our appreciation and thanks for her commitment and service. We understand her reasons for leaving and respect them. We wish our valued colleague all the best for the future, good health and happiness. We also especially extend that wish to her husband. On behalf of all coalition colleagues, I thank the senator for her 15 years of service to the people of New South Wales, the nation and the Liberal Party. We salute you.</span>

                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Senator FAULKNER</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-State">New South Wales</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">17:52</span>):  I spoke yesterday in the chamber about the United Nations Convention relating to the Status of Refugees, an international treaty born out of the tragedy and bloodshed of the Second World War, and about the importance of the convention in providing protections and safeguards to so many who have been forced to flee from their homes and homelands. I said that as Australians we should be proud of our nation's role in the formulation of the convention, as we should be proud of our connection with the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, a treaty that celebrated its 60th anniversary three years ago and out of which the refugee convention grew. We should never forget that and we should never forget that article 14 of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights states:</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Small">Everyone has the right to seek and to enjoy in other countries asylum from persecution.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The Menzies government ratified and acceded to the refugee convention and enshrined into Australian law our commit­ment to some of the world's most vulnerable people.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Sixty years after the implementation of the convention, the international community continues to face enormous challenges in meeting the social, economic and human­itarian plight of refugees. Here in Australia we have largely been shielded from the global movement of refugees because of simple geography and the relative difficulty of arriving on our shores coupled with the very real danger of embarking on such a journey.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">In 2010 there were 358,800 applications for asylum in industrialised countries. Of those 358,800 applications for asylum, Australia received 8,250. As a matter of comparison, Sweden, a country with less than half Australia's population, received 31,800 applications. Canada received 23,200 applications and the United States received a staggering 55,530 applications. The UNHCR puts the total number of asylum seekers worldwide at 837,500. I think that these comparisons tell a story in themselves.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Australia has had its own history of refugee movements. Our first real experience with mass arrival by boat—and I use the word 'mass' advisedly given international comparisons—was with those fleeing the newly unified Vietnam after the Vietnam War. The first boat to reach our shores arrived in Darwin in April 1976. Over the next five years 2,059 Vietnamese people arrived on our shores. It is now often forgotten that by the mid-1980s Australia offered a home to another 90,000 people languishing in refugee camps across South-East Asia. When the Fraser government negotiated for the settlement of the Vietnamese people affected by the decade-long war, few would have predicted what a positive and profound effect these people would have on our national identity and what a valuable contribution they would make to Australian society.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The same is true of the Chinese citizens allowed to stay by the Hawke government following the Tiananmen Square massacre of 1989. Not only was this a recognition by the Australian government that Australia must play its part in the international community; it was a signal that we as a nation would not sit by as innocent people suffered for their beliefs and ideals, the very same beliefs and ideals that Australians enjoy and should never take for granted.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Sixty years is a long time. Many instruments and institutions of international law have come and gone over those decades. Few, however, have had the lasting effect of the refugee convention. Australia's role as an original signatory and ratifier is something I believe Australians should be very proud of. I hope that in this, the 60th year of the Geneva convention relating to the status of refugees, we can keep some of this history in mind, that we can keep in mind why the need for the refugee convention arose. An open mind should assist us to appreciate that, while circumstances now may be different to those faced by refugees after World War II, today's refugees are just as vulnerable as those Australia sought to help in previous decades.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The application of the United Nations Convention relating to the Status of Refugees to those who come to Australia is paramount. I for one will always stand up to argue Australian government policies must remain consistent with it. UNHCR Australia suggests that the refugee convention has helped over 50 million people restart their lives. This is an extraordinary achievement and one that I believe all nations involved should be proud of as we celebrate 60 years of the refugee convention.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">
                  <a href="KO6" type="MemberSpeech">
                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Senator HUMPHRIES</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-State">Australian Capital Territory</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">18:00</span>):  I rise tonight to return to an issue that was before the Senate earlier today, not so much to reprise argu­ments that were well ventilated at that time but to throw some important light on issues which may have been unclear or even confusing to senators involved in that debate. I am referring to the debate on Senator Brown's disallowance legislation with regard to the Northern Territory and the ACT. Senator Brown's bill was purportedly about preventing a Commonwealth minister from disallowing legislation of either the Northern Territory or the ACT by virtue of having signed an instrument of the Commonwealth. The effect of that legislation, as Senator Brown himself described, is quite straight­forward: to allow the territories to enjoy the same rights with respect to the passing of their laws which the states already enjoy. My party, the Liberal Party—the coalition—made it clear we objected to that because we believe that it was legislation which was undertaken in the absence of a compre­hensive assessment of what the needs were of the self-governing regimes of the two territories and was blind to many questions about the state of those regimes and how they need to be reformed systematically and not on a piecemeal basis. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I am particularly concerned about the fate of the amendment that was moved by Senator Brandis in the course of that debate during the committee stage. Senator Brandis moved an amendment which would have had the effect of saying that the power of the territories to enact laws was not provided for on the basis that the enactment was incon­sistent with the law of the Common­wealth. That was further illustrated by the sentence:</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Small">Without limiting the application of this subsection, the Assembly may not enact any law that is inconsistent with the Marriage Act 1961.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Senators will be aware that there has been heated debate about whether Senator Brown's legislation was some kind of stalking horse for enacting same-sex marriage legislation. Without canvassing whether that was or was not the purpose of Senator Brown's bill, the fact that the Senate chose to reject Senator Brandis's amendment to clarify that question is disturbing and leaves this question in some considerable doubt. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Aware that the comments of senators may be taken into account when interpreting legislation passed by the Senate, it is instructive to look at what Senator Brown himself had to say when this amendment was rejected. He said that Senator Brandis's amendments 'run totally contrary to the spirit of the legislation that is before the chamber'. He went on to say—in my view somewhat ominously:</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Small">I have explained that euthanasia is prohibited by legislation through this parliament, but the matter of marriage is not.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">It seems to me that Senator Brown was foreshadowing that it is not possible for a territory parliament to enact laws in respect of euthanasia because the federal parliament has expressly enacted that a territory parliament may not do that, but when it came to the question of marriage he drew a distinction and said that it is possible for a matter of marriage to be legislated for by a territory parliament. There is at least quite a respectable argument that the Commonwealth Marriage Act, particularly the amendments that were moved by the Howard government in 2004, leaves open the question of whether it is possible for a territory parliament to legislate with respect to the marriage of people of the same sex. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">That is an issue that has been canvassed by Professor George Williams. His argument is that the amendments moved in 2004 effectively characterise what may be done with respect to marriage between people of opposite genders but leaves open the question of what may be done with respect to the marriage of people of the same sex. As I understand it, he argues that it is possible for a territory law to be passed which provides for the marriage of people of the same sex because that is not covered by the legislation that was amended by the Commonwealth in 2004. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Senator Brown gave comfort to that interpretation by what he had to say about the situation of marriage and euthanasia being different. I would have thought that what Senator Brown said by those remarks in today's debate made it perfectly clear that he envisages the possibility of the question of marriage between people of the same sex being canvassed in legislation by the two territory parliaments. He acknowledges that that cannot happen with respect to euthanasia because that is expressly prohibited by legislation of this parliament, but he leaves open the question of whether marriage can be treated differently. With the greatest respect, I think the failure of the Senate to carry Senator Brandis's amendment does indeed leave that question wide open, and that concerns me enormously. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We do not know precisely and in much detail what the government's arguments were with respect to Senator Brandis's amend­ments, because, before the minister at the table—I think Senator Sherry—had an opportunity to put the government's position in the course of the debate about those amendments, Senator Brown moved that the debate be gagged, that the question be put immediately. So at that point in the debate there was no opportunity to put the argu­ment. I understand that Senator Sherry subsequently indicated that there had been an opinion from the Attorney-General on this question. It was obviously a very rushed opinion because it only arrived a few minutes after the actual amendment had been tabled by Senator Brandis. But if that opinion was dependent on the view that the Commonwealth covered the field with respect to marriage with its 2004 amend­ments, then it ought to be understood by honourable senators that that view is one that is probably not shared by eminent constitutional scholars such as Professor George Williams, who I think has argued that the Commonwealth did not effectively cover the field with its amendments in 2004. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">So I think it is more than fair to describe this question as being an open question. If it were to be the case that a territory parliament wished to return to this question and legislate in that respect, in an area where there was some considerable amount of grey—that is, where a civil union becomes a marriage—then, by virtue of the passage of the legislation which went through the Senate today, it would be easier for that to occur and harder for the Commonwealth to intervene to prevent that from being carried forward. If a territory parliament were to legislate for some kind of marriage, to use Senator Brown's words, it would not be possible for a federal minister to disallow that legislation by virtue of the stroke of a pen, as was the case before this legislation, before this amendment of Senator Brown. It would be necessary for the parliament as a whole to come together to overturn such legislation if it felt it was inconsistent with its own powers with respect to marriage. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I do not want to sound like a Cassandra, but I think it is important that this issue be addressed and I think, with great respect, we have not properly considered this matter in the course of today's debate and we need to come back and consider it properly. </span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-State">Tasmania</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">18:10</span>):  Tonight I wish to start by acknowledging that today, 18 August,  is Vietnam Veterans Day. This day pays tribute to all servicemen who fought and fell in the Vietnam War, and I call upon all here to remember them. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Recently I had the honour of attending the unveiling of the Anglesea Barracks peace­keeping memorial in Hobart, Tasmania. This much deserved memorial was unveiled on 29 May, International Day of United Nations Peacekeepers and the 63rd anniversary of the first peacekeeping operation authorised by the United Nations Security Council: the supervision of the truce after the 1948 Arab-Israeli war. Since 1947, the brave personnel of the Australian Defence Force have been involved in around 50 peacekeeping oper­ations, serving with distinction and honour. They have fought to build a better world for millions of men, women and children that have suffered oppression and vilification, violence and injustice. Most of these peace­keeping operations were conducted under the United Nations banner, while others still were under the British Commonwealth banner and others under regional bodies. Indeed, Australia's first peacekeeping oper­ation, in Yogyakarta in Indonesia in September 1947, predated the first United Nations peacekeeping operation. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Australia's peacekeeping missions have been to such nations and regions as Indo­nesia, Cyprus, Iran, Afghanistan, Western Sahara, Kuwait, Iraq, Cambodia, former Yugoslavia, Somalia, Mozambique, Rwanda, Haiti, Sierra Leone, Bougainville, the Solomon Islands and Zimbabwe, then named Rhodesia. At least 30,000 Australians have taken part in peacekeeping and humanitarian operations. These have included overseas emergency relief operations to Papua New Guinea, Sumatra, Pakistan, Iran and various Pacific nations.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">In addition to peacekeeping operations, Australians have also served in numerous warlike operations. The Australian Peace­keeper and Peacemaker Veterans Associ­ation describes these as 'peacemaking' operations. When both peacekeeping and peacemaking operations are taken into account, the number of ADF personnel who have served in the post-Vietnam era rises to almost 90,000. All of them selflessly risked their lives to help others and, tragically, some made the ultimate sacrifice.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Located in the grounds of Anglesea Barracks, the oldest Australian barracks still in use, the memorial is surrounded by other memorials to Tasmania's involvement in past conflicts: the sandstone monument to the 99th Regiment that left Tasmania to fight in the Maori wars, a pine tree planted by the last ANZAC, Alec Campbell, and the Korean war memorial, constructed from rocks transported back from Korea. While titled the 'Anglesea Barracks peacekeeping memorial', this memorial not only honours those that have served in peacekeeping operations but also recognises those that have served in peacemaking operations: the first Gulf War, Namibia, Somalia, Cambo­dia, Rwanda, East Timor, Afghanistan and Iraq.</span>
              </p>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">This memorial seeks to link all veterans of peacekeeping and peacemaking operations since 1975, whether they be defence, police, UN personnel or civilians who have served on defence operations. In this place, with these surroundings, it also links them to those that have served before them. It is a memorial in loose terms, in that while it commemorates those who have given their lives on UN or post-Vietnam operations it also serves to recognise the contributions and commitment of those serving on current and future operations. Tasmanians have a proud tradition of serving their nation through their involvement in the defence forces. Despite the small population base and the lower numbers of defence units, Tasmania still provides more recruits to the ADF per head of population than any other state. Mr President, I ask you to remember those, including Tasmanians Corporal Richard Atkinson, who was killed in Afghanistan earlier this year, and Captain Mark Bingley, who died in the Black Hawk crash off Fiji in 2006, who have given their lives in service of this country. Recently 16 Tasmanian reservists from three units returned from peacekeeping operations in the Solomon Islands. Other Tasmanian based members are currently deployed to Afghanistan, the Solomon Islands, Timor Leste and England. </span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The memorial itself was expertly designed and crafted by Geeveston sculptor Mr Bernie Tarr. He is a gifted Tasmanian artist, and Vietnam veteran, whose work utilises the beautiful timbers of Tasmania. Bernie's sculptures are now featuring in towns across Tasmania, but in particular in his home town, Geeveston, where they line Main Road. The memorial depicts a fearless Australian soldier rescuing a small child. While the soldier is armed, with a rifle slung over one shoulder, his arms enwrap the child, shielding it from harm. The statue was modelled on a 6th Battalion soldier on leave in Tasmania on compassionate grounds, following the loss of two of his counterparts in Afghanistan. Painstakingly chiselled from a slab of King Billy Pine by Bernie over a number of years, it reminds us of Australia's obligations to protect the vulnerable. It embodies Australians' sense of fairness and justice, of our natural tendency to defend the weak from injustice and oppression. The design was chosen by a committee which was headed by Major Tony Richings. This committee included representatives from the Returned and Services League, the Depart­ment of Veterans' Affairs, the Department of Defence and the Australian Peacekeeper and Peacemaker Veterans' Association, who looked over three submissions before choos­ing the design that is now in place. The Department of Defence provided outstanding assistance for this project. </span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The memorial unveiling was attended by the Governor of Tasmania, and my parliamentary colleagues Julie Collins MP, member for Franklin and Parliamentary Secretary for Community Services, and Andrew Wilkie MP, member for Denison, as well as the Tasmanian Minister for Veterans' Affairs, Scott Bacon MP. Perhaps more importantly, though, the memorial unveiling was attended by members of the 12th/40th Battalion, the Royal Tasmania Regiment, including its commanding officer Lieutenant Colonel Colin Riley, members of the Second Force Support Battalion, represented by Lieutenant Colonel Paul Grey, and members of the No. 29 Squadron, Navy Headquarters Tasmania, represented by Commander Steve Bliss. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">A number of organisations, departments and companies generously contributed, in various ways, to the construction of this memorial, and their generous contributions should be acknowledged. These include: the Naval Military and Air Force Club; Defence Health; Department of Defence; Returned and Services League Hobart sub-branch; Blackmore's Australia; Foxhole Medals; Anglesea Barracks Sergeants Mess; Anglesea Barracks Officers Mess; 12th/40th Battalion Regimental Trust Fund; Returned and Services League state branch; the Tasmanian state government; Delta FM; and the Department of Veterans' Affairs. </span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Tonight I would also like to recognise the work of the Australian Peacekeeper and Peacemaker Veterans Association. The APPVA is a non-profit veterans organisation that encompasses all peacekeeper and peacemaker operations that have involved Australian and New Zealand defence forces service men and women, federal and state police, philanthropic organisations such as Everyman's Welfare Service, Red Cross and the Salvation Army, and Defence civilians. It represents its members' interests, provides advice, promotes fellowship and raises the profile of its members' contribution to world peace and security. Its Tasmanian president, Lieutenant Colonel Phil Pyke; Tasmanian vice-president, Major Tony Richings; his wife, Sandy; and Colonel Mike Romalis need to be congratulated for the drive and dedication they showed over many years to get this memorial constructed. Thanks to their hard work and dedication, there is now a place for the younger veterans to com­memorate International Peacekeepers Day and the Australian Peacekeepers Day, held in September. It is a place for us all to remem­ber those Australians who have served, and are serving, with defence, police and the United Nations on peacekeeping and peacemaking operations around the world. It is also a place for us to give thanks for all that we owe them. </span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">

                  <a href="xt4" type="MemberSpeech">
                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Senator RONALDSON</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-State">Victoria</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">18:19</span>):  I would like to associate myself with the comments of Senator Bilyk and congratulate her on her speech. Earlier today I joined with Vietnam veterans and their families to participate in a national memorial service for Vietnam Veterans Day. The Leader of the Opposition and I jointly laid a wreath at the Australian Vietnam Forces National Memorial on Anzac Parade in honour of those who served, suffered and died as a result of the Vietnam War. The eighteenth of August each year is reserved as the day when Australians pay tribute to the service and sacrifice of 60,000 fellow Australians who served in the Vietnam War. Particularly we pay our respects to the memory of the 521 Australians who were killed in action during that conflict. Despite the rain and cold wind, the ceremony was well attended by dignitaries, including the Governor-General, the former Governor-General, the Prime Minister and minister, the Leader of the Opposition, who I have already mentioned, the Chief of the Defence Force, representatives of the service chiefs, ex-service leaders and representatives of the local ACT community. I was also honoured to be asked to attend the service in Melbourne at the Shrine of Remembrance, and I hope to do so next year.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Today is also significant because it marks 45 years since the Battle of Long Tan took place in a rubber plantation at Phuoc Tuy province in South Vietnam. On this day 45 years ago, 18 Australians were killed in action and 24 were wounded in action fighting an enemy which outnumbered the Australians 10 to one. The actions of D Company 6RAR will live on in history as one of Australia's greatest military victories. Today was not about glorifying that battle nor was it about glorifying the actions of the brave men of D6, as they are known. Rather it was an opportunity for this nation to reflect upon their service, remember their sacrifice and commemorate their deeds of extreme bravery and gallantry in the face of extra­ordinary danger. Today was all the more significant as it marked the day when the men of D6 were finally awarded their due honour by the Australian Army: a Unit Citation for Gallantry. I pay tribute tonight to the men of D6, their families and those who did not return home. Your service and sacrifice will not be forgotten. On behalf of the coalition—and I am sure I can speak on behalf of all senators—I extend to you our sincere thanks for a job well done. I also want to place on record my thanks and appreciation for the mothers and fathers, brothers and sisters, wives, girlfriends, husbands and boyfriends who support our currently serving defence personnel and our veterans.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Last Sunday I was honoured to be the guest speaker at the memorial service held by the Geelong and District Sub-Branch of the Vietnam Veterans Association of Austra­lia. The service was attended by almost 100 local veterans, their families and members of the local Geelong community. The weather in Geelong was superb for this ceremony and the camaraderie was tremendous. I once again thank the GDVVAA for extending me the great honour of being their guest speaker this year.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Small">Thank you very much, Mick. Ladies and gentlemen, a warm welcome, to Ken Baker, to parliamentary colleagues, to the Lieutenant Colonel, to the shire councillors and mayors. Can I just say at the outset thank you for the great honour that you have accorded me today to be asked to address this ceremony. Indeed, I hope to be in the Canberra or Melbourne ceremony next Thursday.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Small">I was going to mention a number of things which Ken mentioned this morning, and I will slightly change my speech.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Small">I look at this fantastic crowd today and I say to you that the ceremonies which will be occurring all over Australia, as they are, these ceremonies will be occurring with the knowledge, with the full knowledge, that the sacrifice that you veterans made must never, ever be forgotten.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Small">I say to you that to the eternal shame of this country, in those 15 years post the Vietnam War where there was no recognition, is a dark stain. It was unforgivable. I will talk about that stain and what we owe the young men and women returning from Afghanistan later on in my speech.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Small">It's probably not well known that close to the same number, the 60,000 men and women who served in Vietnam, have almost now served in Afghanistan. We as a community must never, ever, ever forget the mistakes of the past. I know that you've been asked, on behalf of this nation, to serve before and to sacrifice before. But I ask you again, to ensure that we make sure these young men and women returning from Afghanistan, some of who are on their fifth, sixth, seventh, eight, ninth and tenth rotations, that we look after them and we look after their families.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Small">I want to acknowledge another group of people who are here today, and that's the mothers and the fathers and the wives and the sisters and the brothers and the girlfriends and the boyfriends of those who served in Vietnam. Because sometimes it's all too easy to forget the contribution that they have made to this nation. They were the ones who we asked to pick up the lives of those who returned, many of whom were shattered. And we asked the wives and the girlfriends and the brothers and mothers and sisters to do what this nation should have done. We should only have asked you to be partner on that, not bearing the sole responsibility for that. For that I am deeply, deeply sorry.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Small">When these young men and women return, we must commit to making sure that the past mistakes are not repeated. They may not need the help on day one and day two - they probably will, but I suspect they won't acknowledge that. But when they are ready, then we must stand ready to provide them with the support that they deserve. I ask you, as I said before, to join that task because you, more than anyone else, understand what the commitment is required. You, more than anyone else, know what we need to do to ensure those mistakes are not repeated.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Small">I just want to say today that despite what happened and despite that stain on this nation's history, that we do thank you for your contribution. The nation demanded your attendance—apart from the Regular Army men and women—the nation demanded your attendance in Vietnam, and you went. And you served. We saw the extraordinary bravery which is epitomised at Long Tan. It was epitomised all over Vietnam. We look at the service of those in 6 RAR and say: why did it take so long for them to be recognised?. And we ask the question: on Thursday, despite the request of Harry Smith and the veteran community and people all over Australia, why, why, why is that Unit Citation for Gallantry not being given by the Governor-General in Canberra?</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Small">It should be in Canberra. Harry Smith, who I spoke to a couple of weeks ago, has been fighting the fight for that citation to be awarded by the Governor-General in Canberra where it should have been. It's not good enough, in my view, for those in Canberra to say that cost will determine where that award is made. This is far too important to be driven by cost and Harry Smith and those who wanted to attend from 6 RAR should have been flown to Canberra at the community's and the nation's expense, rather than it happening at Enoggera in Brisbane. That's all I will say about that, but I am pleased that the Governor-General will be awarding Harry and the rest of his colleagues at least at Enoggera next Thursday.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Small">Can I just leave now with the following? I look at those in front and I look at those who are serving this community, as members, as councillors and as mayors in local government, and I know those who are here today, including my parliamentary colleagues, will not forget your service to this country. We are extraordinarily grateful for what you have given us.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Small">It's because of you, and those who came before you, that we are the free and stable country that we are today. We will not forget your contri­butions and I thank you for allowing me the great honour to join you today. Ken, thank you most sincerely.</span>

                    <span class="HPS-MemberAnswer">Senator Chris Evans:</span>
                  </a>  The Minister for Defence has provided the following answer to the honourable senator's question:</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Small">During the period 1 July to 31 December 2010 Navy met its obligations to designated operations and other short term directed tasking. Navy is not required to and does not prepare all fleet units to the same operational level of readiness. To do so would be unnecessary, inefficient and costly. The preparedness of fleet units is maintained at an appropriate level to meet strategic guidance and ensure effective training throughput.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Small">Those fleet units held at higher readiness for short notice operational roles are appropriately manned, equipped and trained for the tasks that they might have to perform. Fleet units at other stages of the continuum will also be crewed in a manner that is best suited to their assigned tasking. This might mean the reduction in certain trained/skilled positions filled in order to make way for additional trainees. Fleet units invariably go to sea with all available accommodation filled.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Small">To meet and sustain operational, exercise, preparedness and training requirements, fleet units are operated in a cycle of scheduled maintenance, training and operational availability. Planned major maintenance activity periods are a routine element of the operational cycle. </span>

              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Small">(a) In general terms, when considering the contribution of Reserves or contractors to "combat capability" Defence will seek to maximise the strengths and capabilities of each particular element in order to meet the demands of operational force generation, sustainment and rotation requirements. Reserves and contractors will be utilised where most appropriate to ensure our combat capability meets national security requirements. Therefore, the immediate cost of combat capability is not necessarily reduced through the use of Reserves or Contractors. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Small">(b) There have been no 'one off' savings in relation to the use of reserves on operations for the period 1 July to 31 Dec 2010. In general terms a Reservist will cost more than a full-time soldier for the period of the deployment because a proportion of Reservists will have employers who are eligible for Employer Support Payments. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Small">For c<span style="color:gray;">ontracted service support, a</span>n assessment of a one-off saving can be made based on the following example of contracted aircraft support to Operation ASTUTE.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Small">A C130 is significantly more expensive to operate than a commercial aircraft, and consequently the ADF is using contracted service support to reduce costs for airlift in support of Operation ASTUTE (East Timor). A C130 costs approximately $14,000—$20,000 per hour (direct cost) to operate (depending on the C130 variant) and at any given time, the C130 fleet is heavily utilised within the ADF, with its air hour allocation apportioned across operations, exercises, training and contingency tasking. It takes approximately 17 hours flying time for a return task to Darwin, which includes positioning of the aircraft from RAAF Richmond to Darwin and return. The total cost of this exercise would be approximately $238,000- $340,000 per movement. Conversely, the cost of the current De Havilland Dash 8 contracted aircraft to conduct this task is approximately $29,000 per movement (Darwin to Dili and return). In this circumstance, and while the security situation in Dili allows, it is more cost effective to contract commercial airlift for this aspect of support for Operation ASTUTE.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Small">Results of tests carried out by the Australian Nuclear Science and Technology Organisation (ANSTO) on soil and dust samples taken from a variety of locations in Afghanistan, including Uruzgan, concluded that soil uranium levels were all within normal range. </span>
