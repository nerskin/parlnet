                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">

                      <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Senator RONALDSON</span>
                    </a> (<span class="HPS-State">Victoria</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">10:01</span>):  I rise to speak on the Veterans' Entitlements Amendment Bill 2011 and flag that I will be moving an amendment during the Committee of the Whole to omit schedule 2 from the bill. This bill seeks to do three things. Firstly, the bill establishes a prisoner of war recognition supplement—a POWR—of $500 per fortnight, which will be paid to around 900 eligible former prisoners of war. Secondly, the bill seeks to clarify arrangements concerning offsetting provi­sions under the Veterans' Entitlements Act 1986. I will speak in further detail about this schedule shortly. Finally, the third schedule of this bill rationalises the way temporary incapacity payments are made under the bill.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The coalition supports schedules 1 and 3 of the bill. Of course, schedule 1 of the bill builds on a similar initiative of the previous coalition government. The previous coalition government made one-off ex gratia payments of $25,000 to Australian ex-POWs. In 2001 these payments were made to former Japanese POWs, in 2003 to prisoners of the North Koreans and in 2007 to former captives of the Germans and Italians. Honourable senators will know of my close personal connection to the ex-POW com­munity in Australia through my involvement as co-chair of the Australian ex-prisoner of war memorial project in my home city of Ballarat. The coalition supports the supple­ment, which will be available to approxi­mately 900 POWs who are known to the Department of Veterans' Affairs. The first payment will be made on 6 October and the measure will be in place from 20 September this year. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Schedule 3 of this bill rationalises temporary incapacity payments under the Veterans' Entitlements Act 1986—the VEA. The changes abolish the payment of temporary incapacity allowance under the act, with those previously eligible for this payment being transferred to the loss of earnings allowance presently available under the VEA. The rationalisation of these pay­ments reflects the changing nature of Australian society. A stay in hospital and periods of convalescence can be much shorter now than in the past. The temporary incapacity allowance currently paid under the VEA requires an eligible veteran to be hospitalised or unable to work for a mini­mum period of 28 days. After 28 days the veteran is eligible to apply to receive an allowance, which is backdated to the first day of hospitalisation. The changes proposed by the amendment remove the 28-day qualification period and replace it with a pro rata loss of earnings allowance which compensates for an actual loss of earnings. The Parliamentary Library explains that the amount of loss of earnings allowance payable is the lesser of the difference between the T&amp;PI rate of disability pension and the veteran's present rate of disability pension and the amount of salary, wages or earnings actually lost, including loadings or other allowances that would have been payable. This is a sensible amendment which the coalition and the ex-service community support.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Schedule 2 of the bill has been the subject of a Senate inquiry and the coalition is opposed to it. Schedule 2 of the bill seeks to amend provisions in the Veterans' Entitlements Act 1986 to clarify the opera­tion of compensation offsetting provisions. Offsetting occurs when a person is eligible to receive compensation from two or more sep­arate Commonwealth compen­sation schemes for the same incapacity resulting from injury. Offsetting dates back to 1973 when the Whitlam Labor government determined to broaden the application of the former Repatriation Act to cover certain non-warlike service. As a consequence of this action, some eligible ex-defence personnel were able to access compensation under two acts—the Repatriation Act and the Compen­sation (Government Employees) Act 1971. The offsetting changes introduced in 1973 and backdated to 1972 were intended to apply to dual eligibility for compensation paid from Commonwealth compensation schemes. A vital premise of Australia's repatriation system is that the Common­wealth will compensate for incapacity, not for the injury itself. As a result, two people with the same injury may receive different rates of compensation based solely on the degree to which each person is incapacitated. The coalition supports this principle, as does the veteran and ex-service community.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I now turn to the Smith case. The amendments proposed by this schedule arise from a decision of the full Federal Court. In the matter of Commonwealth of Australia v Smith (2009), the court found that compen­sation offsetting should not apply to Mr Smith because of the unique circum­stances of his case. Mr Smith was receiving compen­sation under the VEA and the Safety, Rehabilitation and Compensation Act 1988 for two separate incapacities relating to separate periods of service in the Australian Defence Force. In the first instance, Mr Smith received compensation under the VEA for a duodenal ulcer and PTSD as a result of his service in Vietnam. Secondly, Mr Smith received compensation for anxiety arising from his service aboard HMAS <span style="font-style:italic;">Melbourne</span> at the time it collided with the <span style="font-style:italic;">Voyager</span>. The court held that these two conditions were not related and, on the basis of this fact, determined that offsetting should not apply under the act. I note the Commonwealth did not pursue this matter beyond the Federal Court. The Commonwealth argued that Mr Smith was being twice compensated for the same incapacity—a position the court disputed, holding that the injuries and resultant incapacities were different and separate. The court awarded a confidential settlement to Mr Smith and found in his favour. Consequently, the government is now seeking to clarify the legislation to make clear the Repatriation Commission's understanding of the intention of the legislation—and I use the word 'clarify' advisedly.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">At the coalition's request, a Senate inquiry into the bill sought submissions from the veteran and ex-service community. In particular, I thank the RSL, Legacy and the Vietnam Veterans Federation of Australia for their participation and the RSL for attending the public hearing in Canberra on 11 August. Three weeks ago, the report of the Senate Foreign Affairs, Defence and Trade Legislation Committee's inquiry into the bill was tabled in the Senate. My colleagues Senator Alan Eggleston and Senator David Fawcett tabled a dissenting report which calls for schedule 2 of the bill to be omitted. I thank both of my colleagues for their significant input into this inquiry.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">During the inquiry, the RSL forcefully put the view that the proposed amendments went above and beyond the intention of the 1973 legislation which the government allegedly seeks to clarify. Further, the RSL put the view that appropriate provisions already exist in the legislation and in accompanying regulations to ensure that offsetting cases similar to Mr Smith's would be treated fairly under the act. The department did not dispute the detail of the RSL's analysis. It was also made clear during the public hearing and in other representations to me on other matters that parliament must maintain the ability to set the policies by which the department, the Repatriation Commission and the Military Rehabilitation and Compensation Com­mission operate. In particular, I note Rear Admiral Doolan's statement:</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">… the RSL view is that it is much better to have the legislation being the basis for all these matters than to have it by regulation.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The coalition agrees with this and is concerned that these proposed amendments to, as the government claims, clarify the operation of the act will still require guidelines to ensure they are applied properly. Parliament's intention, rather than the department's, must be paramount in this respect. Parliament's original intention was sufficiently clear in this case. I will shortly move an amendment to omit schedule 2 from this bill. I ask honourable senators to consider the best interests of our veteran and ex-service community and support the coalition's amendment.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I understand that there may be some alterations to the explanatory memorandum to the bill. I do not know whether these are clarifications or what they are, but we are advised that there will be some alterations. I certainly have not seen the altered explan­atory memorandum and I do not know whether the minister on duty is able to nod her head to indicate whether or not this will be tabled. Obviously it would be an extraordinary situation were I to be starting my second reading speech in relation to this matter and it was being proposed to alter the explanatory memorandum. In fact it beggars belief that that would actually occur at this eleventh hour. So I am assuming that this will not be the case. I have not been advised by the minister's office or anyone else about it. We will wait and see. The amendments proposed in schedule 2 have not been justified and more work needs to be done before the parliament considers the measures presently opposed. The coalition will support schedules 1 and 3 of this bill but oppose schedule 2.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I will briefly address some other matters. I notice that my colleague Senator Fawcett has now entered the chamber and I will repeat the thanks I gave to him earlier for his significant involvement in the Senate inquiry and his very considerable input into it. The so-called winter recess has been an extraordinarily busy period. I want to thank the hundreds of veterans and ex-service­people, and their families, who I have met during my travels—everywhere from Albany to Geraldton in Western Australia, to Mackay, Townsville and Cairns in North Queensland, and from Sydney to Warrnam­bool, amongst other places. I look forward to spending more time on the road shortly and encourage people with an interest in veterans affairs to participate in the coalition's veterans forums which are being held right across the country. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The biggest issue I am hearing is the ongoing unfair, unjust and inequitable situation facing DFRDB superannuants as a result of the shameful decision by this place to oppose the coalition's fair indexation bill. Honourable senators will be only too aware of the anger in the community at the decision of Labor, the Greens and Senator Xenophon to block the coalition's fair indexation bill from passing on 16 June. Those opposite should hang their heads in shame for this shameful decision to oppose the bill.</span>
                </p>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I want to turn now to the Centenary of Anzac. There remains significant concern about the Gillard-Brown Labor government's failure to establish a budget for the Anzac Centenary commemorations, which are getting closer by the day. The coalition welcomes the appointment of Air Chief Marshall Angus Houston as chair of the new Anzac Centenary Advisory Board, but it is fair to say that Air Chief Marshall Houston is flying solo at the moment, with other members of the board yet to be announced or appointed. The elephant in the room, however, is the lack of funding certainty which is jeopardising the planning for commemoration in small towns and big cities right across Australia. The coalition welcomed the $250,000 announced for a scoping study for works in Albany's part of the centenary. Coincidentally, the minister chose to visit Albany the day before I was scheduled to speak at a business breakfast there about the Anzac Centenary itself—imitation is the best form of flattery. I welcome his belated and minor financial commitment to this project and look forward to seeing a real commitment of funds for the Anzac Interpretive Centre very soon Finally, I turn to advocacy funding. I draw the Senate's attention to the anger in the veteran and ex-service community about cuts to veterans' advocacy in the budget. The minister signed, just prior to travelling to France for the 95th anniversary com­memorations of the Battle of Frommelles, letters which dramatically slashed funding under the Building Excellence in Support and Training program, known as the BEST program, as well as the Veteran and Community Grants program. The BEST grant program was established by the previous government. The grants enable ex-service organisations to provide assistance to veterans, veterans' families, members of the Defence Force and their families. The grants assist volunteer veterans working in our community to assist those who have served our nation and are in need of assistance. These volunteers help veterans file claims for compensation. These volunteers touch base with our ageing veterans and war widows to ensure they do not become socially isolated. They provide help and support to those in our community who want to discuss their experiences with someone who understands what they have been through. Cutting this funding could not have come at a worse time. Frankly, this government has no mandate to cut funding to this program but, just as with the carbon tax, it is going to do it anyway.

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">How the government can justify cutting $8 million from veterans' advocacy funding but then spend $12 million advertising their carbon tax broken promise is beyond the comprehension of most in the veteran and wider Australian community. The decision to cut this funding, made without warning and without any consultation, will potentially and dramatically spell the end for ex-service organisations, which simply will not be able to survive. </span>

                    </a>  I am sorry to say that this situation is repeated right across the country. Over the last three months, I have had the honour to speak at RSL state branch congresses across Australia. In his remarks to at least three of these congresses, the minister has said that the number of veterans of the Afghanistan conflict will shortly equal the number of veterans who served in Vietnam. But the justification for these cuts is a 25 per cent decline in the veteran population—that is, a decline in the VEA veteran population, not in veterans making claims under the SRCA or the MRCA. </span>

Can someone tell me why on this matter, which has been on the books for two or three months, I am now getting an addendum to the explanatory memorandum 10 minutes after I have started speaking? What is going on with this government? What a disgrace! These amendments were circulated weeks ago. Everyone knows the urgency of getting these POW payments through. Yet here at the eleventh hour I am getting an addendum to the explanatory memorandum. How can this chamber possibly operate properly when the responsible shadow minister was not given a copy of this addendum to the explanatory memorandum? It is quite disgraceful. This is another example of a government which is in freefall, a govern­ment which is divided, a government which has lost control of the agenda and thinks it is appropriate to bring an addendum to an explanatory memorandum into this chamber when the debate has started. I will now go and have a look at this. I suspect it will not allay the fears of those who have been involved in this process—the RSL, the Vietnam veterans et cetera. <span style="font-style:italic;">(Time expired)</span></span>

                    </a> (<span class="HPS-State">South Australia</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">10:22</span>):  I rise to speak on the Veterans' Entitlements Amendment Bill 2011. This bill seeks to amend the Veterans' Entitlements Act 1986. The Veterans' Entitlements Act provides for the payment of pensions and other benefits to veterans and certain other persons and provides for medical and other support. The Australian Greens are of the view that, as a society, we send people off to serve on our behalf in situations which potentially place them at great risk. It is only fair then that we ensure we look after them properly when they return home. As an overriding principle, the Australian Greens support fair and equitable compensation, assistance and support for all veterans and their families. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This bill has three schedules. Schedule 1 seeks to create a prisoner of war recognition supplement. This will provide for certain veterans who have been held as prisoners of war to receive an additional supplement of $500 per fortnight in recognition of the severe hardship and deprivation they suffered during their incarceration. Schedule 2 seeks to clarify and affirm the original intention of the compensation offsetting policy in relation to pensions payable under the Veterans' Entitlements Act. The schedule aims to make clear that where compensation is paid from another source in respect of the same incapacity, though not necessarily the same injury or disease, as a pension which is paid under the act, compensation offsetting provisions will apply. The intention is to prevent double payment of compensation for the same incapacity. Schedule 3 seeks to rationalise the current temporary incapacity allowance and the loss of earnings allowance by abolishing the former, the temporary incapacity allowance, and replacing it with an entitlement to seek access to the loss of earnings allowance instead. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Schedule 1 is welcomed by the veterans communities and appears to be supported by all, and schedule 3 is relatively uncontro­versial. I will address these schedules briefly before focusing on schedule 2, which deals with offsetting and is more controversial and which has raised some concerns for the veterans communities and for the Australian Greens. These concerns were recognised by the Selection of Bills Committee, which, in recommending an inquiry into the provisions of the bill, focused on schedule 2, stating that the purpose for the inquiry would be 'to seek further information about the changes proposed by schedule 2 and to enable feedback from the veteran and ex-service community about the changes'. The bill was referred to the Senate Foreign Affairs, Defence and Trade Legislation Committee for inquiry, and I was pleased to participate in this inquiry as a committee member. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Under schedule 1, the proposed prisoner of war recognition supplement will be paid to veterans who were held as prisoners of war and to civilians alike who were interned as prisoners during World War II and the Korean War. Previous governments have made one-off ex gratia payments of $25,000 to former prisoners of war. In 2001, they were paid to those who were detained in Japan; in 2003, to those who had been detained in Korea; and in 2007, to those who were detained in Europe during World War II. The prisoner of war recognition supple­ment is proposed to be paid in addition to any existing Commonwealth benefits the eligible person receives. It will be exempt from income tax, exempt from calculations in assessing other veterans entitlements and exempt from social security income tests. The payment will be indexed annually in line with the consumer price index. The supple­ment is not a pension, nor is it compensation based on any test of incapacity or on the person having suffered a war caused injury or disease, and it will not be subject to the offsetting provisions of the act. It is purely in recognition of incarceration. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The Department of Veterans' Affairs estimates that up to 900 former civilian and veteran prisoners of war will be eligible for the supplement. Introduction of the supple­ment is overwhelmingly supported by the veterans community. It is appropriate that we acknowledge the unique and often traumatic circumstances that prisoners of war endured at this nation's behest. Neither one-off payments nor fortnightly supplements can possibly fully compensate for the experience of being held as a prisoner of war. But, as a society, we can make these gestures which may make life a little more comfortable for those who have endured so much and acknowledge the contribution these people have made on our behalf. The Australian Greens support schedule 1, the payment of a prisoner of war recognition supplement. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Schedule 3, the proposed rationalisation of the temporary incapacity allowance and the loss of earnings allowance, is a logical streamlining measure which will remove the overlap and confusion associated with two similar payments. This proposal elicited no major concerns from the veterans community or others during the committee's inquiry. The Australian Greens support schedule 3. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This brings me to schedule 2 of the bill. According to information from the Depart­ment of Veterans' Affairs, schedule 2 seeks to clarify compensation offsetting provisions. These provisions apply where a veteran receives compensation for two or more different injuries or illnesses which would result in the same incapacity. The provisions have been used since the early 1970s and schedule 2 seeks to clarify their application rather than to alter them or change when they are applied. Compensation offsetting rests on the principle that compensation is payable for a state of incapacity rather than for a specific injury. This amendment seeks to affirm and give clarity to the original intention of the existing legislation and to ensure the equitable outcome that a person cannot receive duplicate compensation for the same incapacity under different pieces of legislation. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Under the Veterans' Entitlements Act, pensions are payable for war or defence caused injury or disease. Pensions under part 2 of the act are payable to veterans, while pensions under part 4 are payable to current or former Defence Force members with certain peacetime service. The amendment in the bill seeks to ensure that a person cannot receive duplicate compensation for the same incapacity by providing that, if a person is receiving a pension under part 2 or part 4 of the Veterans' Entitlements Act and the person receives additional compensation from another source in respect of the incapacity or death for which the pension is being paid, the amount of Veterans' Entitlements Act pension is reduced—that is, offset on a dollar for dollar basis by the amount of additional compensation. Most cases involving compensation offsetting arise from duplicate entitlements under the Veterans' Entitlements Act and the Safety, Rehabilitation and Compensation Act and their predecessors, though compensation from other sources, including third party insurance and common law cases, may also be subject to compensation offsetting under the Veterans' Entitlements Act. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The stated reason for the introduction of the bill was to clarify the law after a 2009 Federal Court case, the Commonwealth of Australia v Smith (2009) FCAFC 175, after that case cast doubt on the way in which the department had previously interpreted the Veterans' Entitlements Act. The policy objective of the amendments was said to be to provide some certainty that the offsetting provisions in the Veterans' Entitlements Act could continue to be administered as they had been for nearly 40 years so as to prevent duplicate compensation being paid to veterans for the same incapacity. I was pleased to be a member of the Senate Foreign Affairs, Defence and Trade Legislation Committee for the purposes of inquiring into this bill. During this inquiry, concerns were raised by some members of the veterans community about this schedule, and the Australian Greens had some similar concerns. These can be summarised as: concerns that the schedule would extend the potential scope of offsetting, to the detriment of veterans; concerns about the consideration of legal costs in determining the value of compensation received; and concerns about the apparent discretionary nature in which offsetting provisions could be applied in the future. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I turn to the issue of legal costs first. During the inquiry, I was concerned to learn that, when considering what amount of compensation was received in order to determine what offsetting should occur, the Repatriation Commission allows for one type of legal cost to be subtracted from the lump sum but not another. So the costs which are described as party-party costs are able to be subtracted from a settlement figure and the net figure then used to offset. However, other costs commonly paid by a client to a legal adviser—called solicitor-client costs—are not subtracted. These solicitor-client costs reduce the amount of money actually recei­ved by the claimant for their own use. This was raised as a matter of concern by the Vietnam Veterans Federation of Australia and the Returned and Services League of Australia. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The Australian Greens are of the view that solicitor-client costs can often be quite significant and should not be ignored when the settlement figure for offsetting is being calculated. As Rear Admiral Doolan of the RSL said to the inquiry, the figure used for offsetting should be the amount actually paid into a person's bank account. This is only fair. The idea behind offsetting is that a person should not be compensated twice for the same incapacity. However, a person has not actually received that part of the compensation for their own use which has been paid to their lawyer as a legitimate cost of taking the legal action. So, it stands to reason that that part of the settlement should not be taken into account for the purposes of offsetting. The Australian Greens believe that solicitor-client costs should be subtracted from any settlement for the purposes of offsetting calculations. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The committee report notes that this is an area worthy of consideration by government, although it is beyond the scope of the current bill. I understand that there has been a recent extensive review of military compensation, that the government is yet to respond to the review and that further legislative changes are likely in due course as a response to this review. The Australian Greens wish to see the issue of solicitor-client costs addressed in the next amendment bill. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Of more immediate concern is the possibility, raised by the RSL and the VVFA—the Vietnam Veterans Federation of Australia—that the bill would lead to a situation where the Commonwealth could double dip into veterans' disability pensions and would change the system that has operated satisfactorily up to now. I took these concerns seriously, discussing them in more detail with the RSL and the VVFA after the inquiry was completed. While committed to the principle that offsetting was a sound practice in order to prevent a person being compensated more than once for the same incapacity, I was concerned that veterans should not be worse off, given the assurances that the government had offered that this legislation was not intended to do any more than affirm and clarify the situation as it is applied prior to the Smith case. </span>

                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">After discussions with a representative of the minister and senior members of the Department of Veterans' Affairs, I was pleased that the government had agreed to amend the explanatory memorandum attached to the bill to include a clear statement to the effect that the proposed amendments will not change the current operation of the compensation offsetting provisions, including the interaction between the provisions and chapter 19 of the <span style="font-style:italic;">Guide to the Assessment of Rates of Veterans' Pensions</span>, fifth edition—also known as GARP V. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This revised explanatory memorandum reads:</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">The proposed amendments will not change the current operation of the compensation offsetting provisions. The changes are intended to clarify the operation of the legislation following the Smith decision and ensure that the established compensation offsetting practices can continue. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The expansion to the explanatory memorandum clearly sets out the current practice in the use of GARP where there is an 'accepted' condition and a 'non-accepted' condition and the situation where GARP does not apply. In both cases the memor­andum explicitly states that the current practice will not change under the proposed amendments.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">There remained a concern, raised by the RSL and the Vietnam Veterans Federation of Australia in the inquiry and subsequently, about the discretionary nature of offsetting practice as it may be applied by the Repatriation Commission or decision makers into the future, notwithstanding what has happened in the past. Again, the Australian Greens took these concerns seriously and I am pleased that, after further discussions with the minister's representative and the department, the government has agreed to add a further paragraph to the explanatory memorandum as follows:</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">The Repatriation Commission will be issuing appropriate policy guidance to the Department of Veterans' Affairs staff to ensure offsetting occurs in line with the legislation and longstanding practice as outlined above. Ex-Service Organisations will be consulted during the development of this material. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">These statements, which will be on the public record, affirm the government's position that schedule 2 clarifies but does not change current offsetting arrangements. As such, the concerns of the Australian Greens about schedule 2 have been substantially addressed. In light of the revised explanatory memorandum, the Australian Greens now support schedule 2, meaning the Australian Greens support the Veterans' Entitlements Amendment Bill 2011, as proposed by the government, with one addition. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">On behalf of the Australian Greens, I will be co-sponsoring a second reading amendment to the bill with Senator Nick Xenophon requesting that the government undertake an examination of the cost of expanding the class of persons eligible for the repatriation health card for all conditions—known as a gold card—to include a person who is a nuclear test participant as defined in the Australian Participants in British Nuclear Tests (Treatment) Act 2006, and that such examination of the costing be completed within three months. Consideration of extending the gold card to British nuclear test participants is a matter of principle for the Australian Greens and has been previously proposed by my colleague Senator Scott Ludlam. Australian veterans were exposed to nuclear testing and radiation between 1952 and 1963 at Maralinga, Emu Field and the Montebello Islands. The Greens believe that, given these people were exposed to ionising radiation and the severe health impacts arising from this, they should be entitled to full comprehensive health care, in particular at gold card standard. Currently, British nuclear test participants do not have an automatic right to these entitlements. It seems to the Australian Greens that, given the recognition of the experiences and service of prisoners of war in schedule 1 of this bill, this is also an opportune time to request the government to investigate the costs of implementing this reform for British nuclear test veterans, who were also acting in service of their country. It would be a just and long overdue reform. I understand that, given the relatively small number of veterans involved, the costs would not be unduly prohibitive but I am happy to have this examined. Thus, the Australian Greens are happy to co-sponsor a second reading amendment.</span>

                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">
                    <a href="DYU" type="MemberSpeech">
                      <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Senator FAWCETT</span>
                    </a> (<span class="HPS-State">South Australia</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">10:37</span>):  I rise to speak on the Veterans' Entitlements Amendment Bill 2011 and note the contribution of Senator Ronaldson and our opposition to schedule 2. The bill gives effect to the following budget measures: a prisoner of war recognition supplement, some proposed compensation offsetting changes, and rationalisation of the temporary incapacity allowance and loss of earnings allowance.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I will touch briefly on schedules 1 and 3 and then come back to schedule 2. On schedule 2, I have a number of issues with both process and principle that I would like to address. With regard to schedule 1, since 2001 lump sum payments of $25,000 have been made to former prisoners of war, particularly prisoners of the Japanese during World War II. That was a well-justified initiative of the Howard government to recognise the conditions and privations that were put upon these people who served their country. In 2003, these were extended to former POWs of the North Koreans during the Korean War and were extended again in 2007 to former POWs interned in Europe during World War II.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The supplement is a $500 per fortnight payment, which I welcome on behalf of the veterans who have been prisoners of war and note that it is tax free and not offset. I believe that is the kind of precedent that we should be setting for all of our support for veterans, whereby we recognise the fact that they have provided a unique service to this country and therefore we should be prepared to provide unique support back to them, even if it is different to the way some other community payments are treated.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Schedule 3 of the bill is a rationalisation of the temporary incapacity allowance and loss of earnings allowance. I notice there will be some veterans who are affected by the wind back of TIA, but all of the veterans organisations that we consulted supported that rationalisation as providing better clarity around those provisions. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I wish to discuss schedule 2 in a little more detail. I particularly wish to thank members of the RSL who came to the inquiry of the Senate Foreign Affairs, Defence and Trade Legislation Committee, as well as Legacy and VVF, who provided submissions to help the committee looking at this provision understand how these proposed amendments could affect veterans and their concerns about them. One of the concerns that we raised in particular was about process. The Minister for Veterans Affairs made statements about the extensive consultation that had preceded these amendments and yet in our discussions, particularly with the RSL, it became abun­dantly clear that the consultation process in fact was not particularly broad. When it was boiled down, the specific consultation process with peak bodies such as the Returned and Services League consisted of a budget-eve briefing.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The common definition of consultation, as I understand it and as I think a reasonable person in the community would understand it, is a process whereby you engage with concerned parties, put forward a case, seek their feedback and, as appropriate, amend your position based on their feedback. To have a one-way flow of information on the eve of an announcement such that people have no chance, no opportunity, to influence or put forward their case or identify where the amendments may affect them and call it consultation is a real stretch. I believe that in light of the proposed amendments that the Australian Greens are talking about, where the government is promising to consult with the veterans community, we need to look at what it has done preceding this amendment bill and make sure that it is held to account to have meaningful consultation, which means consultation well ahead of the tabling of any changes that gives a real opportunity for people to consider the amendments and to make appropriate and studied responses to the amendments.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I move to the issue of principle. The RSL raised the point that it is very happy with the way the current offsetting provisions work. It accepts the need for offsetting but it also maintains essentially that if it is not broken then don't try to fix it. DVA promises that these amendments will make no change and will have no impact on veterans, which raises the question—particularly given that the Federal Court indicated that the Smith case was unique and DVA is not able to identify anyone else who falls within the same category—as to why the changes are needed. The RSL in particular highlighted that it believes that the <span style="font-style:italic;">Guide to the Assessment of Rates of Veterans' Pensions</span>, fifth edition, the GARP V, is adequate and addresses the situations where there needs to be some offsetting or pro rata allocation for a combination of injuries that have led to an incapacity.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Coming to the principle of offsetting: as I said, none of the veterans organisations disputed the need for offsetting. If you go back to 1973, when the principle first started to appear in legislation, there was an overlap between the Repatriation Act, the predecessor to VEA, and the Commonwealth Compensation Act 1971, which gave rise to a situation where some people had dual eligibility. It was very clear that there were two Commonwealth schemes under which people could possibly have a dual eligibility. So the concept was that nobody should be compensated twice by the Commonwealth for an injury that was received during their service. I do not think anyone has concerns with that. What has changed, though, is that the understanding that the offsetting should be between two Commonwealth sources of compensation has been extended so that any source of compensation is included We see this in both the explanatory memorandum and the DVA submission. In fact, DVA highlighted that some 20 per cent of the offsetting cases they are dealing with are not from Commonwealth sources but from sources such as civil claims and other sources of compensation. There is a flawed principle in the application of this amend­ment and the way the department has administered offsetting since it was intro­duced in 1973. If the principle was to make sure that the Commonwealth was not liable twice for one injury, that would be fine. But when you extend that to other sources of income then you start abrogating the duty of care that the Commonwealth has to people who have served this nation. It is important to remember that loyalty flows two ways.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">If we expect people to enlist in the armed forces and to be prepared to put their lives, their welfare and their health on the line in the interests of this nation then we should be prepared to return that loyalty to them when they return. If they have been injured, including in the course of their duties during non-war related activities, we have an obligation to care for them. The fact that they may have another injury which was caused during a civilian accident and which happens to affect the same incapacity does not remove the obligation of the Commonwealth to care for those people who have rendered that service to their nation.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This concept of the duty of care is longstanding. Going back to the 1500s, Elizabeth I instructed parishes in England that they needed to care for returned servicemen. During the Napoleonic wars the British government came up with the concept of the 'deserving poor', recognising that people who returned and who were incapacitated as a result of their service to their country deserved the care of the people of that country. In contemporary Britain—and I use the example of Britain because of the links to the Westminster system—as recently as the last decade there has been the concept of a covenant between the British people, their government and the military.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This covenant has two facets. One is that if the government is going to deploy service men and women then they have a duty to make sure that those men and women are adequately equipped, trained and supported in the theatre of war. Likewise, there is that obligation post service to provide adequate care. I do not believe that the Australian public expects or would support the principle that the Commonwealth should be able to shift that duty of care to a third party just because a veteran has had civilian compen­sation payable for an injury. If a veteran has signed up to the service and the service has promised to provide for them then that obligation continues. If the veteran has a civilian injury, that is a separate issue. Speaking to people in the service and even to people working within the Repatriation Commission, I have noted their surprise in hearing that offsetting would be allowed for things other than dual Commonwealth entitlement. I believe that is something we need to address as a parliament.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The second facet of this covenant relates to the costs that are considered as part of the offsetting arrangement. Currently if somebody seeks compensation because of an injury then not only does the government take into account the civilian costs—and I dispute that principle—but it does it in a way that I believe is quite unfair. Whilst DVA recognises the party-to-party costs it does not recognise or discount the solicitor-client costs. That means that if a veteran receives, for example, $30,000 but $10,000 of that is taken up with costs to their solicitor then, rather than recognising that they received only $20,000, DVA treats the whole $30,000 as being compensation received by the veteran and offset appropriately or accord­ingly. Again, I do not believe a reasonable member of the public would expect that our government should be short changing veterans who had to incur that cost in order to win that compensation in the first place.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">To my mind, the government is not only going against the principle of two-way loyalty—of having a duty of care to veterans—by including that civil payment. It is  doing it in a manner that is unjustifiable. When questioned on this during the inquiry, DVA's position was that the offsetting or discounting of the solicitor-client costs was in line with community norms. Again, I come back to the principle that we are expecting people who sign up to serve in the Australian Defence Force to do things that are not expected of the broader community. If we expect that loyalty from them, we should show that loyalty back to them. We should show them that when things like this come up we are prepared to deviate from the community or civilian norm so that we do not disadvantage the veterans in our community.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The RSL also expressed during this inquiry its concern about the long-term changes of the offsetting provisions. The military, in a very welcome move, has in­creased the amount of rehabilitation available to servicemen. Rather than dis­charging them on a medical basis, there is an increased focus on rehabilitation. The question was raised—and was not particularly satisfactorily answered by the department—as to the long-term conse­quences of the costs of rehabilitation and how they may be offset in future years. I note particularly that the concept of offsetting between Commonwealth funds has now crept, without any legislative guidance, to include any source of compensation. The RSL raised the concern that, over time, the way people apply legislation can change and will often change to the detriment of the veteran.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">So a number of new factors are starting to come into this whole space, where we see an increase in money spent by the Com­monwealth on rehabilitation—and very appropriately. The question remained open, at the end of the inquiry, as to whether there was any guarantee that there would not be a detriment in years to come to veterans who had received payment from the Common­wealth for rehabilitation services to enable them to continue their service. So, all in all, we have an amendment here that the depart­ment itself says will have no effect. It cannot identify other people who fall into the case of Mr Smith, whose court case led to this amendment. It is proposing to spend some $2.7 million implementing an amendment it has said will have no practical effect. The ex-service community oppose the amendment and I believe there is no cause for us to support this amendment.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Whilst I commend Senator Wright for her active role and for engaging with the government, it seems to be indicative of the coalition that has now been formed between the government and the Greens in that they were fully informed about the changes to the explanatory memorandum and yet it was only delivered to the opposition shadow spokesperson for this important portfolio when he was 10 minutes into his second reading debate speech. I believe it is a particularly poor effort on behalf of the government to treat their coalition partner differently to the way they would treat the opposition in this important area. It is not the first time they have worked together and, like Senator Ronaldson, I note and want to record my deep disappointment that the Greens, the ALP and Senator Xenophon joined together to defeat the bill that would have addressed the indexation of the DFRDB.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I also note, again coming back to the lack of consultation, that this government has, without consultation, reduced funding for things like veteran advocacy funding, an important part that enables volunteers within our service organisations to work with people who need advocates. The funding provides them with the training and support that enables them to do an important role. If there is one thing I have seen from my involvement in public life it is that government policy is one thing, but it is the people on the ground, those who have the relationships and the connections to encourage and walk with people through the process to connect them to the benefits that are available from policy, who actually make a difference. Policy by itself does very little. No matter how dedicated public servants in the departments are, they do not have the relationships with people in the community. So it is often these voluntary roles that are really the effective connecting and coordinating bodies, and to cut their funding arbitrarily and without consultation is, I believe, a particularly poor step on the part of this government. It shows a great disrespect for our veterans community and the work they do.</span>

                    </a> (<span class="HPS-State">South Australia</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">10:55</span>):  I indicate that I will be supporting the second reading of the Veterans’ Entitlements Amendment Bill 2011, but I reserve my position in relation to schedule 2 of this amendment. I agree with Senator Ronaldson that it is quite unsatisfactory that an amended explanatory memorandum was provided some 10 minutes into Senator Ronaldson's speech on the second reading in relation to this. I am not ascribing blame. I understand from my brief discussion with Senator Wright from the Australian Greens that there were discussions and negotiations with the government last week. That is why there has been a late development in this, in the sense that an amended explanatory memorandum, in relation to schedule 2 of this bill, has been provided. It is important that that explanatory memorandum be thoroughly scrutinised in the committee stage to ensure that the matters raised by the coalition have been dealt with adequately. I will speak about that shortly in relation to that particular schedule and the potential impact it can have on veterans' entitlements.</span>

                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">It would be appropriate for me to raise at the outset, however, the comments made by both Senators Fawcett and Ronaldson on my position with respect to the indexation of veterans' superannuation entitlements. It was a controversial bill and it is a controversial issue. On that particular coalition private senator's bill, which I voted with the Australian Greens and the government to defeat, I voted with a great deal of caution and reluctance, but I made it very clear at that stage that I thought it was important that there be a re-think of this once the review being undertaken by the defence minister, and by a Senate committee, on the Defence Materiel Organisation hands down its findings. Clearly, the potential fiscal implications of that bill were quite significant—in the hundreds of millions if not billions of dollars. That in itself is not a reason not to proceed with legislation, but given the disparity between what the coalition said it would cost and what the government said it would cost and given that this has huge long-term implications in terms of superannuation entitlements, I thought it was appropriate that we find savings from the Defence Materiel Organisation and from Defence generally in order to ensure that there is a long-term sustainable method of superannuation indexation for those who have served.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I also made it clear when I spoke at the time that I thought there would always be an issue with those who have been injured while serving their country and for the family members who have lost a loved one in the service of their country, and that ought to be a priority. I do not think there is any dispute about that in terms of a limited pool of resources for that. That is something I will allude to in the context of this contribution. I want to make that clear to the veterans community, for whom I have enormous respect. I pay tribute to Barry Heffernan, with whom I have worked closely—he works with the Vietnam Veterans Associa­tion in South Australia—for the work we have done together. That just reminded me that this morning I need to return Mr Heffernan's call from the weekend.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">But it is important that we put this into perspective. The matter of superannuation entitlements is not over. It should be pointed out, not as a criticism but as a matter of historical record, that the coalition in their time in office did not deal with the issue of indexation. They opposed it. And it is fair to say that there are some in the coalition who were concerned about the budgetary implications of that and did not oppose it in the party room. But the party room has prevailed and is saying that this is the path they are going. I note that it will be coalition policy to take this to the people at the next election, as they are well entitled to do. So the door has not closed in relation to that and I am hoping that in the next few months we will get satisfactory answers in relation to savings from defence materiel and the long-term implications of such a move as proposed by the coalition so that we can have a good outcome for our veterans, not forgetting those who have served our nation, those who have been injured or maimed, who deserve every possible support—and improved support.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">That brings me to the bill and a second reading amendment that I will move shortly. This bill contains three specific aspects. Schedule 1 creates the prisoner of war recognition supplement. That is entirely appropriate and I strongly support those measures. I note that Senator Wright, in her contribution, referred to the enormous sacrifice that our prisoners of war have made, the privations they endured. I note that Australian governments of the past have given an additional payment of $2,500 to prisoners of war under Japanese occupation during World War II. That is entirely appropriate. This goes further, in that it provides ongoing benefits to our prisoner of war veterans, and I strongly support that. I cannot imagine what all prisoners of war went through; some in particular went through horrors that cannot be described. I commend the government for going down this path and the coalition for supporting it.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I will talk about schedule 2 in a minute, because it is not a contentious one. It rationalises the temporary incapacity allowance and loss of earnings allowance through the abolition of the temporary incapacity allowance with effect from 20 September 2011. Thereafter, veterans will be entitled to seek access to the loss of earnings allowance. That, too, seems not to be contentious. It is something that the coalition and the government support and it seems to be a necessary technical change to ensure a fairer outcome in relation to the temporary incapacity allowance.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">However, it is schedule 3 that is troublesome. It is intended to prevent, the government says, double payments of compensation for the same incapacity. It is an amendment that has come about as a result of a court decision in the matter of Mr Smith. That was a significant decision. It was a decision handed down at the end of 2009. The Commonwealth and David Ronald Smith was a case which looked at the interpretation of section 30C of the VEA in respect of incapacity from an injury. I think Senator Ronaldson well set out the details of that case involving Mr Smith's circumstances and the decision, and I do not propose to restate that.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The question is whether the government has overreacted in moving these amendments in response to the Smith case. The question is whether these amendments will have a number of unintended consequences, whether they will give too much discretion to the department, whether there can be circumstances in which veterans will miss out on just compensation and on their just entitlements as a result of these amendments, whether we are in fact giving too much power to the department and whether we are creating more legal uncertainty. Even though I am a lawyer by training, I would not want these amendments to lead to a lawyers picnic. I think that is something we need to be very mindful of. The committee stage of this bill will be critical in determining whether the addendum to the explanatory memorandum—a result of negotiations between the government and Senator Wright from the Australian Greens, and I commend her for her diligence in relation to this—will do what it is intended to do and whether it will fix the problem that the RSL have quite rightly pointed out is a significant issue for them.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">My question to Senator Ronaldson in the course of the committee stage will be, given that he was handed the explanatory memorandum 10 minutes into his speech, which is less than satisfactory, whether he has heard from the RSL at such short notice as to what their attitude is and whether their position is in any way different as a result of this addendum to the explanatory memor­andum. That is a key issue. It may well be that the RSL have not had an opportunity to properly digest this, and you cannot blame them for that given what has occurred. I think it is important that we do not rush this, that we do not ram this bill through. It is important that we hear from key veterans organisations and from the Returned and Services League in particular, given their input into the bill process.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">There is another issue, though, that needs to be dealt with. It is appropriate, I believe, in the context of this bill, in the context of veterans' entitlements, to deal with the issue of Maralinga, to deal with the issue of nuclear test veterans in this country and the shameful way they have been treated over many years. In the 2010-11 budget I was pleased with the government's recognition of British veterans' services as non-warlike but hazardous, which meant that those who served between 1952 and 1967 at the British atomic weapons detonation test sites of Emu Field and Maralinga in South Australia and the Montebello Islands off the west coast of Western Australia would have greater access to health services. Over 17,000 Australian soldiers and civilians were directly involved in the tests and assessment of the fallout from the nuclear tests across these sites.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">These tests were conducted to enable the United Kingdom to develop nuclear fission bombs and, later, nuclear fusion or hydrogen bombs, and were carried out with the full cooperation of the Australian government of the time. Sadly, many of these Australians have gone on to suffer a range of illnesses as a result of dangerous and continued exposure to high levels of radiation, from cancers to genetic diseases inherited by their children. Many of them have died as a direct result of this exposure to radiation. There are only around 2,000 survivors left and they are whittling away on a weekly basis.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">In the 2010-11 budget, the government set aside $24.2 million over five years so that participants would have their claims to veterans' entitlements, such as the disability pension and healthcare cards, assessed under the more generous 'reasonable hypothesis' standard of proof under the new expansion to the class of persons eligible. However, my understanding is that very little of these funds have been accessed because the standard of proof remains too high for those suffering illnesses as a result of nuclear test service. In May 2007, Professor Al Rowland from Massey University in New Zealand published a scientific paper on chromosome damage that provided hard evidence of the relationship between exposure to the ionising radiation from atomic blasts and certain cancers and birth defects.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I have been contacted about this issue by many who have been affected for some time. I have spoken with many veterans, including Peter Patterson, a retired canon of the Anglican Church, who contacted me after his applications for a gold card and disability pension were denied. Mr Patterson was commissioned by the Australian Military Forces to serve at Maralinga, South Aust­ralia, for a period of 87 weeks between 1956 and 1963 as an Anglican chaplain. Mr Patterson has told me that he has suffered from prostate and skin cancer during his life as well as from psoriatic arthropathy, a debilitating chronic arthritis condition which causes the inflammation of all joints. It is incredibly painful and debilitating. However, Mr Patterson's claim for a disability pension was rejected on the grounds that the delegate of the Repatriation Commission was not satisfied beyond a reasonable doubt that the psoriatic arthropathy was related to service.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I have also spent time with Geoffrey Gates, who was 23 years old when he served at Maralinga with the Air Force. He arrived in the middle of 1961, just after the two major bombs had been tested. During his 12 months at the base, tests on smaller nuclear weapons were continuing as well as assessment of the fallout from the bombs. Geoff has survived a brain tumour and both his son and grandson suffer bipolar disease.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Some veterans have told me about how they did nothing more than turn their backs for mere moments before turning around to watch the aftermath of the explosion. That was the modus operandi back then. That was how it was done. There was a complete lack of duty of care to our nuclear test veterans. Despite this, despite the fact that we know that service men had no protective clothing, despite the fact that they were literally rained on with nuclear fallout, I am aware of applicants who have been knocked back for a gold card because the department has determined they were not exposed to harmful amounts of radiation.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I welcomed last year's budget announce­ment that the participation of British nuclear test participants would be considered as non-warlike hazardous. This was welcomed by the veteran community. But it seems it means almost nothing because what they really need is access to health services and, under the current rules, sadly, virtually nothing has changed.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I have this morning circulated an amendment that will be dealt with by the committee to expand the class of persons eligible to receive the gold card to include British nuclear test participants. The simple fact is that the standard of proof required is too high given nuclear radiation is unable to be so directly proven after the time that has elapsed. But what can be proven is that these veterans were exposed to nuclear radiation in circumstances where there was a lack of care and respect shown for those veterans who were there being exposed to nuclear radiation. How is it that we sent young men and women to participate in nuclear testing, to observe the mushroom cloud and to clean up the fallout and to this day do not recognise the very serious impacts it has had on their health and the health of their children and grandchildren? This amendment will ensure that those British nuclear test participants will automatically receive the gold card. It should be that simple.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">However, I am aware that the government and the opposition may not support that and that they are concerned about the potential cost implications. I see the cost implications here as being quite distinct from the cost implications in relation to the issue of superannuation. I indicated just a few moments ago and at other times since that vote in June on the superannuation issue that I am open for there to be reform. I am open for there to be an improvement in the superannuation benefits. But here is a case where people need access to health care. It ought to be a right for those British nuclear test veterans.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I, and also on behalf of Senator Wright move:</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">At the end of the motion, add "but that the Government undertake an examination of the cost of expanding the class of persons eligible for the Repatriation Heath Card—For All Conditions (Gold Card) to include a person who is a nuclear test participant (within the meaning of the <span style="font-style:italic;">Australian Participants in British Nuclear Tests (Treatment) Act 2006</span>), and that such examination be completed within 3 months".</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This is a second reading amendment to ensure that the government will conduct a cost review within the next three months on expanding the eligibility of the gold card to nuclear test participants. I am hopeful that both the government and the coalition will support that. I am hopeful that that will at least be a way forward for those who are reluctant to support my amendment. At least there will be an acknowledgement and some mechanism to deal with the costing of this so that those remaining British nuclear test veterans can have access to the health care that they deserve.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The contentious part of this bill will be schedule 2. Let us wait and see whether the addendum to the explanatory memorandum deals with those concerns. I have yet to be convinced. I think, again, that the protests of Senator Ronaldson that he received it halfway through his speech in the second reading debate are completely justified. I hope that the government will give time to allow key veterans organisations—in particular, the RSL—to provide commentary about the addendum to the explanatory memorandum, because at this stage I am not convinced that schedule 2 ought to be passed. I am not convinced that the govern­ment's reaction to the Smith decision is a justified one. But I also urge my colleagues to, at the very least, consider opening the way forward for nuclear test veterans in this country to receive the medical care that they so desperately deserve.</span>

                    </a> (<span class="HPS-State">Queensland</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">11:14</span>):  I am very pleased to take part in this debate on the Veterans’ Entitlements Amendment Bill 2011 and to support any bill that supports our veterans. I am pleased to note that the coalition will be supporting, as I will be, the bill insofar as schedules 1 and 3 are concerned. I am very interested to be following Senator Xenophon in this debate and will be interested to have a look at the amendment he has proposed. I wonder if he has some costings for that amendment. I have to say to Senator Xenophon that it is perhaps too little too late. We really needed your support a few months ago during the indexation debate.</span>

You had your own reasons for not supporting us, which was a bit disappointing, but I am pleased to see that you are supporting those parts of this bill which will improve the benefits we give to our veterans.</span>

                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I will come back the provisions of the bill, but I would just indicate how much our nation owes the veterans—those people who have defended our country in times gone by. What our veterans have done is fresh in my mind from a ceremony I attended yesterday morning in Townsville marking the 60th anniversary of national service. The dawn service yesterday, on the shores of Rowes Bay in Townsville, was a very moving service. It and the parade later in the day were the culmination of a week of activities, during which national serviceman got together in Townsville for this magnificent 60th anniversary celebration, celebrating those who were called up for national service from 1951 onwards and served in the Korean conflict and of course in Vietnam. It was tremendous to see the veterans together, renewing acquaintances, telling lots of stories and remembering friends and colleagues who paid the ultimate sacrifice.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The dawn service in Townsville, which is of course as senators would know classed, or we class it ourselves, as a garrison city. It is the home of Lavarack army barracks, one of the biggest army barracks in Australia, and of course RAAF Base Townsville, formerly Garbutt, which is a very significant RAAF base. A lot of veterans who have served in those services have retired to Townsville, so it is a community, a city, that very much values the work of our servicemen, including our national servicemen. Yesterday's ceremony was really a very moving service. The master of ceremonies was Mr Ben Hobson and the services were led by padre John Emerson. I particularly mention Brigadier Neil Weekes, retired, who has been a tower of strength to veterans over the years since he retired from active service in the army. Brigadier Weekes was a national serviceman himself—he was called up for the Vietnam War—so , many years ago. He later joined the regular army and rose through the ranks to become a brigadier by the time of his retirement. Brigadier Weekes gave a very moving tribute at the dawn service yesterday.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The dawn service was followed by a parade down the new Flinders Street. The veterans who participated were still sprightly—most of them were still in step. It was determined, probably not by them, that some veterans from the Korean conflict should travel in old Willys jeeps and other veteran army vehicles at the head of the parade. Of course, the Townsville regular army band provided the music for the march. The salute was taken by the Deputy Mayor of Townsville, Councillor David Crisafulli, and by Brigadier Stuart Smith, the current CO of Lavarack Barracks. It was a magnificent affair. It brought to mind, as Brigadier Weekes mentioned in his speech, some of the difficulties that some of the veterans of the Vietnam War lived through. The Whitlam government's treatment of veterans on their return from Vietnam is to its eternal shame. As I always say, and as many acknowledge, the decision to go to war in Vietnam was a political decision that a good 40 per cent plus of Australians did not agree with. That was no excuse for taking it out on the veterans when they returned. It was a quite despicable period in Australian history when those troops returning from Vietnam, after fighting for their country at the government's direction, were spat at and condemned and were shunned, even by family.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Brigadier Weekes gave a telling story yesterday. He mentioned that, in the walk of remembrance at Enoggera barracks, where all of those who were killed in Vietnam had a tree planted and a plaque placed, one soldier from Brigadier Weekes' platoon was not named and was not recognised. That is because his family was so totally opposed to the Vietnam War that they refused to put up the money to provide for the plaque and also refused to have their son's body returned to Australia. That is how hard the feelings were and how divided the nation was. I accept that there was a political division, but it does seem very sad and very unfortunate that the death of this soldier—who, as Brigadier Weekes mentioned, was over 21 and made his own decision to go to war in Vietnam to fight for his country—was not recognised through the placement of a plaque. We also heard of a similar incidence in which a family who did not agree with the Vietnam War do not want their son's name recorded on a plaque at the Australian War Memorial. There is space left for his name, but family members still refuse to have his service in Vietnam recognised. Perhaps they have their reasons. It just seems sad that Australians at the time could not distinguish the political element of that war from the magnificent service of veterans, in this case veterans who were national servicemen.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Notwithstanding that, it was a magnificent week in Townsville, with a lot of activity. The dawn service was certainly very moving. I congratulate the Townsville City Council on the naming of the park on the shores of Rowes Bay, where the national service memorial was constructed a few years ago. Yesterday, following the dawn service, the park was dedicated as National Service Park. The unveiling was conducted by Councillor Deanne Bell on behalf of the Townsville City Council, Mr Warren Hegarty on behalf of the National Servicemen's Association and Brigadier Smith, the current CO of Lavarack Barracks, as I have mentioned. </span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I congratulate Warren Hegarty and his team on a fabulous week recognising the national service given by so many Australians over so many years. I know Mr Hegarty and his team have been working very hard for years now to ensure that the of 60th anniversary celebration would go off without a hitch, and they certainly succeeded in that. It was a great credit to them and a great recognition of the service of so many young Australian national servicemen to their country over the past 60 years.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I want to comment on the matters that Senator Xenophon raised about Maralinga. I have only recently seen his amendments, and Senator Ronaldson will no doubt deal with those in the Committee of the Whole. If Senator Xenophon is embarking upon this process, perhaps some investigation should be made into disabilities suffered by children of veterans who worked at Maralinga at the time of the atomic and nuclear test research. A constituent in of mine in Townsville has certain deformities which medical advice has suggested to her are the result of radiation that her father would have received during his service at Maralinga, prior to her conception. Clearly the department and governments should look at causal effects and costs and ensure that appropriate consideration is given in this area. I think this area should be looked at a little further. I have raised it at estimates hearings and have written to the minister about it. Perhaps it is something that Senator Xenophon might have considered. I hasten to add that, having only just seen his amendments and having only briefly heard him speak, I have not thought the matter through completely. I am sure that Senator Ronaldson, on behalf of the coalition, will have looked at this a bit more closely and will be able to indicate the areas in which the coalition perhaps does not agree. Clearly there is a need to look at this matter to see whether any harm may have been caused to Australian servicemen and perhaps their offspring as a result of service performed at Maralinga. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I am pleased that the coalition will be supporting schedules 1 and 3 of the bill before us. I will not go into those schedules in any great detail as I am conscious that Senator Ronaldson and other coalition speakers have done so. Suffice to say that, in relation to schedule 2, I am persuaded by the evidence given by Rear Admiral Doolan, head of the RSL, during the Senate inquiry into this bill, where he said: </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">… the RSL view is that it is much better to have the legislation being the basis for all these matters than to have it by regulation.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal"> I agree with that sentiment. I am concerned that, under the amendments proposed to schedule 2 to clarify the operation of the act, there will still be a requirement for guidelines by regulation or by departmental decree to ensure that they are properly applied. I thought I heard the Greens say in their contribution to this debate that they were now satisfied, because of an explana­tory memorandum, that all would be well. Under the Acts Interpretation Act, explana­tory memorandums can have some influence on the way legislation and regulation are administered. It would seem to me that if the parliament's intention can be written into an explanatory memorandum it can just as easily be included in the legislation. So, I am concerned about schedule 2. Senator Ronaldson has indicated that he will be moving an amendment to omit schedule 2, and the coalition is doing that in the best interests of our veteran and ex-service community. I certainly urge the Senate to support that amendment.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">In conclusion, I congratulate our veterans for all the work they have done over their lifetime. We are certainly as a nation indebted to them. I am particularly grateful that the 60th anniversary celebrations of national service held in Townsville yesterday yet again highlighted for the Australian community the work done by all of those who have served in the defence of our nation.</span>

                    <a href="J7Q" type="MemberSpeech">
                      <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Senator BACK</span>
                    </a> (<span class="HPS-State">Western Australia</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">11:31</span>):  I am pleased to speak to the Veterans' Entitlements Amendment Bill 2011. At the outset I must declare an interest as a member, however peripherally, of the defence family. Our youngest son was an active service officer with the Royal Australian Armoured Corps, in both Iraq as a lieutenant and in Afghanistan as a captain. So, I have both a personal and a professional interest in this issue. I join my colleagues in supporting these POW supplementary support measures. My only regret is that this was not put into place earlier by either side of the parliament. I fully support it and I am sure the wider Australian community do. I also support schedule 3, relating to the loss of earnings allowance. This is logical and it is what we expect the veteran community would want to see, and I have no doubt it is what the wider Australian community would want us to pass. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">In contrast, I join in the opposition to schedule 2 of the bill. It proposes that the power of the parliament to determine the manner in which compensation payments are offset against each other should be removed. In other words, as it has been explained to me, in the event that an ex-serviceman has been wounded and is being treated for some matter relating to their defence service and is then the subject, regrettably, of a further injury—for example a motor vehicle accident which occurred well after their defence experience—then there would be an offsetting of the compensation to that person one against the other, the non-defence related activity against the defence related activity. I find this to be unacceptable; I find it to be parsimonious. I cannot understand why we are even debating it. We are merely the representatives of the wider Australia community. We are elected by the com­munity to be here to represent the people. The first question I would put to my colleagues on the other side is simply this: do the people want the parliament's power to deal with this issue of offset to be gagged; do they expect this to be devolved to some group of people other than the parliament, duly elected? My second question is: do the people of Australia want there to be a further limiting of veterans entitlements in this type of incident? If a person has been wounded in their service to the nation then my expec­tation is that the wider community would say let the community meet the costs associated with rehabilitating that person so that they can come back to a normal life and contri­bute to their family, to the community and to their own wellbeing without there being, hanging over their heads, some concern that if subsequently they are injured in some other unrelated circumstance there is going to be some form of offsetting to limit their entitlements. I find this to be unacceptable and I would bet a pound to a penny that if we were to poll the wider Australian community they would too.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">In the legislation proposed by my colleague Senator Ronaldson only in recent weeks we anticipated the indexation of veterans entitlements. Again, if we were to poll the wider Australia community, people would not only have wanted that to happen but also would have shaken their heads and asked why it was ever the case that there was this disparity. It is not to the credit of this chamber that the ALP, the Greens and Senator Xenophon failed to support Senator Ronaldson in that instance. For those who do not understand the implications of that indexation, it is my understanding that the matter went back to 1997 when the age pension and the defence pension were similar, except that from that moment going forward the indexation for the age pension was a combination or a factor of both the CPI and the movement in wages. I see that as being entirely reasonable. Regrettably, defence pensions have not undergone the same level of indexation, having only been linked—and they remain only linked—to CPI. Wage movements over time in this country—certainly since 1997, given the economic growth we have enjoyed in that time—have caused the age pension to move upwards at a greater rate than the defence pension, so there is now a disparity between the two. Senator Ronaldson's bill aimed to redress that imbalance so that our defence veterans would enjoy the same level of benefit—nothing better; no improvement; nothing beyond—as our age pensioners. Surely that is reasonable given the service and sacrifice that they offered.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Veterans and ex-servicepeople have asked me—and rhetorically I ask it here on their behalf—the question, 'What have our service personnel done to incur the wrath of those on the other side and their failure to support that legislation?' They say to me: 'Where did we go wrong? Were we not diligent enough in the service we gave? Were we not competent enough in the service we delivered? Why are we being so harshly dealt with?' I cannot answer those questions.</span>
                </p>

                    </a>  Senator Xenophon is correct—why did we not address it when we were in government? Our failure to do so, however, is not an excuse to have failed to address that question in 2011. When we speak to everybody in the Australian community—younger people, older people, people across the board—what do they tell us they expect? When we tell them that our veterans are second-class citizens when it comes to the financial support they get from this nation, most people say to me, 'Go and fix it up.' And we have failed to do so. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">My third question, before I move on to the issue of younger veterans, relates to why the coalition did not receive the addendum to the explanatory memorandum until Senator Ronaldson was well into his speech. I think it should be explained why and how the Greens did have that access—and I compliment Senator Wright on her contribution. It is disappointing, if we are going to maturely debate an issue of such importance to the veteran community and of such interest to the wider community, that everybody has not had equal access to the documentation. I will return to this—I have had the opportunity presented to me by chamber staff to actually briefly review the addendum and I wish to return to it.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I was interested to hear the comments of Senator Macdonald with regard to the activities yesterday in Townsville. On Tuesday of last week, I was in the small town of Bruce Rock in the wheat belt of WA. It was absolutely amazing. There are, I think, a thousand people in the shire, with probably 200 to 300 living in the town. Right there in the main street was the most wonderful memorial to the fuzzy wuzzies. That memorial was dedicated last year—one of the original fuzzy wuzzies actually came down, with his son, to Australia and to Bruce Rock for the purpose.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Two Vietnam veterans decided, 11 years ago, that there should be some activity recognising the contribution of the Vietnam vets and the role they played, because we all know that the manner in which they were treated when they returned from Vietnam will, regrettably, forever be a stain on the history of this country. From that humble beginning 11 years ago, there will, when they meet on the first weekend of November this year, be 3,000 to 4,000 Vietnam veterans who will, with their families, descend on Bruce Rock. Last year there were 3,000 and this year they are expecting more. Some 400 are coming from Far North Queensland. It has become an annual event for them all. The shire president explained to me, with a high degree of pride, the activity that goes on, the contribution it makes to that small com­munity and the absolute overwhelming sense of goodwill that exists within those people.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Regrettably, should this legislation go through with the schedule that we are opposing, I am sure one of the questions discussed on that occasion will be the unfairness visited upon that group by the parliament through our inability to deal with this offsetting question. The event is an expression of the enormous interest in, the goodwill towards and the need for that community of military veterans to be able to come together to share values, to share stories and to encourage each other for the future. The last of the Korean War veterans also join them and it is my hope that, over time, should this activity continue in Bruce Rock, it will become a focal point.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">There is a group called the Mad Galahs—military veterans, usually non-commissioned officers and lower ranks. They are fairly strident in their views—they express them, as their name suggests, without fear or favour—and they have that long-held healthy Australian disrespect, at least overtly, for senior officers. I can assure you again that they voiced to me very loudly their disappointment about the recent defeat of Senator Ronaldson's bill.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Over the last four to five years I have had the experience of meeting with and becoming friendly with many of our younger returned soldiers who have left military service. I have to say to you that they are, in my view, the best of the best. I have met young Army, Navy and Air Force officers. I speak to them about what they are doing now, what they were doing in military service and I say, 'Did you really want to leave the service?' In so many instances—and I dare say in my own son's—deep down, they did not want to leave the service. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I have said to them, 'Is it because of the numbers of tours of duty you were required to undertake in places like Iraq, Afghanistan and elsewhere?' They are emphatic when they say, 'No, it's not that.' And so I have said to them, 'Is it because of inferior or inadequate standards of management in your fields of combat?' and the answer has been no. I have said to them, 'Is it because we haven't supplied you with adequate equipment?' and they have said no in the main, even though in some instances they have had to buy their own, which I find to be reprehensible. Nevertheless, on the whole they feel they have been well handled on their tours of duty in the field. So I have said to them, 'Is it because of the attitudes of the wider Australian community towards you?' As I said earlier, if there is one thing that has happened as a result of the history beyond Vietnam, it is that the Australian community now well understands the differential between our military personnel and the role they play and those who send them there—as should have been the case with Vietnam. We should have always thanked and glorified the Vietnam veterans and, if there were blame or criticism to be apportioned, it should have been sheeted home to the political leaders who sent them. The same occurs today.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I am delighted to record and report—and observe, as you all are—the fact that our returned servicepeople are well and truly adulated by the Australian community. So it is not that which has caused so much wastage of the best of our best of the young military personnel. I will tell you what it is. Almost without exception, it is what they perceive to be the indifference within the Defence bureaucracy and the approach of government to their welfare. These are questions I asked the previous Chief of the Defence Force. We engaged on this quite often. I remain far from satisfied as to the management, the treatment, the welfare and the concern of our personnel as they return. I could give you examples relating to many people. These young people are highly employable in the civilian world, at salaries vastly beyond what they were getting in service—and that was not a reason for them to want to leave—but it is the perceived indifference and the perceived attitude of the Defence bureaucracy which simply causes them to say, 'Things have to be better outside.' As I said, my own son was very concerned about the bureaucracy and the inefficiency. As I said to him, 'The only way you are going to find that it is no different outside the military world is to get yourself into the corporate world,' and he has certainly found that to be the case.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I conclude my comments by going back to this addendum, which was received some minutes after this debate commenced. As Senator Ian Macdonald has indicated, it now suggests a move from legislation to regulation and departmental decree, but it goes exactly to the point I was just making about the Defence bureaucracy. The document says:</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">the Smith decision is not explained. It goes on to say that where:</span>
                </p>

                  <span class="HPS-Small">... interaction between the compensation offsetting provisions and Chapter 19 ... and the ... Rates of Veterans’ Pensions, 5th Edition (GARP V), ... will not change under the proposed amendments.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">And it says:</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">then chapter 19 applies and on it goes. Then it says:</span>
                </p>

This is exactly the gobbledegook translated down to those in the ranks where they turn around and say, 'This is the bureaucracy we don't need.' I would think that if a person who is likely to be the subject of this legislation were to get hold of this document and say to themselves, 'What does it mean, what does it mean for me and what are the implications for me and ultimately for my family?' they would see that this document stands alone as an illustration of the points I make.</span>

I support the schedule 3 loss of earnings allowance and ask the government to reconsider schedule 2 because as it stands it would not receive the support of the Australian community.</span>

                    </a> (<span class="HPS-State">Victoria</span>—<span class="HPS-MinisterialTitles">Parliamentary Secretary for Defence</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">11:50</span>):  by leave—I table an addendum to the explanatory memorandum relating to the Veterans' Entitlements Amendment Bill 2011. The Veterans' Entitlements Amend­ment Bill gives effect to a number of 2011 budget measures. The first measure creates a new prisoner of war recognition supplement payable at $500 per fortnight to former prisoners of war. The new supplement will be tax free and will not be treated as income for the purposes of the income test. The supplement is payable in recognition of the hardships these men and women endured during captivity. It is expected that approximately 900 former prisoners of war will benefit from the new supplement, which will be payable from 20 September 2011.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The second measure clarifies and affirms the original intention of the compensation offsetting policy which applies to disability pensions and has been in place since 1973. Compensation offsetting is applied to disability pensions to ensure that a person does not receive compensation under the Veterans' Entitlement Act and compensation from another source for the same incapacity. The amendments to the compensation offsetting provisions are being made in response to a decision of the full Federal Court, which highlighted the need to clarify and affirm this aspect of the legislation. I might, as an aside, note that that decision of the full Federal Court is referred to in the addendum as 'the Smith decision'. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The amendments make it clear that compensation offsetting is to apply where a disability pension and compensation from another source are payable in respect of the same incapacity and do not require that the incapacity result from the same injury or disease. As the amendments are clarifying and affirming the legislation, they will not result in any change to the compensation offsetting practices currently being applied. No current disability pensioner's rate of disability pension will change because of the amendments in schedule 2 of the bill.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The final measure will rationalise payments for veterans and members who are undergoing treatment for war or defence caused injuries or diseases. The bill will remove the current overlap in the allowances paid to veterans and members who are unable to work due to episodes of medical treatment and recuperation for war or defence caused injuries or diseases, and it allows the government to better target assistance to those in need. Under this measure the payment of the temporary incapacity allowance will cease from 20 September 2011, with future payments being better targeted through the payment of the loss of earnings allowance. The cessation of the temporary incapacity allowance will have no impact on a veteran's or member's rate of disability pension. From 20 September 2011, all eligible veterans and members receiving treatment or recuperating from war or defence caused injuries or diseases will be assessed consistently against the criteria for loss of earnings allowance.</span>

If it is on the record that both the government and the opposition oppose this amendment then that would obviate the need for a division in these circumstances—if that would assist the chamber to proceed with the bill.

                    </a>   I thank the Senate. In setting out the reasons for the government's opposition to Senator Xenophon's proposed amendment, first let me point out that in the 2010-11 budget the government provided a $24 million com­pensation package to British nuclear test participants under the Veterans' Entitlements Act 1986. This package ensured that Australian Defence Force participants were provided appropriate compensation and health coverage for any condition related to their service in the testing program. British nuclear test participants are also eligible to receive non-liability health care for all cancers. British nuclear test participants are able to access a gold card. It is provided where the veteran is at or above 100 per cent of the general rate of disability pension. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The gold card is only automatically granted to veterans with qualifying service, and that of course means warlike service, and over the age of 70 in recognition of the hazards of being in war and incurring danger from hostile forces of the enemy. The automatic granting of a gold card to the group proposed by Senator Xenophon would thus place British nuclear test participants in a more beneficial position than other veterans. Any automatic extension of the gold card to this group would result in significant additional costs that have not been considered by the government. That is the basis upon which the amendment is opposed and that is the basis upon which the government makes the contention that it has ensured that British nuclear test participants receive adequate and proper compensation and assistance. </span>

                    </a> (<span class="HPS-State">Victoria</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">11:59</span>):  The opposition opposes schedule 2 in the following terms:</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">(2)   Schedule 2, page 10 (line 1) to page 15 (line 16), <span style="font-weight:bold;">TO BE OPPOSED</span>.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I want to talk about a number of matters today. I do have some questions for Senator Feeney, the Parliamentary Secretary for Defence, but I want to start the discussion on my amendment by again reiterating that the opposition strongly supports schedules (1) and (3). We do so in relation to schedule (1) because in government we had a very proud history of assistance for POWs and we do so in relation to schedule (3) because it makes eminent sense. We support the government on both of these matters.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The issue, both from the opposition's point of view and from the point of view of the Senate Foreign Affairs, Defence and Trade Legislation Committee with its dissenting report, and from many within the ex-service community, is schedule (2). The onus has been placed on the government to establish why this amendment is required now. Part of that onus, quite rightly, would involve, one would have thought, discussions between the government and the ex-service community on the justification for this schedule, in particular the outcome of the Smith case and the longstanding legal position in relation to these matters, given that the government is unable to say for sure whether anyone will be or will not be adversely impacted by the measures in schedule (2). In the budget, the government said that it wanted to spend $2.7 million to put in place processes to ensure that previous requirements for offsetting and identification of potential offsetting cases were made clearer. The obvious question to be asked about this is: why not get your systems in place first? What is the mad rush to go ahead with schedule (2) now, particularly with the degree of nervousness within the ex-service community on this matter? What is the requirement to do so now? </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">What really worries me and the rest of the opposition, as well as other senators in this place and the ex-service community, is the fact that there has been no consultation on this. The Smith case was decided in 2009. There was no consultation with the RSL, for example, prior to the budget. Prior to the budget, there was no discussion with the RSL on the budget measure. Given that everyone knew the circumstances surrounding the Smith case, and given that it had been discussed at the roundtable and other forums before that, why not consult with the ex-service community? Why not let them have some input into it? But it was actually worse than that. Even after the budget, the government still refused to discuss this until there was a referral to the Senate committee, and only then did the government start consultation with the ex-service community. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">To make matters worse, today we have learnt that the government's partners in crime in the running of this country, the Australian Greens—the Gillard-Brown government—were given the opportunity to see this revised explanatory memorandum well in advance of today's debate. Was Senator Xenophon shown that? Was the opposition shown that? Was the RSL shown that? Was the Vietnam Veterans Federation shown that? Was Legacy shown that? No, they were not. They were told that something would be coming, that there would be an amendment to the EM which would clarify it. They have not, on my understanding, to this day—certainly not of an hour and a half ago—been given the opportunity to see that amended EM. The parliamentary secretary has got to stand up here when I finish and say why the Australian Greens are deserving of this but the opposition is not. Forget the opposition! Why were the RSL, Legacy and the Vietnam Veterans Federation not given the opportunity to see this, given that the RSL attended the Senate inquiry and the Vietnam Veterans Federation, on my understanding at least, made a submission—if not, they have certainly written to me on the matter. So what is this about lack of consultation? Why is it that the spokesperson for the Australian Greens gets the opportunity to see this but the rest of us do not? On what basis does the government justify that? This is a matter of very, very significant concern to the ex-service community. They want to know that this schedule is not going to have a negative impact on anyone else and they, quite rightly, have been pursuing the government to get those guarantees. The government had the opportunity to consult on this matter. Why was my office not told the content of this revised EM? </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Why did the government choose to speak to the Greens about this rather than speaking to the ex-service community, when the President of the RSL himself had taken the time to appear before that committee and expressed some very significant concerns about this matter. I will read them for the parliamentary secretary. Rear Admiral Doolan said:</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">The RSL view is that it is much better to have the legislation being the basis for all these matters than to have it by regulation.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">That underpins the concerns of the ex-service organisation in relation to this matter.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I am sure that the Greens spokesperson felt very special getting the heads up about this. But surely the Greens felt some necessity to ensure that other people knew about it rather than doing a dirty deal with the government? What a start that is! Why not come to us and say: 'What do you think about this? You've got amendments on the table. You've had them there for some time. We know schedule 2 is an issue for you; why not come and have a talk to us about what that amended EM said?' Why not have the courtesy to go to Legacy, the RSL and others, show them the revised EM and ask for their opinion? Why not do them that courtesy?</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Let us look at our other concerns in relation to this. As I am sure the parlia­mentary secretary has been told by now, the Vietnam Veterans Federation and the RSL are extremely concerned about this matter being dealt with by regulation. I will tell you what else they will be concerned about. I read from the last part of the addendum to the explanatory memorandum:</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">The Repatriation Commission will be issuing appropriate policy guidance to the Department of Veterans' Affairs staff to ensure offsetting occurs in line with the legislation and long-standing practices outlined above. Ex-service organisations will be consulted during the development of this material.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">'Ex-service organisations will be consulted during the development of this material.' Why would they have any faith that they are going to be consulted about this when they were not consulted prior to the budget? They were not consulted until this matter was referred off to a Senate inquiry and they have not been consulted in relation to the addendum to the explanatory memorandum. Why would they have any confidence at all either that they are going to be consulted or their views are going to be listened to?</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">If you come back to me and say that you have put in place the IT systems, which we support—and I accept the words of the department that they need to ascertain whether there are going to be further offsetting issues—then we will talk to you about this schedule. But we are not prepared to take this from legislation into regulation. We do not believe the undertakings are sufficient to enable us to support it going from legislation to regulation.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I am amazed, quite frankly, that the government itself is prepared to impose a layer of risk on this by bringing this schedule in now. Get the system sorted out—we support you in getting the system sorted out—then come back into this chamber and say: 'We've got the systems worked out. We are confident that those systems will mean there will be no adverse impact for any veteran and we need to change the legislation to enable things to be done by way of regulation.' At that stage we will be quite happy to talk to you about it, but we are not prepared to take the authority of this chamber and give it to the department by way of potential regulation or other inter­pretation. We are not prepared to remove the right of this chamber on this matter. I am absolutely amazed that the government is prepared to do so. Get the systems sorted out. We support your systems being sorted out. It seems a lot of money but if that is the view of what is required to sort the systems out, go for it; it has our support. But do not come here and put the cart before the horse.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I say to the Greens that if they are serious about ensuring that there is no adverse impact for any veteran then they will abandon the quite obscene sign-up to this addendum to the EM and they will say to the government as well, 'You come back when you have put your systems in place and then we will talk about whether schedule 2 is required.' The government has failed to justify this schedule. The government has been told by the ex-service organisations that they do not support this schedule. The government has been asked by those ex-service organisations not to rush into this because the ex-service organisations quite rightly want to be 100 per cent sure that there will be no adverse impact. Perhaps the parliamentary secretary, given everything I have said today, can tell me this: what is the requirement for this to be done now, prior to the systems being put in place? Why can this schedule not be removed? I will speak to the minister as soon as those systems are in place and both he and I are confident that there will be no adverse impact. Then we can get it through this place very, very quickly. But at the moment there is no justification. At the moment the ex-service organisations are opposed to this. The parliamentary secretary has the opportunity to actually support the removal of this schedule, get the systems in place and then come back so we can talk about it. <span style="font-style:italic;">(Time expired)</span></span>

                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">
                    <a href="I0O" type="MemberSpeech">
                      <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Senator FEENEY</span>
                    </a> (<span class="HPS-State">Victoria</span>—<span class="HPS-MinisterialTitles">Parliamentary Secretary for Defence</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">12:15</span>):  I am happy to endeavour to respond to some of the points made by Senator Ronaldson. Firstly, I will turn my attention to the question of the explanatory memor­andum. As I comprehend it, the Senate com­mittee suggested that additional information be inserted into the explanatory memor­andum to make it clear that established offsetting practices will not change as a result of the amendments. The additional information also includes an explanation of the interaction between chapter 19 of the <span style="font-style:italic;">Guide to the assessment of rates of veterans' pensions</span> and the offsetting provisions. It is my understanding that ex-service organisa­tions are aware that the government is now making changes and that in large part those changes reflect requests of government by those organisations.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">As to the mystery of when and how the addendum came to be lodged, I cannot really assist Senator Ronaldson except to say that I understand it was lodged with the Table Office on Friday. I will allow Senator Ronaldson to pursue the rest of the mystery as he sees fit.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">In response to the opposition's allegation that the government has failed to fully justify the need for a change I would point out that the rationale behind the amendments has been explained in the budget materials, in the explanatory memorandum and at the committee hearings. I will reiterate that the amendments will not change the operation of the offsetting provisions but merely clarify and affirm the longstanding policy of numerous governments in relation to offsetting disability pension compensation. The clarification of the legislation will assist veterans, their representatives and others involved in such matters to understand how the offsetting arrangements operate.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">It is critical for the government to place on the record that the proposed amendments will not and cannot result in a double offset as has been alleged. When the <span style="font-style:italic;">Guide to the assessment of rates of veterans' pensions</span> is used, the offsetting provisions cannot apply in respect of that impairment. The operation of the <span style="font-style:italic;">Guide to the assessment of rates of veterans' pensions</span><span style="font-style:italic;"></span>does not fully cover all cases in which individuals have different conditions attributed to an incapacity. In essence, the operation of that guide covers only one potential set of circumstances. The proposed amendments are necessary to deal with circumstances that are not dealt with under that guide and in which it is not possible to use that guide.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">As for the assertion that the government did not consult with the ex-service community prior to incorporating these amendments, let me first make the point that the Department of Veterans' Affairs has engaged in appropriate consultation with the ex-service community in relation to the full Federal Court's decision in Commonwealth v Smith. The Department of Veterans' Affairs has consulted with the ex-service community from budget night onwards about the proposed amendments to the offsetting provisions of the Veterans' Entitlements Act. This consultation has been undertaken in accordance with the confidentiality restrictions associated with budget measures and legislation.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">On the question of the computer software and the changing of systems, the Department of Veterans' Affairs is committing staff and information technology resources to improving existing policy, procedural and other resource material concerning the application of the offsetting provisions. This work would be taking place regardless of the proposed amendments now being considered. This work includes the improve­ments of existing systems and the creation of better tools for staff to manage claims for which offsetting is required. It will also work to improve communication with affected clients and interested stakeholders. The provision of policy guidance material to staff, particularly in areas of complexity such as this one, is longstanding common practice.</span>

I will call Senator Wright, who might want to respond until 12.30 to some of your earlier points. I have no other way but to continue in that manner.</span>

We are in a bind here. Your question must be put immediately, which I cannot do until 12.30. Once that is voted on, depending on the outcome of that vote, that would determine whether or not we progress with this bill. So we have a five-minute delay.</span>

                    </a> (<span class="HPS-State">Victoria</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">12:24</span>):  I thought it would be! But only for five minutes. We are insisting on this matter being put and voted on, because we do not believe that within 24 hours the government cannot ascertain from the Vietnam Veterans Federation, the RSL and Legacy whether this addendum to the EM clarifies their concerns. I am completely and utterly gobsmacked—to use an expression my children use—that the government is not actually asking the question, because this may well resolve this issue. If the RSL, the Vietnam Veterans Federation and Legacy come back and say that the addendum satisfies all their queries, my view would be that the opposition would look very seriously at that. If they come back and say that it still does not clarify their concerns, then that position would surely require a change of attitude from the government in relation to the progress of this matter.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This is not a political point between the government and the opposition. This is about whether or not we are prepared to take a risk in relation to entitlements and in relation to people's futures. Surely it is incumbent upon the chamber to do that. For the sake of just four, five or six hours, go back to the RSL. I will call it now: if I get a phone call from the RSL, from the Vietnam Veterans Federation and from Legacy that this amendment satisfies their concerns I give the parlia­mentary secretary an undertaking that we will not oppose this schedule.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The chamber needs to understand that we are opposed to this schedule because those who know best what the likely outcome of this schedule might be have been opposed to it themselves. This debate is not rocket science. If those organisations are concerned about it, then we should be concerned about it. If their concerns have not been clarified to their satisfaction then we should be con­cerned about what the outcomes might be. Why not just send this addendum off to these three groups and then can come back to us. We can put this off until tomorrow. I give the parliamentary secretary and the minister my undertaking that if these groups come back and say, 'That has satisfied our queries,' that will be the end of the matter and it will go through. But we are not prepared to stand here when those three organisations, and presumably others, have expressed that they are dissatisfied with what has been promised to date and that they still have concerns. I cannot believe that Senator Wright, whom I have known for a long time, would not be prepared to accept that we need to get this clarified. We can then move on from this matter. I do not want to see anything occur that is going to impact on other parts of the bill, but I am not going to cop it today by supporting a schedule that is not supported by very significant sections of the ESOs. Let them have a look at this amended EM. Let them come back and tell the government they are happy with it. If I get the same phone call, this matter will be dealt with and we can move on to other legislation. You have my firm undertaking that if Legacy, the Vietnam Veterans Federation and the RSL say that the addendum to the EM meets their concerns that will be the end of the matter. But we are not prepared to sell these organisations down the river. We are not prepared potentially to risk the rights of veterans in this country. We are not prepared to take this from being legislation to being a regulation. I cannot believe that anyone in this chamber would not be prepared to accept that we need to get some clarification about the addendum from those who are opposed to it. I am sure my colleague would be very happy to hear from the RSL, because my colleague sat in on this inquiry. Senator Fawcett was there and he heard the National President of the RSL expressing his concerns. If the National President of the RSL comes back to Senator Fawcett, Senator Eggleston and me and says, 'We are prepared to accept what is in the addendum,' then the matter gets through.</span>

                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I ask the government: please, just for the sake of four or five hours, go and get some advice in relation to this. It should have been done beforehand. Everyone knows it should have been done beforehand. It was not, but let's just get on with it. I will have nothing further to say about the lack of consultation if we defer this, find out what it is and come back. We can get it listed. We can get it slotted in. We can get it done and dusted very quickly. There are no more speakers. We are in committee. We can deal with this. Let's deal with it on the back of reasonable knowledge about the people who are not owed a disservice from this chamber by not being consulted in relation to it. I ask the Greens: if the government is not prepared to accept this, please support us for the sake of literally four or five hours. It may well be that this can be clarified this afternoon—I do not know. But it is a matter of getting this material to those organisations who are owed the courtesy of consultation by everyone in the chamber—not just the government, not just the opposition, not just the Greens and not just Senator Xenophon and Senator Madigan. Everyone in this chamber owes them the courtesy of finding out what their views are in relation to this matter.</span>

                    </a> (<span class="HPS-State">South Australia</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">12:39</span>):  The Australian Greens do not support the opposition's amendment. As I pointed out in my speech in the second reading debate, despite initial concerns about the effects of schedule 2 which were raised prior to the inquiry, during the inquiry and with me subsequently, I have now satisfied myself that schedule 2 is not intended to and will not effectively change the previous practice in relation to offsetting. I am satisfied that it will affirm and clarify the existing situation and that it is appropriate that schedule 2 remain in the bill. The Australian Greens are not prepared to jeopardise the passage of the beneficial provisions in schedule 1 of the bill nor the sensible rationalisation provisions in schedule 3 and to hold up consideration of the bill because of concerns that have been raised about schedule 2, having satisfied ourselves that those concerns have been adequately addressed in changes to the explanatory memorandum.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I have been able to come to this view because I have been at pains to consult with and consider the concerns of the RSL and the VVFA and to discuss those concerns in some detail with the government. Although my motives have been somewhat impugned today, I would like to just put on the record that when looking at legislation I am keen to seek the best outcomes possible through consideration of the legislation, consultation and, where possible, collaboration with inter­ested parties. I initiated these discussions both with the organisations that I consulted with and with the government and, having heard those concerns, negotiated to address them to see if an alternative way of addressing the concerns was available. I have acted in good faith.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I cannot answer on what attempts the opposition made to enter into fruitful negotiations with the government about their concerns. I cannot be held responsible for that and the Australian Greens cannot be held responsible for what negotiations were carried out. What I do know is that, having heard the concerns of the RSL and the Vietnam Veterans Federation of Australia, and having had further discussions about those, I was satisfied that the changes to the explanatory memorandum would address those concerns. Although I was not at liberty to necessarily show the explanatory memorandum to the organisations, because that was not within my control, I conveyed to those organisations my view that that was adequate. I felt that I had heard their concerns and that they understood that their concerns had been addressed in the explanatory memorandum, although of course they might not be fully satisfied.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The suggestion that somehow the current situation is enshrined only in legislation is misleading in that there is already an administrative practice and discretion, and I am satisfied that schedule 2 of the bill will not change that situation and that indeed there will be further steps taken as set out in the explanatory memorandum to develop guidelines in consultation with ex-service organisations to direct and guide the decision making of the officials of the Department of Veterans' Affairs so that there will be no effective change to what has been agreed to be an effective, fair and good working system up until now. So the Australian Greens are not able to support the opposition's amendments.</span>

                    </a> (<span class="HPS-State">South Australia</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">12:43</span>):  I indicate that I for one do not impugn Senator Wright's intentions or motives in relation to this. I just want to make that clear. I am not doing that. I have concerns, though, because the onus is on the government to ensure that these amendments will not have unintended consequences. I commend Senator Wright for her diligence and the genuine nature in which she has approached this particular issue. But I did support the coalition in relation to the last division with respect to progress being reported. In other words: I supported the delaying of this bill until we heard from some of the key stakeholders—in particular, from the RSL. Now, unless the Parlia­mentary Secretary for Defence, Senator Feeney, is able to provide the chamber with information that the RSL has seen the precise wording of this addendum to the explanatory memorandum and has had a chance to consider the precise wording, I for one am reluctant for this bill to proceed. Given the will of the chamber is that the bill does proceed, I think the appropriate course of action is that the Senate examine forensically schedule 2 and the addendum to the explanatory memorandum, which has a arisen as a result of the diligence and hard work of Senator Wright. But there are still legitimate questions to ask about the potential effects.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Given that the RSL has commented on this previously and that it was a participant to the Senate inquiry into the bill, in which Senator Fawcett, among others, had an active role—I acknowledge Senator Fawcett's service to this nation, given his distinguished background in the Australian Defence Force—the gaping concern to me is that, it is important we find out what the key stakeholders are saying. So, if I may, I ask the parliamentary secretary: since this matter was last raised in committee has there been any sign off, any communication, from the Returned and Services League or other key stakeholder groups, such as the Vietnam Veterans Federation, in relation to the addendum to the explanatory memorandum to this bill?</span>

Whether they have seen the actual addendum itself, I am unfortunately not in a position to advise the Senate. In the event, Senator Xenophon, that you require the stated support of the RSL in order to support this bill, I am not in a position to assist you. Obviously, it is not for me to say what is the position of the RSL or of any of the other ex-service organisations. That is obviously a matter for them. As for the consultation that has taken place with them, I have nothing further to add. Insofar as your point goes to schedule 2, and the onus being on the government, all I can do is repeat the point made in my second reading speech—that is, these amendments are clarifying and affirming the legislation and will not result in any change to the compensation offsetting practices currently being applied.</span>

Is it not within the wherewithal of Senator Feeney, repre­senting the government, to advise whether the addendum to the explanatory memor­andum was actually shown to the RSL? I do not think is it an unreasonable question. If the RSL has been shown it, and has not said anything about it, that might, if it does not solve the problem, go some considerable way to resolving this issue. If the RSL is acquiescent, if it is comfortable, about this addendum to the explanatory memorandum, it would reassure me about this issue. Is it not possible to establish whether the RSL has been shown a copy of the addendum to the explanatory memorandum that was filed this morning?</span>

                    </a> (<span class="HPS-State">South Australia</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">12:50</span>):  There was a Rolling Stones song, Mr Chairman, about not being able to get any satisfaction, and it was alluded to by Senator Feeney. There is another Rolling Stones song that goes along the lines of: you can't always get what you want, but sometimes you might just get what you need. I know Senator Feeney is a big Rolling Stones fan—I can just tell. He is a Jaggerite; a Mick Jagger acolyte. All I want is to establish whether this particular addendum has been shown to the RSL. Given the RSL's involvement in this, does Senator Feeney concede it is quite reasonable for the RSL to be shown this addendum to the explanatory memorandum, which arose out of some considerable negotiations between Senator Wright's office, on behalf of the Greens, and the government? Again I commend Senator Wright for the work she has done on this. It is not a difficult issue. I just want to get what I need.</span>

You are also the Parliamentary Secretary for Defence. We have been debating this since 10 o'clock this morning. Do not tell me, when you have got one of the minister's advisers sitting beside you, that you cannot give this chamber an answer to a very simple question. Were they provided with it or not? How does it take three hours to ascertain whether the RSL has been given a copy of this? The longer you drag this out, the more obvious I think the response is. If they have not, just say, 'No, they have not been' and then I will make the comment that they should have been—which I am sure you will not. Have they or have they not been shown this for comment? It is a very, very simple question. Senator Xenophon and I want to know the answer.</span>

                    </a> (<span class="HPS-State">South Australia</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">12:54</span>):  I draw the Senate's attention to the evidence given by the RSL during the inquiry around the issue of consultation. The minister had made comment that there was wide consultation. Does the senator believe that consultation is required? Rear Admiral Doolan said:</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">The point we made earlier on was that the first we knew of this was when the legislation was brought forward. When we became aware of the legislation, we were on a short timescale to provide input to this Senate committee, which we did.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">It became apparent that it was a prebudget eve briefing that they had received on the information. When we brought this up with DVA and asked, 'Did you consult?' one of the officials responded:</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">As the RSL have said, we regularly provide a prebudget briefing, and that is on the day of the budget. In that briefing we explained a whole range of measures coming through in the budget, including offsetting, and explained that the intention of the amendment … But it is true that there was no extensive prebudget consultation about the amendment itself. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">So they clearly said that there was no extensive prebudget consultation, which puts lie to the claim that there has been widespread consultation. My question is: do you support the need to consult with key stakeholders in this whole process?</span>

Yes, Senator, I hope you will have noted that in one of my earlier contributions I did touch upon the fact that the Department of Veterans' Affairs has been engaged in consultation with ex-service organisations and that is obviously something that is of great importance and of great continuing importance. I think it is fair to say that in every interaction I have ever had with Veterans' Affairs, whether through the estimates process or through debate in this place, the importance of those service organisations and the perspectives they bring are acknowledged and understood by all. </span>

                    </a> (<span class="HPS-State">South Australia</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">12:57</span>):  The question was not at all to ask you to comment on the RSL; the question was going to the point that the government has claimed there is consultation. You have just made the claim again that the department engages in consultation. In broad terms I accept that that does occur on a frequent basis. What we are talking about here specifically is schedule 2, this offsetting provision. What became very clear during the committee hearing was that in fact there had been no consultation. There had been a briefing, a one-way flow of information, the night before the budget, which does not give anybody any confidence that there has been a serious attempt to consult. The question is—and it is raised again around this explanatory memorandum—does the government believe in the value of consultation with key stakeholders and will you give them the courtesy of the opportunity to provide feedback before this becomes part of law?</span>

                    </a> (<span class="HPS-State">Victoria</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">12:58</span>):  I have just been advised by the Vietnam Veterans Federation that they have not seen the changes to the explanatory memorandum resulting from their concerns. They understand that the Greens had negotiated some amendments, but they had not seen them. Senator Wright, I was reflecting on the fact that you had been given these changes—not you personally. The fact remains that you were shown amendments to the EM by the government to ensure your support for schedule 2, knowing that the government did not have the support of the opposition in relation to schedule 2 because of the concerns of the ex-service community. You ultimately, Senator Wright, will need to make a decision in about two minutes time as to whether you think it is appropriate for one political party to negotiate the terms of an explanatory memorandum when the ex-service organisations, who have expressed a real concern about this, have indicated in a Senate inquiry that there has not been appropriate consultation. You will have an opportunity to say whether you think that is acceptable. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This is not a reflection on you at all, Senator Wright, but it is most certainly a reflection on your party. Following all the talk from the Australian Greens about consultation and doing the right thing, about making sure the process is right, here is an opportunity for them to prove that this was not a political stitch-up between the government and the Greens in relation to this change in the addendum to the explanatory memorandum. Here is the opportunity for her to say that they actually do agree with due process. Here is the opportunity for her, in about two minutes time, to say that they are not prepared to let this go through until they have canvassed appropriately and properly the views of the ex-service organisations and only then will they support the three schedules; only then will they support schedule 2.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I direct this to the parliamentary secretary as well as to Senator Wright: having had confirmation that the Vietnam Veterans Federation has not seen the changes, how can this chamber possibly countenance this matter being dealt with now? How can we possibly countenance completely ignoring the views of organisations who have been participants in this process? How can the Australian Greens support such an abuse of process by forcing this legislation to be dealt with before we get the views of those ex-service organisations? How can the parliamentary secretary and the government possibly countenance forcing this chamber to deal with this matter until they have actually consulted with the participants in this process, one of whom took substantial time to involve themselves in the Senate inquiry process? How can that be a reasonable outcome for this chamber? How can anyone sitting in the gallery say this is an appropriate process for this parliament to be involved in? </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This is simple—this is not knocking off a bit of legislation which has to go back to the other place and then possibly come here and then become new legislation. All we on this side are asking—and I will speak for Senator Xenophon—is for the government to assure us that the consultation we think is appropriate has been carried out. Then we will deal with this matter. Either these organisations will be happy with it and it will go through or, if they are still not happy with it, the government has to make a decision about whether it is prepared to go against their wishes. And for what? The government says it is about to spend money anyway getting in place the systems it says it needs to address potential issues further down the track—and I said I accept that. So it can go and spend the money and then we will worry about what is in schedule 2. But it is totally inappropriate for this matter to be dealt with today before proper consultation has been carried out. These are not some mickey mouse groups that have sprung up after a good spring rain. This is the RSL, this is Legacy, this is the Vietnam Veterans Federation. Surely to goodness they deserve the respect of this chamber enough to be consulted on this matter. I move:</span>

                    </a> (<span class="HPS-State">South Australia</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">13:11</span>):  I will reflect firstly on Senator Ronaldson's references to Senator Wright's involvement in this matter. I have a slightly different perspective. I do not think it is incumbent upon Senator Wright to enter into widespread consultation with key groups; I think the primary responsibility for that rests with the government. That is what I think is fair. I acknowledge Senator Wright's hard work on this and I acknowledge the spirit in which she undertook those negotiations. From my perspective, it is fair to say that it is the government's obligation to consult with the key stakeholders, not necessarily that of Senator Wright or the Greens. So I have a slightly different perspective on that.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">But I do agree wholeheartedly with Senator Ronaldson, who has become my spokesperson on this particular issue—maybe more broadly; we will wait and see—that it is unwise and unsafe to proceed further in the absence of hearing from the RSL, from the Vietnam Veterans Federation, from Legacy and from other key stake­holders who participated fully in the Senate inquiry and who have a longstanding interest in this. I understand, however, that it is the will of the chamber to proceed to deal with these matters now. It is therefore incumbent upon me to ask the parliamentary secretary, Senator Feeney, a number of specific questions relating to the explanatory memorandum. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I note that the explanatory memorandum starts off by saying that the proposed amendments will not change the current operation of the compensation offsetting provisions. My first question is: to what extent will these amendments change current arrangements at all if they do not change the compensation offsetting provisions? Is it the case that, whilst they will not strictly change the current compensation offsetting pro­visions, they may change the way in which matters are dealt with in terms of compensation offsetting? It is a technical question but, given that so much of this will turn on technical issues, it is only the first of a number of such questions I have with respect to the explanatory memorandum.</span>

                    </a>  Excellent. Perhaps we will get you some satisfaction, Senator. Perhaps Senator Ronaldson's days as your spokesperson are numbered. I understand that the RSL and the Vietnam Veterans Federation of Australia have seen all parts of the addendum with the exception of the final paragraph—that is, the paragraph beginning 'The Repatriation Commission'. I can advise the Senate that the discussions with VVFA and DVA on concerns about double dipping have occurred, that there have been discussions between the Department of Veterans' Affairs and the operational working party, which is comprised of ex-service organisations, on the text of the explanatory memorandum. There has been a discussion between the minister's office, the RSL and the VVFA about the explanatory memorandum. Further, I am advised that John Hodges of the RSL has indicated he is broadly supportive and I note again that the explanatory memorandum does not change anything—that it spells out the current operations and sets out the fact that there will be further consultations.</span>

We are debating amendments which the government has just said will result in no change. If we are debating amendments which will result in no change, why then have the amendments put in the first place? To be fair to Senator Feeney, he has said that they will result in clarifying the current provisions. I think that is the summary of what Senator Feeney has outlined. I am grateful to Senator Feeney for finally responding—that is, for the government finally being able to respond; it was not Senator Feeney's fault—to the issue I raised with Senator Ronaldson. If these amendments will result in no change, as we have just heard, to what extent will they result in clarifying the established compensation offsetting practices and, to the extent that they do clarify the offsetting practices, does the clarification in itself result in some change in the way the current provisions are being dealt with?</span>

You ask the question: if these amendments do not change anything, why are we doing this? I guess the answer to that question is that these amendments are in response to a decision of the full Federal Court in Commonwealth of Australia v Smith, which decision highlights the need to clarify and affirm these aspects of the legislation. That is what we are doing.</span>

We are talking here about a very specific issue and, indeed, one of great importance to many deserved folk. This is legislation that the government is pursuing, and it is pursuing it on the basis that it is good legislation, that it is required in the aftermath of the Smith decision, that it realises government policy which the government has been clearly expounding upon through the budget process, the budget and subsequently. Lastly, we are mindful of the fact that we are making changes here that we believe have the broad support of ex-service organisations.</span>

I would not think this bill would come back until well after question time. Unless the government is going to gag me, I will be here at 10 seconds to two. I assure the parliamentary secretary that, until we find out what the views of the RSL, the Vietnams Veterans Federation and Legacy are, as is only appropriate, we will continue debating this matter. I will be very careful about the way I put this: I am taking the parliamentary secretary at face value because I acknowledge that the parlia­mentary secretary does not have personal knowledge of this matter and the parlia­mentary secretary has taken advice from departmental and ministerial staff on this matter. If it is incorrect, I will hold him to account only to the extent that he was providing the chamber with information he had been provided with. But he will not be surprised to know that I will be very deeply concerned if the advice that has been given today is incorrect. If, indeed, it is correct that the document was passed around the table on 26 August, was there a consultation process put in place for that circulated document?</span>

What you are saying is that a group which had been actively involved in this matter was actually not going to be provided with a copy of this until it was raised in this chamber. You were working on the basis, were you not, that this bill would be dealt with by the Senate today and the RSL would be provided with a full copy of the addendum after the event? Parliamentary Secretary, do you believe that is an appropriate course of action on behalf of the government?</span>

You might put forward the contention, if you will, that our consultation process has been inadequate—that is a matter for you and I am sure you will enliven that point to the best of your abilities—but the government's position on this is very clear and it is very simple. Arising from a decision of a full bench of the Federal Court, we were required to do the responsible and sensible thing and make amendments to this legislation so that the legislation is clear and effective. The amendments clarify and affirm the legislation. They will not result in any change to the compensation-offsetting practices currently being applied. We have made this point again and again and again.</span>

We have prepared an addendum and we have done that in response to the Senate committee, to our discussions with the Greens party and to discussions with others. As for the forensic detail, emails and so forth, I have provided you with the very best information that I have to hand. The fundamental point remains the same—these are not mighty changes. They are not going to result in the current practices changing. They are not going to result in a diminution of entitlements.</span>

                    </a> (<span class="HPS-State">Victoria</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">13:37</span>):  I am glad you believe that commentary about appropriate consultation is histrionics. I can give you some histrionics if you want it but I put this to you: is it histrionics to question the government about its consultation processes? Is it histrionics to say that it is inappropriate for one minor political party, which just happens to be your government partner, to get information that is not provided to ex-service organisations? As I said to you before, these are not groups that spring up after a good spring rain. These are the peak bodies in this country. Are you telling the chamber that it is histrionics to demand why any political party has an arrangement and a scenario of consultation when those groups that are actively and intimately involved in this process do not? If that is the government's definition of histrionics then, quite frankly, heaven help us.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The simple fact is that we have been advised today that the RSL was given a copy of this document only after this debate started and after the government had been caught out in relation to the lack of consultation. That is not histrionics. The simple fact is that if it had not been raised today this matter would have gone through without the RSL having had any input into it whatsoever; it would have been a fait accompli. The Vietnam Veterans Federation would not have had any input into it; it would have been a fait accompli. Legacy would not have had any input into it; it would have become a fait accompli. If that is the way that you want to carry out your consultation process, that is fine. If the Greens think that is an appropriate consultation process, that is fine. But everyone be on notice: what the Greens say and what the Greens do are often two entirely different matters.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The Greens were given the opportunity today to say, 'For the sake of three or four hours, we are going to clarify this situation and clarify whether those peak bodies are supportive of this addendum.' Then petty politics entered into this debate. You are not prepared for the sake of four or five hours to concede a bit of ground on this matter. You are driven by petty pride for a very simple matter. There is no reason why this chamber could not have dealt with this matter later today or in the morning—no reason at all. But petty pride means that the government and the Greens are not prepared to accept that the right thing should be done in this case. I am absolutely staggered that the Greens have been prepared to compromise themselves to this extent by not acknowledging that three or four hours can get some serious clarification. I am utterly amazed, given the need for the government and the department to maintain close working relationships with these ESOs, that they also have not been prepared for the sake of three or four hours to do so. If that is histrionics, you have got it.</span>

                    </a> (<span class="HPS-State">South Australia</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">13:42</span>):  I put on the record again my understanding that the very reason the last paragraph in the explanatory memorandum was inserted was after I made an assiduous effort to consult with both the RSL and the VVFA to clarify their concerns. I took those concerns to the government as they concerned me as well, particularly in relation to the degree of discretion that was potentially available to the Repatriation Commission and decision makers in the Department of Veterans' Affairs in implementing the scheme that would be in effect once the amendments were passed. My understanding after quite a degree of discussion was that there have always been administrative arrangements in place; that there was no intention as a result of the amendments to change those administrative arrangements; that they had worked and had operated effectively over quite a significant period of time and that no complaints had been received from the veterans community about those administrative arrangements. But, to ameliorate the concerns that I had, which were directly being passed on because of my consultation with the RSL and the VVFA, there was an agreement to add a further paragraph in the explanatory memorandum to clarify that there would be specific guidelines drafted to ensure the situation did not change and that there would be consultation with the ex-service organisations to allow input into those guidelines to again assuage their concerns.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Rather than, as has been suggested, some mucky deal being done where the concerns of two significant veterans associations, the RSL and the Vietnam Veterans Federation of Australia, are ignored or undermined, in fact it is the opposite. Late on Friday I was still relaying to the government my concern about unintended consequences of the amendments if they were to pass. I then in full transparency contacted those organisations and spoke to members of those organisations and conveyed to them my view that the changes to the explanatory memorandum would satisfy their concerns and it satisfied my concerns that the ultimate effect of passing these amendments, particularly schedule 2, would not have unintended consequences that would make the lot of veterans worse given that the assurance all the way through has been that that would not be the case.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Having given a lot of consideration to this matter, the Greens were of the view that, rather than waste the valuable time of the chamber, where there are beneficial provisions that presumably some veterans are waiting to take effect, the prisoner of war recognition provisions and other sensible provisions that would allow a sensible rationalisation of two very similar allowances, rather than holding those up unnecessarily and having satisfied myself that I had been open and thoughtful and considerate of the concerns of the VVFA and the RSL, I formed the view that it was appropriate to support the bill. That is why the Greens have taken the position that we have taken.</span>

I am sure an enormous amount of due diligence has gone into this. I am not aware that Senator Wright is an expert in this field but she may well be and if she is then I apologise. But it is not actually a matter of Senator Wright satisfying herself; it is about Senator Wright and the Greens and the government satisfying themselves that indeed proper process has been followed. That is what it is all about, not whether Senator Wright has satisfied herself in relation to this. Senator Wright could have satisfied herself in relation to this by actually telling those organisations what was in this addendum to the explanatory memorandum and asking them. If they had said to her on the back of her going to them with the words from this addendum, 'I am satisfied with it,' then Senator Wright would be quite entitled to make the comments that she has. She actually would have tested her views in relation to this against the addendum. But she has not tested those views against the addendum. She has tested her views in relation to her interpretation, not on the back of what the peak bodies were saying about it. So, with the greatest respect, that is not sufficient investigative work. </span>

This advice is in plain-speaking language, which is easier for departmental staff and veterans and their advocates to understand. The policy has been available broadly speaking for a long time. While I am on my feet, I might also read into the transcript an email that has only just been received, at least by me. It is to Mr Ross Bain, who is the chief of staff to the Minister for Veterans' Affairs, and it is from Mr John Hodges. It reads:</span>

So we have spent the last three hours trying to ascertain what the views were of the ex-service organisations who have been involved in this process. Why was this not done beforehand? I am not suggesting for one minute that what has been given to Mr Bain, what you have read out, is not correct. But I want to consult with the RSL and the Vietnam Veterans Federation over question time and taking note and whatever time is there, and indeed if their position is that they are happy to let this go through then it will go through. But why was not this done at 10 past 10 this morning? Why have we gone through this charade trying to ascertain the views of these ex-service organisations, the charade of not knowing whether people had or had not been given documents, the charade about whether people had or had not been consulted. Three hours we have spent on this when we should have at an early stage had the sort of advice we are now starting to get through a drip feed.</span>

You then said that that work has been done for some time. My question related specifically to the added but not distributed addendum to the explanatory memorandum. I suppose I am either entitled to say, 'Well, yes, it has been, and it has been there for some time,' or 'The work has just started.' Which one is it? Has it been there for some time and therefore, if it has, that is what the department will be relying on? Or has it started in the last three hours? You cannot have it both ways, Parliamentary Secretary. Either the work has already been done and you are going to rely on it—<span class="HPS-MemberIInterjecting">s</span>hake your head as you may, I am only quoting your words. I am just quoting your words, old boy, and the simple fact is that you said it had been underway for some time and they were already there. You are now telling me they have just started it. Given that, according to your comrade in arms from the Greens, she was still negotiating with the government late on Friday afternoon, have they started that work since nine o'clock this morning? Is that what you are telling us? Or, indeed, has all this work been done? Was that just put in to satisfy a few whims, according to you—and, indeed, the consultation will not be required because the decisions have already been made? If it is there and has been there for some time, why do we need this particular piece of legislation?</span>

It is also, I think, worth noting that after your extraordinary performance denouncing how long this process has taken you might very well reflect on the quality of your questions and the fact that you have managed to call two completely pointless divisions during these proceedings. Two things, very simply: longstanding policy is on the web, and work relating to the addendum has only just commenced.</span>

The parliamentary secretary has just indicated to us that we had two wasted divisions today while we ascertained what the advice from the ex-service organisations was. Guess what? One of those divisions occurred before you gave the RSL the document you are talking about, so that was a waste, was it? Consultation was a waste—when it was done before you sent them the material, sent them the addendum? That was a waste, was it? I am glad you think that consultation is a waste! I am glad you think that the RSL and the Vietnam veterans federation and Legacy are also a waste, because that is implicit in your comment! That is what you are saying. We wasted time this morning while you ascertained two very simple things. The first one was whether the RSL and the Vietnam veterans federation had been consulted. The second one was what their response was. And we got their response 15 minutes ago, which actually postdated the other of the divisions that you are talking about.</span>

Every single time, they will bring you unstuck, because what they say and what they do are two entirely different matters.</span>

I said to you at 10 past 10 this morning and I gave you an undertaking at least two hours ago that, if you satisfy this chamber that you have had the consultations and you can satisfy the chamber—if you are telling this chamber—that the people whom you are asking to sign up to this and to whom you had not given the benefit of the document are supportive, we will support this measure. Do not talk about wasting divisions. Do not talk about abuse of due process. Do not rely on the Australian Greens to do your job for you. Get out and consult. Do what you should be doing. Deal with the RSL and Legacy and the Vietnam veterans federation in the manner in which they would expect to be dealt with; they deserve absolutely no less. If the President is here, I will sit down. I presume we are now holding this matter over, Mr Temporary Chairman.</span>

Senator Cormann has asserted in relation to the Future Fund that the government is raiding the Future Fund—that the govern­ment is withdrawing funds from the Future Fund. He is wrong. He is utterly and com­pletely wrong, and he ought to know better.</span>

                  </a>  Mr President, a point of order on the requirement under the standing orders for the minister to be directly relevant to the question: there was a very specific question and the answer is a number. The secretary of the finance department has confirmed that the revenue in 2012-13 will include revenue from the sale of assets from the Future Fund. The question is: how much of that $4.937 billion will come from proceeds from the sale of Future Fund assets? It is a number; there was no political rhetoric in the question. All we have been getting from the minister is political rhetoric, yet again.</span>

Quite frankly, to waste minutes of question time taking points of order which then go to a long explanation of his argument is clearly a waste of the Senate's time. Clearly, there is no point of order.</span>

                  </a>  Thank you, Mr President. I again say the government is not making withdrawals from the Future Fund. What is occurring is the Future Fund is making a change to the type of assets it holds. The timing of the sale of assets is a matter for the Future Fund, and what the budget papers reflect is the assets the Future Fund plans to hold going forward. This is an important point. </span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The next point I wish to make—and I have put a press release out, which I assume Senator Cormann has read, but I will again say it in the chamber and perhaps he will understand it this time—is that any funds raised from the sale of non-financial assets will be kept by the fund, not by government. In other words, governments cannot spend these funds. In fact, were the government to spend these funds out of the Future Fund, under the terms of the legislation which established the Future Fund we would have to change that legislation. The government has no plans and no intention to do so. I am very happy to have a discussion about federal finances. It is a pity the opposition are so busy throwing things at the government that they cannot even look at their $70 billion black hole.</span>

That was the case under Mr Costello and Senator Minchin and it is the case under our government. But the political point that Senator Cormann is making is some assertion around the budget surplus and around the timing of the sale of assets from the Future Fund. I again say that the timing of the sale of assets held by the fund is a matter for the fund. I make this point: in our last budget we put forward $22 billion worth of savings, some of which you previously opposed and then supported. The budget is made up of the sum of many— <span style="font-style:italic;">(Time expired)</span></span>

Given that the expected revenue from the sale of assets from the Future Fund will be reflected in the $3.5 billion so-called surplus, when will the proceeds from the expected sale of those assets from the Future Fund be withdrawn from the government's underlying cash balance and returned to the Future Fund—full stop?</span>

So, frankly, the questioning here I think is predicated on an incorrect basis just as the opposition costings are. Let us remember Senator Cormann comes in here wanting to throw doubt on the government's budget figures. This is an opposition that has a $70 billion black hole confirmed by their shadow finance minister, Mr Robb, on Sunday.</span>

So the government does remain committed to those. But the government also remains committed to addressing the scourge of people smuggling and taking positive action to try to undermine the business model that sees many people risk their lives in seeking refuge in Australia. Australia remains on a per capita basis, I think, the largest contributor to the settlement of refugees in the world. Not only do we take our obligation to uphold the convention and meeting the obligation of helping resettle people very seriously; Australia has, under governments of both persuasions, a very proud record in terms of resettlement of those found to be refugees. Senator, you point to two issues that are part of the current debate about how we respond to the challenge of people smuggling and respond to the recent High Court decision. The government is aware of its obligations under both that convention and the Convention on the Rights of the Child and will be honouring those and seeking to find policy solutions that continue to reflect our strong com­mitment to those international obligations and to enact a regional response that best attacks the scourge of people smuggling.</span>

I know that this is a subject of the decision and I have read reports of it but I have not read that section of the decision closely. I do not think it is so much about a conflict of interest, but I think there are issues involved there which the High Court has commented on and obviously the government will respond to and bring any legislation before the parliament. I will not say any more than that because I do not have a brief as to the detailed consideration of that matter, but if I can get further information I will bring it back to the Senate.</span>

This Labor government is very proud that in its period in office, since 2007, it has added almost three-quarters of a million jobs to the economy. This reflects the government's very strong commitment to the creation of jobs and having that as central to our economic strategies. Senators would be aware that, in the short term, the outlook for the global economy is increasingly uncertain. Millions of people in Europe and in the United States remain unemployed and the problems in the European financial markets are having ripple effects across the world. Australia is obviously not immune from those effects, nor are we immune from the effects of natural disasters in Australia. People would be aware that the damage to the Queensland economy as a result of the floods and Cyclone Yasi has been measured in the billions of dollars. It is the case, though, that Queenslanders are getting back on their feet.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">Indeed, the Australian economy has displayed remarkable strength and resilience. Last week's national accounts figures reveal that the economy grew by 1.2 per cent in the June quarter, a significant rebound after a summer of disasters. That growth was broad based. Australian families are benefiting as a result of one of the highest participation rates in the nation's history, showing that there are more people in work. Australia has one of the lowest unemployment rates in the developed world and, whilst there was a slight uptick this month, compared with like countries such as the United States, which has a nine per cent unemployment rate, our employment market remains strong. Employment grew over the year by 1.2 per cent and the outlook for jobs is still very strong, but the patchwork nature of the economy is proving a challenge and we are seeing structural adjustment impacting on jobs in the economy. <span style="font-style:italic;">(Time expired)</span></span>

Our pipeline of resource investment alone stands at $430 billion. Based on my department's estimates, we will need 270,000 more construction and mining workers over the next five years. So there will be an enormous increase in employment in those industries. The massive investment is also leading to record highs in the Australian exchange rate, and this is having an impact on trade exposed industries, including manufacturing, tourism and international education. We understand the pressures that this is causing in the economy and that the outcomes are a reflection of genuine structural adjustments occurring in the economy. That is why the government is absolutely focused on jobs as being the core part of its response. We are absolutely focused on making sure that Australians continue to get opportunities to take new jobs in the growing economy. <span style="font-style:italic;">(Time expired)</span></span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-State">Western Australia</span>—<span class="HPS-MinisterialTitles">Minister for Tertiary Education, Skills, Jobs and Workplace Relations and Leader of the Government in the Senate</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">14:18</span>):  In this year's budget we announced the Building Australia's Future Workforce package, which is a $3 billion investment in skills and training. We are working in partnership with business and industry, investing in targeted training to ensure that we have the skilled workforce that our economy needs. To stay ahead of the game and to ensure that all Australians are able to share in the economic growth in Australia, the Prime Minister announced yesterday that the government will hold a future jobs forum at Parliament House on 6 October. The forum will bring together about 80 representatives and experts from businesses, unions, government and academia. These are people who are interested in creating jobs in Australia and in making sure that, during the structural adjustment in the economy, people have opportunities to upskill and to transfer between industries to take advantage of the new job opportunities. So the government will continue to focus on its priority of providing jobs for Australians, encouraging economic growth and greater employment. <span style="font-style:italic;">(Time expired)</span></span>

I refer the minister to the answer given by Mr David Tune, Secretary of the Department of Finance and Deregulation, that the 'expected sale of assets from the Future Fund was included in the figure for the sale of non-financial assets', in the budget. As the net cashflows from investments in non-financial assets form part of the surplus in statement No. 9 of the budget's financial statements, is the minister able to tell us whether the sale of Future Fund assets will decrease, increase or in any way affect the government's $3.5 billion surplus forecast for 2012-13?</span>

He would also see that across the forward estimates, including in the 2012-13 year, to which he has referred, the net position of investments in non-financial assets is in fact a negative on the budget. If the assertion is that there is a negative net position but somehow that is not a negative net position because it is helping you in another way, what is being asserted simply does not make sense.</span>

I refer to the comments from the Treasurer, Wayne Swan, in 2005: 'We can't have the Future Fund being plundered by the National Party. It has to be locked in a box.' Minister, does it remain the government's policy to keep the Future Fund locked in a box, or have you succumbed to the temp­tations of Ron Boswell? Are you basically robbing Peter Costello to pay Penny?</span>

I have also put out a press release. Clearly, Senator Joyce does not like reading and he does not like facts to get in the way of a good story. He is wrong. We have made clear that we are not raiding the Future Fund, we are not withdrawing funds from the Future Fund and we have no intention of doing so. He should stop coming in here and making false assertions, because false assertions are not a substitute for political debate and they are certainly not a substitute for sensible economic policy. And let me tell you that, when it comes to sensible economic policy, that end of the chamber is a complete wasteland.</span>

We did implement a review of the VET FEE-HELP Assistance Scheme as a result of a commitment given by the Prime Minister in 2008 or 2009 where we said we would look at the experiences in Victoria and undertake a review of that scheme. As I understand it, the review is being conducted by a Canberra based management consultant firm. It has been set that task.</span>

                  </a>  I will have to take on notice who has been consulted and how the review is being conducted. But I understand we have recently received a draft report for the review. I have not yet been briefed on that. We will consider those findings in the context of the discussions with the states on the wider reform of VET, as outlined in the budget. What I do know is that, from earlier advice I saw from the department, we saw quite a strong take-up in 2010, in that 26,000 students had accessed a loan to help pay tuition fees and there was good, early evidence of access by increasing numbers of disadvantaged learners. I have not seen the formal report. When I get that I will make it public. I can advise the Senate that we have undertaken, as part of the COAG process for the new National Partnership on vocational education and training, to hold a series of consultations with key industry players. I have already attended one roundtable, which will allow a broader debate on what should be included in the new National Partnership on vocational education and training as part of the COAG process. I think we do need to open it up to more input from other players.</span>

It is one of the issues that were picked up in the review and to which we will respond. I will make the broader point that this government strongly supports the FEE-HELP scheme. We think it has been one of the best things Australia has done to allow access to university education. I think there are very strong prospects for it to make a similar contribution at certain levels of VET education to assist students to be able to afford to take on the courses that will give them the best opportunities in life.</span>

Clearly if we are going to have a debate about this it has to be in the context of our strong support for the scheme and whether or not the Greens support the continuation of the FEE-HELP scheme. <span style="font-style:italic;">(Time expired)</span></span>

Last week the national accounts were released. These were further confir­mation of the underlying resilience of the Australian economy. They showed that the Australian economy grew by 1.2 per cent in the June quarter. Across Australia, people were pleased to see that the Australian economy had grown and that we are continuing to see economic growth—with some small exceptions, of course: those opposite. Clearly, the only people in Australia who were not happy to see that the Australian economy grew in the last quarter were the opposition. All they have been wanting to do is talk down the economy and try to create uncertainty and fear with a whole range of assertions which are simply incorrect.</span>

In fact, our GDP is now five per cent higher than it was prior to the global financial crisis, whereas GDP in the United States, Europe and Japan is still broadly below pre-GFC levels. So let us remind ourselves again: we have grown some five per cent since the start of the global financial crisis; comparable developed economies still have not reached their pre-GFC levels. But you would not believe that, given the gloom and doom of those opposite, who are happy to talk down confidence, happy to talk down jobs, happy to say anything as long as it is in their political interests, even if it is not in the national interest—an extraordinarily irresponsible way to behave.</span>

It is why the government's strategy has been supported by those such as the IMF. It is interesting in the context of talking about fiscal strategy to consider the opposition's position on this, which is simply all over the place. We have had this extraordinary experience of seeing Mr Hockey first saying 'It is a $70 billion black hole' and then saying 'Oops, it is not.' Then, Mr Abbott said 'No, $70 billion in fanciful.' And then Mr Robb, presumably telling the truth, confirmed the $70 billion figure. So we have Mr Abbott, Mr Hockey and Mr Robb all saying something different about the size of the black hole in the fiscal strategy of those opposite. <span style="font-style:italic;">(Time expired)</span></span>

This economic event has caused major advanced economies to have levels of unemployment in excess of nine per cent, unlike Australia, where the unemployment figure has a five in front of it. It has occupied the policymakers and the leaders of the United States, Europe and all the major advanced economies and the developing economies.

But I would say that if those opposite care so much about fiscal responsibility they can deal with their $70 billion black hole and they can explain why they voted to increase the government's liabilities when it comes to superannuation. You supported Senator Ronaldson's bill, which will increase public sector civilian and military superannuation liabilities—a decision that Senator Minchin was not prepared to come into this chamber and vote for. So you want to come in here and talk about unfunded liabilities, but you add to them yourselves by the way you vote. The reality is the opposition have no economic or fiscal credibility. They think that because they once sat near Peter Costello that gave them fiscal credibility. Well, it does not.</span>

While the government is working generally on employment and, as Senator Wong said earlier in an answer, 140,000 jobs have been created and people are able to put food on the table and shelter over their families, we are also ensuring that work is done with Indigenous employment. We are working to close the gap, creating and sustaining 100,000 jobs out to 2018. This is difficult work. While the majority of the work that will be done by the Job Services Australia providers will be done under the Indigenous Employment Program, we have identified that we need to work with young Indigenous Australians while they are still at school, making sure that young Indigenous students have a pathway into employment.</span>

It is a program based on keeping young Indigenous students in school, giving them an opportunity to learn but, at the same time as that, ensuring they get that pathway to employment. We are working with national sporting organisations, with education providers and also with Indigenous communities themselves. We are making progress. The Gold Coast Titans have set up the first of the programs. In 2010, 131 students took part in the program. So far, 84 per cent have gone on to jobs, further training or higher education. Currently there are 188 students in that program. The Brisbane Broncos worked with 41 students in 2010 and 85 per cent—</span>

                  </a>  Liberal senators may want to make fun of this, but it is an important issue and it is certainly making a change to many people's lives. In the last budget we provided $50.7 million over four years to support 6,400 Indigenous school based traineeships. These traineeships will predominantly support students in years 11 and 12, providing them with real work experience, real mentoring and real support moving forward into employment. Students are working with employers and small business. At the same time as that, the program provides them with the opportunity to make that jump into employment, and that is exactly why this program is in place. The support for mentoring, though, does not start in year 11 and 12; it starts in year 7. Funding has been put forward to support students in year 7 so they can make progress— <span style="font-style:italic;">(Time expired)</span></span>

On behalf of everyone involved, I welcome the students to Canberra and welcome the students to the week. I also thank the large number of parliamentarians, both senators and MPs, who were involved in the program. We have gone up from around 75 to over 90 MPs. Certainly the program was extremely successful over the last year and has now been increased in size. The important thing is that there are jobs in government departments, graduate traineeships and scholarships, and we want to make sure that young Indigenous Australians understand the jobs are there and get the opportunities to get access to those jobs. That is why this program is so important. I thank all the parliamentarians for their support. <span style="font-style:italic;">(Time expired)</span></span>

I would ask Senator Cash to enlighten the Senate on the way in which those opposite are actually prepared to ignore the experts who have identified quite clearly that the model that is being proposed by the opposition has failed. It has failed dismally. This is nothing but a cheap, political stunt to try to present the view that they have the answers to what are quite complex problems.</span>

We are also very clear that the opposition's policy in regard to Nauru is totally ineffective and very costly. What we do know is that the strategies pursued by those opposite—they will have their opportunity; they will get their opportunity to respond to the govern­ment's invitation. We look forward with interest to what the opposition has to say about amending the Migration Act. What we do know is that the policies that were pursued by the coalition when it was gov­ernment failed dismally and that we saw some 8,000 people encouraged to get onto rickety boats—</span>

                  <span style="font-weight:bold;">Question:</span> Minister, following on from the answers you provided yesterday in relation to the importation of New Zealand apples, did the Government receive any advice as to the withdrawal of concessions New Zealand would be entitled to impose in the event that import permits were not able to be issued by 17 August 2011? Who was the advice from and what was the nature of the advice?</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Small">
                  <span style="font-weight:bold;">Answer:</span> The WTO Trade Law Branch of the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade provided regular legal advice to the government on New Zealand's rights under the WTO Agreement in the event that Australia failed to comply with the outcome in the apples dispute. This included advice on New Zealand's right to suspend concessions in respect of Australian exports to New Zealand.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Small">Under WTO rules, New Zealand would initially need to target its retaliatory measures at exports of Australian goods (rather than services). New Zealand would have the discretion to suspend concessions on any product it wished, up to the value of the authorised retaliation. New Zealand is an important export market of Australia. In 2010, Australia's total goods<span style="&#xD;&#xA;    font-family:Bookman Old Style;&#xD;&#xA;  color:gray;">-</span>exports to New Zealand were worth $8 billion across 1153 product categories.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Small">
                  <span style="font-weight:bold;">Answer:</span> Under WTO rules, New Zealand would need to seek authorisation from the WTO Dispute Settlement Body under Article 22 on the WTO Understanding on Rules and Procedures Governing the Settlement of Disputes to suspend concessions.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Small">
                  <span style="font-weight:bold;">Question:</span> Doesn't that answer assume that what WTO agreements do is to authorise the imposition of sanctions? Don't they just authorise that concessions no longer apply?</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Small">
                  <span style="font-weight:bold;">Answer:</span> Article 22 authorises the suspension of concessions in certain cases. The suspension of concessions is often referred to as the imposition of retaliation or sanctions.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Small">QUESTION FROM SENATOR WATERS ON 25 AUGUST 2011.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Small">I took on notice some questions from Senator Waters in relation to the EPBC legislative reform package.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Small">I would like to provide the Senate and Senator Waters with some further information.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Small">Firstly, Senator Waters asked about the impacts on water systems from proposed developments.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Small">The Federal Government continues to have an important role to play in assessing projects —including coal seam gas — which are likely to have a significant impact on Matters of National Environmental Significance, including species listed as threatened or endangered.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Small">If there is not likely to be a significant impact on those Matters, the Federal Government does not have a role in the assessment process.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Small">I refer the Senate to recent comments by Minister for Resources and Energy Martin Ferguson, who stated that regulation of coal seam gas mining on farmland was primarily a matter for state governments.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Small">However, Minister Ferguson said the Federal Government is facilitating discussion at a state level on issues such as a uniform approach to the regulation of the industry.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Small">This is an appropriate and practical way for the Federal Government to play a role in helping to improve regulation of the industry, while recognising this is primarily a matter for state governments.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Small">Senator Waters also asked about the draft offsets policy released as part of reforms to national environmental law.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Small">The Senator described this draft policy as a 'move to extend the use of offsets'.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Small">I can inform the Senate that this draft policy is not about extending the use of offsets — rather, it is about increasing transparency.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Small">As the draft policy states, it is intended to give the community, proponents and other jurisdictions more certainty and guidance on how offsets are determined and applied under the EPBC Act.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Small">It is also designed to ensure the efficient, effective, transparent, proportionate, scientifically robust and reasonable use of offsets under the EPBC Act.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Small">The public comment period will close on 21 October 2011 and the government will not determine its final policy position until after it has considered public feedback on the draft policy.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Small">However, the government notes that the draft policy states that offsets are not intended to make proposals with unacceptable impacts acceptable and that offsets cannot be used to allow an action with unacceptable impacts to proceed.</span>
              </p>

              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Small">That the Senate take note of the answers given by the Minister for Finance and Dregulation (Senator Wong) to questions without notice asked by Senator Cormann, the Leader of the Nationals in the Senate (Senator Joyce) and Senator Fifield today relating to Future Fund assets.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Whatever way you look at it, the government has been caught out using the proceeds from the expected sale of Future Fund assets to help it create the illusion of an early surplus. The assets from the Future Fund are of course supposed to be quarantined from the government. The government is not supposed to touch those assets, but what is very clear from information provided by the Secretary of the Department of Finance and Deregulation, David Tune, is that the government expects to raise revenue from the expected sale of Future Fund assets and that those proceeds will hit the budget bottom line. Those proceeds will become part of the government's underlying cash balance in 2012-13, which the government wants us to believe will be about $3.5 billion.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Today we had a lot of political rhetoric from the minister. We did not have a lot of facts, we did not have a lot of actual information and we did not have a lot of answers to the questions asked, so let me recap where things are at. A spokeswoman for the Minister for Finance Penny Wong was quoted in the <span style="font-style:italic;">Australian</span> today as saying:</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Small">… more than $250 million worth of assets were due to be withdrawn from the Future Fund in the 2012-13 financial year, despite the fund having been created, by Peter Costello, under the condition it was not to be touched before 2020.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">These are not the opposition's words; these are the words of the minister's own spokeswoman, as reported by the <span style="font-style:italic;">Australian</span>. A spokesman for the Future Fund is also quoted in the story, confirming:</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Small">… the anticipated withdrawal was known to the fund and that this was the first time a withdrawal had been included in the budget bottom line.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">This of course is a government that is always desperate for more cash. It is a government that has deserted for successive deficit budgets. It is a government that inherited a position of no government net debt. It is a government that is very quickly running up to $107 billion worth of government net debt and is likely to exceed that, given the fiscal impact of recent decisions, including the $4.2 billion hit on the budget bottom line from the carbon tax and various hits from decisions in Western Australia and New South Wales to increase royalties.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Today, the minister refused to confirm the figure that was given by her own spokes­woman. Her spokeswoman said that the government planned to withdraw—the spokeswoman's words—$250 million worth of assets from the Future Fund. I ask the minister: how much of the $4.937 billion in estimated proceeds from the sale of non-financial assets in 2012-13 is expected to come from the sale of assets of the Future Fund. Given that the government has put the overall figure into the budget, the minister, if she were prepared to be open and transparent, should have provided the Senate with that figure. It is a very straightforward question. The Secretary of the Department of Finance and Deregulation let the cat out of the bag. He said that that figure of $4.937 billion includes revenue from the expected sale of Future Fund assets. The Senate deserves to know how much the government expects to collect from that. The minister also confirmed that, yes, the proceeds from that sale of Future Fund assets will hit the budget bottom line. It is part of the government's claim of an early surplus; it does form part of the government's underlying cash balance of $3.5 billion. The minister was not prepared to say when that money would leave the government's budget bottom line and when it would exclusively be held as an asset in the Future Fund.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The Future Fund has sold assets before. The Future Fund sold down its shareholding in Telstra, for example. None of those proceeds and none of those sales have ever made it into the budget bottom line. Sales of assets and purchases of assets inside the Future Fund should not hit the budget bottom line, but of course this is just, at best, another accounting trick by a government that is so desperate to claim an early surplus that it is prepared— <span style="font-style:italic;">(Time expired)</span></span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">
                  <a href="HZB" type="MemberSpeech">
                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Senator BILYK</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-State">Tasmania</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">15:06</span>):  The government is not withdrawing anything from the Future Fund. That is fundamentally incorrect. It is another false assertion by those on the other side, another part of the scare campaign that they have run constantly since they have been in opposition. They are trying to scare the people of Australia so that they will vote for them at the next election. People are not conned by that at all. As the minister said in question time, she has put out a press release asserting the fact, but those on the other side once again just do not want to know that, just do not want to hear it. As we heard earlier, it appears that the only people that are not happy with the economy in Australia are those on the other side. They do not want to know any of the good news; they just want to talk down the economy all the time. When you come from a party where you have got a $70 billion black hole, it just amazes me that you continue to talk down the economy. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The government has a very sound fiscal strategy, unlike those on the other side. They cannot even work out how to fix up their big black hole. Instead of making false claims about the budget they would do better to focus—especially Mr Robb and Mr Hockey, who cannot even get their facts aligned—on how they are going to deal with their big black hole. Ever since they have been in opposition they have been talking down the economy and doing nothing—all they have done is oppose, oppose, oppose. They have to realise that there are 140,000 more Australians in jobs than there were a year ago. That is a very important issue. The people of Australia understand that that is an important issue. I also think Mr Hockey should stop trying to avoid scrutiny by undermining the role of the Parliamentary Budget Office. If the coalition were serious about budget accountability and transparency they would support the recommended model for the Parliamentary Budget Office and the government's legislation. But, no, they cannot do that. They have to come out with a brand-new scare campaign. Every week there is a new scare campaign. The latest is that the government is going to sell off Future Fund money. As I have said, that is untrue. It is just another scare campaign from those on the other side. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The Gillard government has a sound fiscal strategy. We understand the importance of having that sound fiscal strategy and making sure that the government and the country are able to move forward. We understood that when we went into deficit to put stimulus into the economy, which kept over 200,000 Australian jobs and kept people off the dole queues. We made it clear at that time that we would return the budget to surplus, and that is what we continue to do. We laid down a budget earlier this year that has us coming back to surplus in 2012-13, and as a government we are determined to deliver on that. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">As I said, those opposite can run their scare campaigns. Today it is one thing, tomorrow it is another thing and last week it was something else. I do not think a week has gone by where they have not come up with some new scare campaign to try to make themselves look more impressive. The $70 billion black hole is the thing that people out there in voter land will remember. Those opposite cannot come up with a way to deal with it. They would rather cut pensions to Australian pensioners for two years or cut Medicare than deal with the reality of their $70 billion black hole. At the time of  the previous election, if my memory serves me correctly, they had an $11 billion black hole that I do not think they dealt with appropriately either. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Our economy is in a very strong position. It is almost stronger than that of any other advanced economy. We are weathering the global financial uncertainty, as we did the previous financial crisis. We are building productivity, we are investing in skills and education, we are investing in trade training centres and we are investing in the National Broadband Network. Those opposite did nothing for 12 years. They claim that they had this great surplus when they lost government, but they did nothing. They did not spend on infrastructure. They did not spend any money for the future of the people of Australia. They do not care what happens in future to the children of today. They just do not care. <span style="font-style:italic;">(Time expired)</span></span>

It is an interesting day. They have got the big guns out today defending Senator Wong. I would have to say that Minister Wong had a very bad day in the office today. Today was a shocker for Minister Wong. Let<span style="&#xD;&#xA;    font-family:Tahoma;&#xD;&#xA;  ">'</span>s start with her actual statement, which was: </span>
              </p>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">She said:</span>
              </p>

                <span class="HPS-Small">The government is not making withdrawals from the Future Fund. The Future Fund is simply making a small change to the types of assets it holds.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">See, $250 million—a quarter of a billion dollars—is just small change. Hell, if you dropped it at the pub on a Friday night you would not bother picking it up!</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Let us go through statement No. 9 of the budget financial statements. This is helping the finance minister out with finance. It has been ticked off; it is part of her portfolio. There we see it: net cash flows from investments in nonfinancial assets are $3.77 billion. The trouble is that that actually becomes part of the bottom line, where they end up with a $3.498 billion surplus—the magical $3.5 billion surplus. In two pages, quod erat demonstrandum—QED—it is all worked out for you. It does actually affect the bottom line. If the minister had read two pages she would have made a more concise, articulate and correct statement than the one she actually made. But the fun did not stop there. It just kept going. In answer to a question from Senator Cormann, my good friend and colleague, Mr Tune said, 'The estimates for the sale of nonfinancial assets'—we have just been through that—'include the expected sale of assets from the Future Fund.' Boom, boom! Surely not. Senator Wong said it was not so. She came into the parliament today and said it. Then we had to quiz her. Maybe she just missed it. We should quiz her on a few of the fundamental facts that any decent financial officer should know—fundamental facts that should be at your fingertips, like, for instance, how much you have got in the Future Fund. The answer to this one was a clanger. She said, 'I think we have got more than $70 billion.' She could have said, 'I think we've got more than a dollar,' or 'I think we've got more than $38.56.' But, no, she thinks we have more than $70 billion. It is just a little bit more, actually—it is $75.15 billion, if my memory serves me correctly. But who cares? What is $5 billion between friends these days? These are the most fundamental things that she cannot handle.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">It gets worse. We asked how much they have contributed—not the capitalisation of interest but how much of a contribution to the Future Fund this economic luminary and her forebears have presided over. Her answer? She will take that one on notice. She did not know how much she had contributed to her own Future Fund. We were having a bit of a laugh before because they were saying two was the number. What is so interesting about the answer to this is that it is not a number. It is not a number because it is nought—it is zero. It is ex nihilo—it is nothing. They have contributed nothing to the Future Fund. But she could not remember that she had not contributed anything, so she took it on notice. No doubt we will get an answer back later on telling us it is nothing.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Where does this leave our nation? It leaves our nation in the hands of people who are completely and utterly out of their depth. If it was any sadder you would cry. This is the person who is responsible for financial affairs—she is the finance minister. But they do not have a clue. So they run out of the chamber and put Senator Bilyk out there to defend them after questions on notice. I would have stayed in the chamber myself.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">To help out Minister Wong with a few of the figures: the government has $133 billion of liabilities to public servants. If they all retired and they all wanted their money the government would have to pay out $133 billion. But it does not have $133 billion. It has the Future Fund with $75 billion in it but if you start using that money to pay off your surplus then you are using their savings to fix up your stuff-up.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-State">New South Wales</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">15:17</span>):  The claims by Senators Cormann and Joyce and those opposite relating to the Future Fund are completely misleading and incorrect. They also demonstrate a complete lack of understanding of the operation of the Future Fund and indeed the architecture for the management of the fund that was put in place by those opposite when they were in government. Claims of accounting tricks and withdrawals from the fund are completely misleading. Those opposite fail to under­stand risk in a difficult economic environ­ment. They fail to understand a change in investment mix to reduce risk in a difficult economic environment. They fail to understand that the timing of the sale of assets related to the Future Fund is an issue for the Future Fund—a Future Fund with an independent board of guardians, amongst whom is none other than the former Treasurer, Peter Costello. They fail to understand just how this fund works. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">This also demonstrates a complete lack of credibility when it comes to economic management. This is from those opposite, who went to the last election with a suite of policies that, when costed, came up $11 billion short. Even their own auditors would not give an unqualified appraisal of their accounting for their election promises. Those opposite criticised the stimulus package that this government put in place to deal with the financial crisis and to support communities and jobs. What has happened in the wake of that? We have one of the strongest economies in the OECD and a job rate that is the envy of the United States and the United Kingdom, with an unemployment rate half the rate in those countries. We did an excellent job of managing the economy during the global financial crisis. </span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">More recently, a leak from the opposition party room has indicated that they are planning $70 billion worth of cuts to services in the lead-up to the next election. They plan to go to the election with a policy of restoring a surplus but they have failed to come clean with the Australian people about how they are going to achieve this surplus. How are they going to achieve this surplus without the revenue from the minerals resource rent tax? How are they going to achieve this surplus without the revenue from carbon pricing? There is one way they are going to achieve this perceived surplus, and that is through cuts to services—$70 billion worth.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">They will not come clean with people in their individual electorates. I have asked the member for Calare, John Cobb, to come clean with the people of Calare about what services are going to be cut in that electorate. Is Medicare on the line? Is the childcare rebate on the line? Are increases to pensions on the line? Is a reduction in the company tax rate on the line? What services are those opposite going to cut from the budget to achieve their so-called surplus?</span>

                  </a>  My points go to the issue of economic management. Economic management is at the core of the claims made by those opposite. When it comes to the issue of pricing carbon, we have seen from David Cameron, the Conservative leader in the United Kingdom, that we have got it right. We have got it right on this important economic issue. When it comes to the claims made by the opposition in respect of the Future Fund, this morning and in the parliament, they are simply wrong. They fail to understand the architecture of the fund, the independence of those who manage that fund and the need for the fund to make decisions to reduce risk on behalf of the people of Australia, whose funds are invested in the scheme. <span style="font-style:italic;">(Time expired</span><span style="font-style:italic;">)</span></span>

The reason for our suspicion is this. You might recall there used to be something called the Higher Education Endowment Fund—gone. There used to be a thing called the Health and Medical Infrastructure Fund—gone. There used to be a thing called the telecommunications fund—gone. That is billions of dollars set aside for investment in community assets and infrastructure gone, squandered by this government. They basically did a smash-and-grab raid on those three funds.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">Those of us on this side of the chamber actually take the squandering of those assets a little bit to heart, because when we came to office we inherited a $96 billion debt. People forget this, but it actually took us 10 years to pay down every cent of that debt. It was not until the middle of 2006 that all of that debt was gone. We balanced the budget, we repaid all the debt and we cut taxes. But in that situation, when you find you have a surplus, it is important to lock away Aust­ralia's good economic fortune into a fund. We set up the Future Fund. It is a sovereign wealth fund. I hear all this talk about how we should set up a sovereign wealth fund in Australia. We have one! It is called the Future Fund and you can only put money in it if you are running budget surpluses.</span>

That is galling in itself, but, when you think that this government have not put a single dollar into the Future Fund, it is even more galling. We have heard the excuse from Senator Wong—in fact she could not even bring herself to admit that they had not put a dollar into the Future Fund—and it was, 'Well, you know, the global financial crisis; it is really tough.' But we have been hearing from this government how Australia is the envy of the world, how our economy is booming and how great we are doing. You cannot have it both ways. You cannot say the economy is booming but that we cannot run a budget surplus and we cannot find money to put into the Future Fund. You cannot have it both ways.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">I think he foresaw a day when we might have a government like this in place. It is also worth recounting the very reason for setting up this fund in the first place. Mr Costello said at the time:</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">There is an important additional thing that the government must do in defending the fund—the term of the current chair of the Future Fund Board of Guardians, Mr David Murray, expires in six months and the government needs to outline the process of consultation the government will undertake when appointing a successor to Mr Murray to ensure the ongoing independence and integrity of that fund. It needs to recommit to protect this fund and it needs to make sure that the next chairman is someone who will stand up for it. <span style="font-style:italic;">(Time expired)</span></span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">

                  <a href="00AOM" type="MemberSpeech">
                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Senator SCULLION</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-State">Northern Territory</span>—<span class="HPS-MinisterialTitles">Deputy Leader of The Nationals</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">15:36</span>):  I think all of us in this place can recall a pretty significant day in the diary of this parliament, 24 June 2010, when Julia Gillard, the now Prime Minister, and Labor deposed for the first time a first-term Prime Minister, Kevin Rudd. They said that the government had lost its way. Obviously, this was Kevin 07's fault. It was a case of: 'We'll just cut his throat and slide him aside, and we're going to get back on with the job of fixing this up.' </span>

                  </a>  Order! Senator Scullion, you must refer to members of the other house by their correct title or their correct name and salutation. </span>

                    <span class="HPS-MemberContinuation">Senator SCULLION:</span>
                  </a>  I withdraw. There could be no more visible example of how badly they had failed at that stage than their border control and protection policies. When Kevin Rudd and the Labor Party won government in August 2007, I think people all around the world would have looked to the policies that the coalition government had put in place. You could say from a comparison of those policies with those of any other government that they had been a very, very effective suite of policies. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I came to this place in 2002, and I recall that in that financial year 3,039 people had arrived in 19 boats. There were 54 the year before and 75 the year before that. Certainly, it was a very serious circumstance and we needed to address it—and we did. We introduced temporary protection visas. We made sure that there was offshore processing. There were a number of regional agreements to interfere with the process of people smuggling, and they worked. This is not just on my say so. The statistic that shows this most starkly is when we went from 3,039 people in 19 boats to zero people and zero boats. I think the reason for the spotlight on us from international communities was that they were working very hard against criminal organisations engaged in people trafficking and they were looking very carefully at Australia as an example of how well they had done. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Of course, when the then Prime Minister, Mr Rudd, took over as Prime Minister of Australia, Labor simply thought the problem was solved and that they would get straight on with the job and say: 'Don't worry about those policies. After all, our motive is not that we need to protect Australia and the people who are refugees around the world from the pressures of international people smuggling. What we want to do is to make sure that we have some electoral benefit. It is not a problem for us. Things are solved in that area. The process of preferential voting means that we need to toss up whether we think about this nation's interests or whether we think about the electoral interests of the Labor Party.' Here comes the nub: the Greens and the Independents were talking about having a more compassionate approach. All the wisdom around the world said: 'No, don't do that. This is a really good set of policies that protects people, that looks after people and that ensures they don't make this very, very ugly voyage to Australia.' Immediately the policies that were in the interest of the Australian Labor Party were implemented, the border protection that was in the interest of this nation was destroyed. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">For those in this chamber and for those outside it who are listening, this is always the problem with Labor. It goes to motive. Why do you do a thing? Why do you have a policy? Is it in the interests of the Labor Party or is it in our national interest? I think more and more Australians are starting to put the ruler of motive across the policies that we see rolled out by those opposite.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">So the trade was back on. I do not know how many times I have sat in here and heard the Leader of the Government in the Senate, Senator Evans, say: 'No, no, it's not our policies that have changed it. Something odd is happening in Europe. Something odd is happening somewhere else.' Perhaps something is happening with the climate—I am not sure, because there have been a whole range of excuses. International policy makers everywhere have clearly understood that if you change this policy the consequence is a major rush of vessels. We saw that from the time Labor took over in 2007. We have gone from three boats straight up to 1,033 people in 22 boats, to 5,604 people in 117 boats and, in 2010-11, 4,949 people in 89 boats. That is a staggering endorsement of those people who said, 'When you change this policy, there will be a consequence.' Because those opposite have put their grubby paws on preferential voting for the interests of the Labor Party, they have deserted the interests of this nation. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">So we now have the situation where there are some 15 million mandated refugees around the world. As an Australian, my heart, like every Australian's, goes out to them. These are sometimes stateless people. There are 15.4 million people looking for somewhere else to be. So Australia decided that, rather than act as a single nation or country, it would be part of a group of countries—in fact, part of the United Nations process—to identify those most in need. Australia takes around 13,500 refugees, of which half are taken as the highest priority refugees in the world. A very small percentage of the 15.4 million require a refugee outcome. The UNHCR decides who those people are. At the moment, they come from the Horn of Africa. People which find themselves in camps like Kakuma in the Horn of Africa well know the reason they have been chosen as the most in need. It is that they live in the most horrific circumstances. Their life expectancy is so low compared with that of refugees in other parts of the world. I have had some staggering statistics put to me about this. Children who are under four years of age have, for a period of time, a life expectancy of less than six months. That is why they are on the priority list. That is why those people must be a priority in coming to Australia.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Importantly, the other half of the 13,500 refugees are part of the family reunification humanitarian scheme which ensures that those who are part of the refugee diaspora—after they have been flung around the countryside—are able to come together again, to join up as a family again. They are able to join their families in Australia. That is our contribution, and it is a very large contribution compared with the size of our population. Under Labor's new arrangement, we now have people coming from all over the world. If you can afford the $8,000 or $10,000 per head to get here in a boat then you have jumped the queue. The people who will not be coming here are the 6,000-odd people who are part of the family aspect of that demographic. They will not be coming here because their places have been taken by boat people—people who have simply come here. Originally, under the coalition, we sent a clear message: do not come here by boat; if you do you will be treated in exactly the same way as the place from which you left. So people stopped coming. The previous Prime Minister, Mr Rudd, came and said: 'Look we're going to change all that. We've sold our souls to the Greens—to the devil.' That is why we have this situation. Julia Gillard, the current Prime Minister, took her place and said, 'We've lost our way: we've lost our way on border protection, we've lost our way on the carbon tax, we've lost our way on the mining tax.' But, most importantly, as an iconic process, they have lost their way on border protection. Well, hello! We know that, but they said they would fix it. Kevin Rudd failed because he simply was thinking more about the interests of the Labor Party. Julia Gillard seems to be failing because she is more interested in the interests of the Labor Party than in the interests of Australia and Australians. </span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">If you want to think about compassion—and as somebody said, it is the coalition and those interested in a tough border protection policy that send the clear signal: please do not put the lives of your families at risk; the UNHCR will decide who comes to this country—then think for a moment about the men and women, but mostly about the women and young children, in places like Kakuma. If you are compassionate, then every time we weaken a policy think about their lives and how short their lives are. This Labor Party stands absolutely condemned for putting its interests and its political motives—their relationship with the Greens—above the national interest. <span style="font-style:italic;">(Time expired)</span></span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">

                  <a href="182468" type="MemberSpeech">
                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Senator THISTLETHWAITE</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-State">New South Wales</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">15:46</span>):  Immigration and border protection policy is an area of public policy that is very important, very complicated and detailed. But it is also an area that requires leadership to develop and implement a policy that ensures our nation meets the international commitments to which we are a signatory, including our humanitarian obligations under the United Nations conventions dealing with the treatment of refugees. It requires leadership to ensure a policy that provides an effective deterrent to the insidious trade of people smuggling and playing on the lives of the vulnerable and asking them to risk their lives on the high seas in unsafe and unseaworthy boats. Countries benefit from a multipartisan or a bipartisan approach to dealing with issues such as this.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Today's matter of public importance demonstrates, on behalf of the coalition, a complete lack of leadership on this important issue, an inability to analyse the recent decision of the High Court and an unwillingness to work with the government and implement a workable, effective and long-term policy solution to what is a difficult and very complex area of public policy. In the wake of the High Court's decision, Tony Abbott said:</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Small">I think that our country should have the best border protection policy that the government of the day thinks that it needs and I’m [pleased] to work constructively to give the government, to restore to the government, the option of third country offshore processing which it says the High Court and the Solicitor-General have denied to it.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">When we heard that quote from the Leader of the Opposition, those on this side thought, 'Finally we have some logic, finally we have some thoughtfulness, finally we have a constructive approach to what is a very difficult policy area, and finally we have some leadership from the coalition.' We welcomed the commitment from the Leader of the Opposition. We provided a depart­mental briefing and we provided access to the experts regarding both the immigration issues and the legal issues associated with the High Court decision. In that briefing, the Leader of the Opposition was told of the High Court's judgment and the new interpretation of the law that the High Court had given to this issue. In that briefing, the Leader of the Opposition was told of the legal advice from the Solicitor-General, which cast further doubt on offshore processing of asylum seekers—wherever that may be. Indeed, the past declarations of Nauru under the Howard government would, in all likelihood, have been invalid under this decision of the High Court. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The Leader of the Opposition was also informed that a legislative response is required—that is, an amendment to the Migration Act is required to ensure that our country has an effective long-term policy to deal with this very difficult policy issue. A number of days after the comments of the Leader of the Opposition, he began backing away from them. He began to say that he opposed a bipartisan approach to this. He resorted to type on this particular issue, he resorted to the opposition's policy of Nauru. He ignored the departmental advice, the expert advice, of those who have worked in this particular policy area for many years. In particular, he ignored the advice of the head of the department, Andrew Metcalfe, who, I note on Friday last week, former immi­gration minister in the Howard govern­ment Amanda Vanstone described as a 'first-class public servant'. Well, the Leader of the Opposition has ignored his advice showing a complete lack of leadership on this issue. In the wake of the High Court's decision, the government did what any good government would do—reacted quickly. We considered the advice of the departmental experts and the legal experts. We consulted the opposi­tion and other groups in society and, indeed, the executive consulted government MPs this morning. We have developed a legislative response that will overcome the difficulties identified in the High Court's decision. This legislative response will ensure that we continue to meet our international obli­gations in this policy area yet, at the same time, provide a very effective deterrent to people smuggling and stop people smugglers trading on the vulnerability of those seeking a better life by asking them to get on unsafe boats and undertake unsafe journeys.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The government has developed such an approach in consultation, based on the advice of experts. Yet the opposition come in here today and raise a matter of public importance in which they claim that the government has failed to find its way on this important policy issue. The only ones who have failed to find their way on this important policy issue are the opposition. Despite the advice of experts, first class public servants and the government's legal advisers in the wake of the High Court decision, they refuse to move away from their commitment to a policy that has been demonstrated not to work. It will not provide an effective deterrent. Experts have advised the government that it will not work. Indeed, 95 per cent of those who were housed on Nauru, who were found to be genuine refugees, ended up in Australia or New Zealand. This policy is not an effective deterrent.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">What is needed to deal with this issue is a regional architecture with regional consultation. We need to work with our neighbours to ensure that in our region there is an effective deterrent to people smuggling that allows a nation such as Australia to ensure it meets its international commitments and gives priority to those in need. Many of those have been mentioned in the Senate today—those in the Horn of Africa and in Burma, some of whom have been waiting in camps for 16 to 20 years.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The government's policy will ensure that we meet those international commitments yet provide a sensible, logical approach to the trade of people smuggling and an effective deterrent. The government has offered the opposition a commitment to work in a bipartisan manner on this issue. On several occasions we have said to the Leader of the Opposition, Tony Abbott, and the relevant shadow spokesperson that we will work in a bipartisan manner and that this issue requires a legislative response. That legislative response will ensure that we provide an effective deterrent to people smuggling and continue to meet humanitarian commitments that our nation has pledged to meet in a manner that will see priority given to those in need. The government stands ready and willing to work with the opposition on this important issue. We oppose the claim by the opposition in the Senate this afternoon that the government has lost its way on this issue. The opposition has lost its way on this issue. <span style="font-style:italic;">(Time expired)</span></span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-State">Western Australia</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">15:56</span>):  Senator Thistlethwaite questioned the need for this matter of public importance discussion today. I have to remind Senator Thistlethwaite: you were at a caucus meeting this morning when your own party was fighting over the absolute disarray in which your government has put border protection in Australia. Did you not read the headline in the paper today: 'Showdown: Labor rebels rally to sink Gillard's offshore asylum seeker solution'? You question why we have come in here today and raised this as a matter of public importance. Go and have a bit of a chat with Senator Cameron. See how Senator Cameron is feeling today. Have a chat with Senator Marshall. See how Senator Marshall is feeling today.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Listen to the talk that is going on in the corridors because, as a result of 24 June last year, which is now fondly known as 'execution day', there is a very good chance that the Australian public is going to revisit that day. Why? Because the Prime Minister who replaced Mr Rudd said at the time:</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Small">I accept that the government has lost track. We'll get it back on track. I have taken control for precisely those purposes.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">What an absolute joke! What did she take control of? She took control of what was a complete, total and utter mess on that side. Lo and behold, she has managed to make it even worse.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The 'current' Prime Minister—and I use that word very loosely, as I know many on the Labor side of politics do—has also gone on the public record asking the public not to judge her on the way she became Prime Minister but on the job that she is doing. If the latest Newspolls are anything to go by, from the rumours in the corridors of Parliament House—and we all know what those rumours are; in fact, lo and behold, Senator Farrell walks in right on cue—the current Prime Minister is about to become the former Prime Minister.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">In relation to so many policy failures, this is possibly the greatest policy failure of the Gillard Labor government. Who can forget Ms Gillard's catchcry when she was the shadow minister for immigration, when she used to say to the opposition if another boat arrived under our watch, 'Another boatload, another policy failure.' That was her mantra. I ask those on the other side: now that the Prime Minister has notched up a century, in that 100 boats have now arrived on our shores under her watch—and that is not a century to be proud of—what is the level of policy failure that is currently engulfing the Prime Minister of Australia? Put aside what I have to say as a coalition senator. You all expect me and all of us on this side to come into this place and criticise you. Let us have a look at what members of the Labor Party—members of the current Gillard govern­ment—have to say about the Prime Minister's mess when it comes to border protection. Senator Mark Bishop, a Western Australian senator, said to the <span style="font-style:italic;">Australian </span>online when he was commenting on the government's mishandling of its botched Malaysia solution that the 'very existence of the government itself' was threatened. And he did not stop there. He went on to say:</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Small">There appears to be continuing lack of accountability, ministers don't seem to take responsibility for their own decision-making and consequences.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The Australian public must be fully confident of the ministers on the other side when their own Labor senators are doubting their own confidence.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">But let us not stop there. Let us look at the House of Representatives. Let us see what Labor MP Graham Perrett said about the government's botched border protection policy. He said that the government needs to take time to get the policy right. You have got to be kidding me. Haven't we on this side listened to you bleat on and on and on for what is now turning into years that you had the policy right? And you had it wrong all the time. You had it wrong on every single occasion. One of your own members in the House of Representatives has at least now had the guts to stand up and say to the people of Australia that the government needs to take the time to get it right—an outright admission that when it comes to border protection policy this government is an absolute failure.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">But it does not stop there. Another Labor senator, Doug Cameron, who is the convener of the left-wing group of the Labor Party, is on the record as saying that all of those who sit around him in the Senate have become 'political zombies', too scared to speak their minds. And what did he say about the Malaysia solution, which the Gillard government today reaffirmed itself to, despite the legal advice? Senator Cameron said that the Malaysia solution was no solution at all. That is a Labor senator saying that. And I understand Senator Marshall was not far behind him. That is two Labor senators who have stood up in caucus and said that the Malaysia solution is no solution at all.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Yet we come into this place today and are subjected to unity on the Labor side of politics: the Malaysia solution is going to stop the boats. I hate to tell you this, but it has not stopped the boats yet. They continue to arrive. In fact, if you go back to your offices you will probably find that another one has arrived. But the 100th boat under Prime Minister Gillard's watch arrived post the Malaysia announcement. It is interesting that since I have been in this place there has been this constant tension between the left and the right of the Labor Party. Today we see, yet again, the Left coming in, all built up. And yet again they have to roll over. Senator Cameron and Senator Marshall have had to roll over. They have had to have their little tummies tickled. They have had to be told to be good boys and come in here and tell this place to tell the Australian public it is a solution, when they are on the record as saying it is the complete opposite.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">In addition to that, let us have a look at what the newspapers are saying about the Gillard government. If any senator wanted confirmation that the Gillard government's policies are not working and that there is massive dissension in the Labor Party ranks, they need only look at a snapshot of the headlines from the last 24 hours. The first one is 'Labor could win if Rudd returns', in <span style="font-style:italic;">Adelaide Now</span> on 12 September. I would like to know Senator Farrell's views on that, quite frankly. Were you the unnamed source, Senator Farrell? If you were, put your hand up now. The second headline is 'PM facing Malaysian deadlock', in the <span style="font-style:italic;">Australian</span> on 11 September. Then there is 'Emergency talks to head off shift to Rudd', in the <span style="font-style:italic;">Courier</span><span style="font-style:italic;"></span><span style="font-style:italic;">Mail</span> on 10 September; 'Julia Gillard seeks action as smugglers close in', in the <span style="font-style:italic;">Australian</span> on 10 September; '100th boat on Labor's watch', in the <span style="font-style:italic;">Daily Telegraph</span> on 10 September and '100th asylum seeker boat arrives for Julia Gillard', in <span style="font-style:italic;">Adelaide Now</span> on 10 September. I could go on and I could go on and I could go on.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">
                  <a href="I0N" type="MemberInterjecting">
                    <span class="HPS-MemberInterjecting">Senator Farrell:</span>
                  </a>  Please don't!</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">

                  </a>  Such is the extent of the failure of this government when it comes to border protection. I see Senator Farrell is laughing. I have to say to Senator Farrell, as someone who had his little paws all over 'Execution Day' a year and a half ago: if you thought it was bad under Mr Rudd, what do you honestly think now? This is a Labor Party that is in a complete, total and utter mess when it comes to so many of its policies, not least of which is border protection. Again, it is not just us on this side of the chamber who think that. The House of Representatives itself condemned the Malaysia deal. A motion was passed in the House of Representatives condemning the Gillard Labor government. And who supported that motion? Adam Bandt did—Adam Bandt, who as we know is in alliance with the government. The Independents Andrew Wilkie and Bob Katter, whom the government has to rely on for support, actually supported the motion, despite the Prime Minister's pathetic protestations. Under Prime Minister Gillard, Labor has an appalling record when it comes to protecting Australia's borders.</span>

It really hurts me to have to say this about my colleague Senator Cash, but to be fair to her she often comes in here and rants. But that was one of the most disappointing rants I have heard to date from you. It was a rant from one extreme to the other, talking about leadership, about misleading the public—as if those people on the other side are saints.</span>

The only time they talk about polling is when they are showing their natural arrogance, the arrogance that they demonstrate in this place on a daily basis in their belief that they were born to rule.

              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">But let's talk about this MPI. As a signatory to the 1951 United Nations convention and the 1967 protocol, Australia, the USA and Canada are the three highest recipients of humanitarian refugees in the world and have been for many years. This government is no different at all. The Howard government's legislative provision section 198A(3) was tested in the Federal Court, which endorsed offshore processing of asylum seekers. The High Court has reinterpreted the legislation and although we the government are disappointed we accept the High Court's decision. The government has already acknowledged that legislative change would be needed to put offshore processing beyond doubt. That is what our publicly released legal advice shows.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The Labor government has accepted that there are three issues: first, to break the people-smuggling business model you need to have a significant disincentive in place and take away the product that they are trying to sell; second, you need an orderly migration program to consider all humanitarian claims; and, third, we need acceptance of genuine humanitarian refugees in line with our long-term commitment. Of these issues, the Australian government has a very positive position on the acceptance of humanitarian refugees. There can be no question that this will continue, and the increase to 14,750 signals that this is so.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">But the government is committed to breaking the people-smuggling trade. We are committed to deterring people from taking these dangerous trips in boats that are rarely seaworthy. We are concerned about their welfare. We are concerned about the women, children and men who set sail for a better life. We are committed to orderly migration programs. To break the people-smuggling trade an adequate deterrent is needed. If this were not the case why would the coalition have resorted to the Pacific solution? The coalition has always supported offshore processing of asylum seekers but, in keeping with their mantra in opposition, they are about opposing, opposing and opposing.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">So, what is this motion about? It is about the fact that they are unable to accept the harm done to refugees on Nauru. Ninety-five per cent of the people were resettled to Australia and New Zealand, many suffering from serious mental conditions. They were unable to accept that the cost of reopening Nauru would be about $1 billion over four years, and that does not include the inevitable infrastructure costs. I can remember pictures of Tony Abbott at Nauru looking into a classroom pretending it was a detention centre. We know, and so does the opposition, that the processing centre in Nauru is not available for use. There is no offshore processing centre ready for use in Nauru. That is a fact. And is there anything on Nauru that would be ready for use to process 200 or 300 people? The processing centre was dismantled and the remaining infrastructure given to the people of Nauru. That is a fact. While Nauru signed the instruments of access to the refugee convention in June this year, it does not currently have legislation for determining refugee status determination and it has no experience in undertaking refugee status assessments. Nauru is isolated, and, with redevelopment, its costs would be very expensive. The opposition have been briefed by officials. Mr Abbott knows that Nauru will fail. It is not just us providing the briefing to Mr Abbott and the opposition; it is the officials, who have made it very clear that Nauru will fail. Nauru will not stop the boats. The government is committed to the Malaysian solution. This, combined with a commitment to Manus Island, will achieve the outcome that this government is looking for. The message will be: if you take a boat to Australia, you will be returned to Malaysia and processed with the 90,000 other asylum seekers and refugees waiting there. Malaysia willingly entered into this agreement, acting in good faith. The UNHCR has repeatedly said the govern­ment's Malaysian transfer arrangement was workable. The UNHCR was engaged and consulted throughout the process by Australia and Malaysia and very much helped to shape the final arrangement.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Christmas Island is an important immigration facility for this government. It also provides significant benefits for the local community, including improved infrastructure and significant employment opportunities. Meanwhile, we have Mr Abbott flopping all over the place, flip-flopping as usual. Over the last week he committed to an act of good faith, then ruled it in and then ruled it out: 'I am not ruling anything in and I am not ruling anything out.' Who does that remind me of? This change in attitude towards working positively and constructively was welcomed, but what do we find? We find, as usual, Mr Abbott going back on his word in an article in the <span style="font-style:italic;">Conversation</span><span style="font-style:italic;"></span>titled 'The vexed question of onshore processing and possible civil unrest':</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Small">If we go back to 2007 when then Immigration Minister Andrews targeted Africans, particularly Sudanese, as impossible to assimilate, that caused a significant drop in public support, particularly in Victoria, towards the settlement of refugees.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Small">It wasn’t the refugees who caused it, it was the public statements of hostility from leading political figures. As it turns out African refugees (rarely if ever boat arrivals) have proven to be generally law abiding, hard working and passionately attached to the Australia that has given them the precious gift of freedom.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I could go on and on, but what I want to put on the record is that this government is a compassionate government. We will treat refugees with respect. We will ensure that in whatever measures this government takes—and the Malaysian solution is part of that—we will endeavour to do all that we can to stop the boats. Those opposite would not accept anything this government puts forward on this issue. <span style="font-style:italic;">(Time expired)</span></span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-State">Western Australia</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">16:17</span>):  What a disgrace. What an absolute disgrace we are confronted with today: the complete and utter failure and inability of this government, led by this Prime Minister, to protect our borders. This Prime Minister is the all-rounder of failed border protection, the very person who as the shadow minister for immigration, on the rare occasion she was able to do so, would get out of the policy and say, 'Another boat, another failed policy.' And what do we have now? We have another boat, another 100 policy failures. Ms Gillard, the current Prime Minister, has now made her maiden test century. She is the Shaun Marsh of failed asylum seeker policy. The big question, of course, is whether she will go on to do more than 151 runs, as Shaun Marsh did the other day in Sri Lanka.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">But of course Prime Minister Gillard is not restricted to being a batsman; she is a bowler of the most hapless form, the hapless hat-trick. What were her three failures? Firstly, there was her failure to stop the arrival of asylum seekers; secondly, her abject failure of the so-called East Timor solution; and, thirdly and most recently, her failure in the Malaysia solution. How inconvenient are umpires when you are completely and utterly afield as a cricketer! It is far too serious an issue to be dealt with like this.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">I was in East Timor, in Dili, only five weeks ago and one of my purposes was to try and establish what I thought of the prospect of us joining with East Timor to set up an asylum seeking facility there. You would only have needed to visit to find it would not work. Those of us who have lived and worked in Malaysia, particularly under the then prime ministership of Mahatir Mohamad, would know the way in which illegal immigrants were dealt with by the government—off the end of the cane, off the end of the stick. It would be no different.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Earlier this afternoon we heard my colleague Senator Scullion referring to the 15.4 million refugees around the world. We know, as a result of the discussions over Malaysia, that more than 90,000 genuine refugees are rotting in asylum camps and refugee camps in Malaysia, and we know the story of the Horn of Africa. I have made the observation in this place before, and I believe it to be true, that there is a high degree of corruption in the actual refugee camps, where people who are legitimate refugees accepted by this country get somewhere near the top of the queue but never, ever get a guernsey. Why? Because of the corrupt payments that are going to those who manage those refugee camps from others who jump the queue and suddenly find their way. I have not yet seen any action taken by this government to investigate that shocking scenario to see if it is true.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The worst feature of the failure of this government is the increased number of unaccompanied children who are being put on these leaking, rotting wooden fishing boats and put to sea under the most horrific conditions—and we are doing nothing about it. I have reflected on a more generic term. If you wish to try and smash the business model of somebody else, how do you go about it? In this case, of course, it is the so-called business model of the people-smugglers—one which, incidentally, Prime Minister Howard and his then immigration minister, Mr Ruddock, were very successful in smashing. But, as we all know, the Howard government inherited a problem and found a solution. They handed it to the then Rudd-Gillard government, who picked up that solution and turned it back into a problem.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">If you want to smash the business model of an opponent, what are your options? The first one is to compete on better terms. Only last week we saw Clarke and Dawe parodying this situation, ridiculing this government, talking about the fact that we brought Irish and English immigrants and even convicts here in the 1700s and 1800s. Brian Dawe even asked the question of John Clarke, parodied as Treasurer Swan: 'Why don't you have a weekly ship or a monthly ship out of the Middle East?' That is the stupidity of that particular circumstance.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The second thing you would do is to make the business illegal and successfully prosecute the perpetrators. This draws me to an article in the <span style="font-style:italic;">Age</span> on 30 August. We now see in Melbourne that Victorian Legal Aid lawyer Saul Holt is telling us that they are appealing to the chief judge of the Victorian County Court to overturn the crime of people-smuggling based on the fact that although these people, the asylum seekers, have no visas they will argue that under international and Australian law genuine refugees seeking asylum from persecution should not in fact lead to people-smugglers being charged. What are we going to do—give them medals? What is interesting is that this is in Victoria. What is the proportion of people-smugglers that end up in Victorian prisons? I can tell you that it is very few. But I can tell you the answer for Western Australia, as my colleagues would know. We have 130-plus in Western Australian jails at the moment either awaiting trial or who have been dealt with, costing the Western Australian taxpayer $100,000 each a year, in excess of $13 million a year. So here is the success of my second item of the business model, making it illegal. Victorian Legal Aid do not want to make people smuggling illegal. They presumably want to put it on a pedestal.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The third that I would suggest to you if you are trying to smash the business model is convincing the consumers that the product is unattractive so that they do not want to buy it—in other words, so they do not want to come here. Taking the opposition out of the market is another option. But the fifth one—and I will deal with the third and the fifth together—is to completely change the product, change it completely, so that the consumer is disinterested.</span>

                  </a>  Thank you very much. I appreciate that, Senator Farrell. I know Senator Farrell's capacity for numbers and I would always defer to him on that particular element. But surely the circumstances from post Second World War Europe, Australia and Asia have changed such that it is time that we revisit that entire situation.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I look at what the Howard government implemented by way of finding its solution. The first measure of course was temporary protection visas, to give that level of protection to those people until such time as conditions in their home countries were such that they could safely be returned. That is something that should never, ever have been discontinued. On the Nauru solution, we hear that bleatings of Senator Carr and others saying that it never worked. The point was that it took the oxygen away from the people-smugglers. The people-smugglers could not advertise in their evil ways in Sri Lanka, Afghanistan, Iraq and other places that people coming to Australia would get to Australia. That was the point of Nauru, and it worked. It is interesting that Nauru was run by Australians. It would be most interesting to run a poll of people who have been found to be not genuine refugees: would they like to go to Malaysia under Malaysian manage­ment or would they like to go to Nauru to a facility under Australian management? It would be most interesting to see what the outcome would be.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The other thing we did under the Howard government was forge a strong, positive relationship with Indonesia. Think back to the tsunami when this country sent $1 billion to the people of Indonesia at a time when their Islamic brothers in the United Arab Emirates could only come up with $1 million—and only when it was shamed afterwards did Saudi Arabia kick the can to some very limited effect. What we see in this country now in the circumstances of our relationship with Indonesia, which I will not dwell on today, is a very upset relationship with that country. What level of cooperation is Australia likely to get with the government of Indonesia at the moment on matters associated with asylum seekers and border protection given the fact that we treated them so harshly in the months of June and July this year?</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The Howard government eliminated the pull factors. Even Minister Bowen has accepted at the moment that what we have done in this country is create those pull factors and we are going to continue to see an increase in the numbers to come. Then Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs Philip Ruddock said the safest thing to do was to keep people off the boats. This government has failed. This government is unable to protect Australia's borders. It must go.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-State">Queensland</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">16:27</span>):  I rise today to make a contribution to this debate about migration as well. I want to, firstly, indicate that it is one of those areas that I have spoken about on numerous occasions in this chamber and it is an area that can be highly charged and unfortunately at times politicised. Unfortunately at other times we see the creeping of xenophobia into the discussion. It is an area that needs to be critiqued in respect of what it is about.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Before I get to the relevant points, I want to make comment on some of the previous contributions from speakers from the opposition. Firstly, Senator Scullion spoke about the Horn of Africa. There is a terrible situation happening over there. That is why we need sympathetic and reasonable management of how we protect our borders and deal with those poor souls who come from situations that we are aware of in the Horn of Africa.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Senator Cash spoke about reports of headlines in the newspapers about what is happening in our caucus today. Yes, there was a caucus meeting today where metho­dically and reasonably the members of the Labor caucus worked through a process of discussing this issue. At the end of the day, we worked up and supported a solution that will see an outcome of presenting legislation to the House of Representatives and eventually to this chamber for a resolution on how we deal with migration.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">It really astounds me how not just Senator Cash—I do respect Senator Cash; she is a good performer from the opposition—but in general most of those people in the opposition here will tend to rely on the media. I guess that is why there is a campaign out there currently wanting some reform in the media. I will give just one example of why you cannot always rely upon the media. Just last week, I was quoted in the <span style="font-style:italic;">Age</span> as having made some comments about the introduction of or the support for the Nauru solution. It was not even me in the photograph; it was a colleague. That clearly demonstrates that those opposite should never rely upon media headlines in the newspapers.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We know that there has been a High Court decision in relation to our Malaysia solution, which has been dealt with. Subject to that decision, we need to work out future positions on handling migration and border protection. That is why, in caucus today, we had a discussion dealing with this particular issue. The High Court judgment established a new interpretation of migration law, which is why we need to work through a process of managing this. Legal advice from the Solicitor General cast further doubt over offshore processing of asylum seekers, wherever it might occur. It could be anywhere in the Pacific that we as a government decide in the future to deal with this issue. Indeed, talking about Nauru under the Howard government, the Solicitor-General has indicated that, most likely, that decision would have been invalid as well. This is an opportunity for the opposition to work with us in a bipartisan way to make sure we get a solution, because one day in the future they may be in a position where they might be in government and they will need to deal with this issue.</span>

                  </a>  There is no use in playing politics on this issue, Senator Back. You need to deal with migration in a methodical, reasonable and responsible manner, rather than coming up with cheap slogans like, 'We will stop the boats.' You know, Madam Acting Deputy President, that I, as chair of the defence subcommittee, take a strong interest in defence matters. It was only last year, in July, that I was very fortunate to be on the parliamentary defence program at the border protection command in Darwin. On that day, it was actually the day on which the Prime Minister was on HMAS <span style="font-style:italic;">Bathurst</span>, we went out into the harbour and saw firsthand how our hardworking, professional men and women on that ship deal with this issue. Low and behold, one of the opposition members of the House of Representatives, the member for Dickson, just had to ask the question. You do not have to be a rocket scientist to work out what the answer would have been to his question, which was: 'Why don't we just stop the boats? Why don't we just turn them around?' We are in the middle of the ocean somewhere, we cannot see land for miles around us, and here is the member for Dickson asking a stupid question like that. I knew what the answer would be, and sure enough it was: 'If you go around trying to stop the boats, the first sign of an Australian naval patrol boat will result in those people drilling holes in their hull, damaging their engines or do anything they can to make sure they are rescued.' We are dealing with desperate people. We are dealing with people who are coming from areas where they are persecuted, or where there is war or conflict, and you have these grubby people-smugglers getting them over here in any possible way, shape or form, whether it be in a leaky ex-fishing boat, whatever the case may be, regardless of its condition. We all watched, sadly, on our TVs last year as SIEV221 smashed up against the rocks on Christmas Island. I do not want to see that scene again and I am sure everyone in this chamber feels the same. That is why we need to work together on a solution to this issue.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Regardless of what the opposition does when this legislation comes into the parliament, it needs to reflect on its position, because at some stage in the future it will need to deal with this. It is not a case of coming up with cheap political slogans such as: 'We will stop the boats,' or 'We will pick up the boat phone and ring someone in Canberra who will deal with this issue.' You need to work through a humane solution and deal with it using a logical process.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I will focus on Nauru for a moment. We know that, as a result of that solution, somewhere around 60 per cent of those who were resettled from Nauru were resettled in Australia, and that a whopping 95 per cent of people resettled from Nauru ended up in Australia or New Zealand. It was not an outcome that worked, despite what those opposite would have you believe. It did not work. The reality is that 95 per cent of those people were resettled in our country and in New Zealand. We know that, not long ago, the member for Cook and also Mr Abbott visited Nauru and inspected what is a dilapidated migration centre. They came up with the view that it would have a significantly lower cost than the Malaysia solution. We know that is also not true; they have got it wrong. It will not be cheap or effective. It will be more costly, because of the changes that will need to be made on Nauru. That is why we as a government will not consider Nauru has a possibility in the legislation we introduce to deal with this issue. In fact, the highest level of Department of Immigration and Citizenship estimates are that the coalition's Nauru plan would cost taxpayers $980 million, almost $1 billion, in operational costs alone. That is $1 billion that could be spent elsewhere, on health or education, rather than refurbishing a centre that is basically inoperative.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Once again Mr Abbott needs to decide, for the sake of the coalition as an alternative government, to work with us on this issue. Migration to this country has always been an issue. I remember, back in the 1970s and the 1980s, when the Vietnamese boat people arrived on our shores. I still dread to remind myself of some of the redneck statements such as, 'Why don't we get the Navy out there and blow 'em out of the water.' I am certain that is not what the opposition is advocating, but it certainly stirred up xenophobia in our community. We need to make sure that those sorts of comments and views are oppressed and that we deal with this issue as a government—and as a government we can.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This is a very important part of the process of scrutiny and accountability for the National Broadband Network. Senators will recall that this is perhaps the largest infrastructure project ever undertaken by any Australian government, certainly in recent times. Senators will also recall that, in spite of repeated requests by the coalition, there has still not been a cost-benefit analysis of this project.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">With the new paradigm in government, and the last election result being so close, the Independents, as part of their agreement with the Gillard government, indicated they wanted greater accountability and scrutiny. A deal was then done so that a Joint Committee on the National Broadband Network would be established with roughly equal numbers of government and non-government members. It was then deter­mined that Mr Oakeshott would become chairman of that committee. I stand to be corrected if I am wrong here, but I suspect that was part of the deal in dividing up the spoils of office for the new government. The terms of reference of this committee were that the committee would more or less take the place of the cost-benefit analysis and would generally look at all aspects of this huge expenditure of taxpayers' money. I continue to say—justifiably, I think—that this is a project which will involve in excess of $55 billion expenditure of taxpayers' money and that it therefore should be very clearly scrutinised by the parliament on behalf of the Australian taxpayer.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The NBN Co. has already been given extraordinary exemptions from parliamentary and regulatory oversight. These include an exemption from review of the Public Works Committee of parliament. That is quite unusual for an expenditure of this amount of money on infrastructure. The passing of the telecommunications legislation amendment bill limited the ACCC's oversight of commercial agreements undertaken by NBN. There is, as I have mentioned, a lack of any cost-benefit analysis by the Productivity Commission or any other competent agency to examine whether the objective of universal and affordable broadband was most cost effectively and speedily achieved by the NBN project. There has been a failure by the government to release the 400-page NBN corporate plan in full. We have got bits and pieces of it but not the full 400-page document. It has also been exempted from freedom of information laws. Therefore it was essential that this joint standing committee set up to oversight the NBN should have the powers to do that. I am a member of the committee and to date we have been stymied in getting the full information that we need to properly assess the NBN and its rollout. In fact, NBN Co. has applied for the right to increase prices on most services, excluding the basic ADSL speed equivalents, by up to CPI plus five per cent per year. By comparison, the price of access to Telstra's copper network has fallen seven per cent each year in real terms since 2000, and figures compiled by the OECD show that between 2005 and 2010 the price of ADSL broadband in Australia fell by 69 per cent in nominal dollars. The recent history of broadband connection shows a downward trend, a falling of prices, but the NBN is seeking permission to increase its prices by CPI plus five per cent per year over the next several years. It appears to the coalition members on the committee—and this is mentioned in the dissenting report of coalition senators—that the government equity injection is explicitly structured to hide the inherent risk of the NBN project from taxpayers and investors in other communications companies, in breach of the competitive neutrality principle supported by both Labor and the coalition until quite recently.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I want to comment on a number of aspects of the joint committee's work, although time will not allow me to deal with all of them. I draw the Senate's attention to the coalition's dissenting report, which outlines a number of problems with the NBN rollout. I will not go into this in full—our report sets out evidence of these problems in some detail—but there have been ongoing delays in the rollout. That is mentioned on pages 62 and 63 of the report. There are also difficulties with what are claimed by NBN to be confidentiality provisions that really do restrict the ability of the committee to fully oversight this infrastructure rollout. There are a number of other issues that I would like to emphasise but, as I say, time will beat me. I do suggest that anyone interested in this NBN rollout have a look at the coalition's dissenting report. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Perhaps the worst problem that I found—and I was disappointed that although I was supported by my coalition colleagues the majority of the committee did not support me when I raised it—was that we wanted an oversight committee to at regular times be given details of how many kilometres of fibre had been rolled out this week or this month, how many connections had been made, how much money had been spent, how much money had been drawn down by the NBN from its government facilities—the sorts of things that we would have expected as an oversighting committee, looking at the expenditure of some $55 billion plus of taxpayers' money, we would be able to get as a matter of course. We are being told by NBN and the government—and regrettably the committee chairman sided with the government—that this sort of information is not regularly available. As I said at the meeting, surely Mr Quigley, the NBN chief, every week gets a report from his people telling him how much has been rolled out and how many subscribers have been connected. They must have that information—why is it not being made available to members of this joint committee that is supposed to be oversighting the whole procedure? We were given some excuse that to my mind did not seem to have any validity whatsoever. It is disappointing that the committee which is supposed to oversight this massive government expenditure of taxpayer funds is not able to do its job because it is not getting the full information that we thought it might be entitled to.</span>

                      <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Senator BIRMINGHAM</span>
                    </a> (<span class="HPS-State">South Australia</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">16:49</span>):  I join Senator Macdonald in seeking to have the Senate take note of the first of what are designed to be regular reports from the Joint Standing Committee on the NBN—a committee that, like Senator Macdonald, I am a member of. This committee was intended to be the primary body of the parliament to have oversight of this truly massive area of government expenditure. Let us be under no illusions—the government and Minister Conroy like to proclaim just how significant this project is. We may debate the merits of the project, we may debate whether it is as significant to the future of the Australian economy as Senator Conroy and others opposite sometimes claim, but there is absolutely no debate about the significance of this project for the Australian budget and for the finances of the Australian government. You need only look at the fact that in just this financial year, in the 2011-12 financial year, NBN Co. will receive a $3.1 billion cash injection from the Australian government. That is just this year—just one year of many, many years of multibillion-dollar commitments from government into NBN Co. This year alone, more than $258 million a month of taxpayer expenditure is going to this project. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">You would think for that sort of money, especially for that sort of money funded as it is out of taxpayer debt—money borrowed in the name of the Australian taxpayer—there would be a decent level of accountability. That is what this committee was established for—to provide some parliamentary accountability; to provide some parliamen­tary oversight. But it is a disappointment, as Senator Macdonald highlighted, that we are unable to provide the level of oversight which is warranted. We are unable to do so because we have been unable to extract from the multibillion-dollar NBN Co. the most basic of key performance indicators at this very early stage of the committee's deliberations. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">A body that has more employees than it has customers is somehow unable to provide a parliamentary committee with the bare bones basics, not even the basic KPIs which might tell us exactly how much money has been provided to it at a given point in time by the Australian government; to tell us how much of that money has been expended at a given point in time by NBN Co.; to tell us on what that money has been expended—how much of it has been expended on massive executive salaries for its bloated workforce versus how much has been expended on actually rolling out fibre or delivering the wireless or satellite options that are also being developed under this proposal; to tell us how much fibre has actually been rolled out; to tell us how many homes or premises that fibre has passed; to tell us how many premises have actually agreed to have that fibre connected; to tell us, ultimately, at a given point in time, how many premises have taken out a service which utilises that connection; or to tell us how many customers this new, multibillion-dollar government monopoly actually has. No, the whole thing is shrouded in secrecy. The whole thing has failed to provide basic answers or to meet the most basic standards of public accountability that we should expect—that we should demand—for the expense of far less taxpayer money than we see NBN Co. expend. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Senator Macdonald was right to highlight, as the dissenting report by coalition members of the NBN joint committee also highlighted, the areas in which NBN Co. has been given some extraordinary exemptions from public accountability already—very extraordinary. Despite being the nation's single largest public works activity, it has been exempted from consideration by the Parliamentary Standing Committee on Public Works. Those opposite may argue that that is why this joint committee on the NBN Co. was established instead. If that is the case, this joint committee should get the types of answers, information and data that the Public Works Committee has long required in helping it determine the worth and merits of Commonwealth public works. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We have seen limitations on the power of the ACCC to oversight NBN Co.'s activities. So this reform, which is meant to be and is argued by those opposite to be a great reform for competition in the telecommunications sector, has, for its success, demanded limitations on the power of the nation's competition watchdog to oversight it. They have actually put a choker chain on the watchdog, telling it, 'No, you are not able to ensure competition in a manner which we would expect to be mandated for a new monopoly enterprise.'</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">There has, as we know, been no cost-benefit analysis or any decent analysis whatsoever of the merits of the NBN Co.—of whether it meets the basic threshold test of being the best, most affordable, most effective and most cost-efficient way of delivering fast broadband to Australians. As the Deputy Chairman of the Productivity Commission, Mr Michael Wood, observed in evidence to this committee—and this was highlighted in the dissenting report:</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">As a general principle we continue to believe that cost-benefit analysis is a useful tool. We also make the point that you do not actually rely exclusively on the numbers that a cost-benefit analysis will produce because it is the product of many assumptions. As long as it is a transparent process of identifying the various costs and benefits and it is transparent as to the assumptions that you have made—and there are very many complex assumptions to be made in these things; they are not simple, but they are an instructive methodology—then that is a useful contributor to decision making.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">For whatever reason, those opposite decided that having any type of independent analysis of the merits of this multibillion-dollar expenditure was not a useful contributor to their decision making. Far better it was for Senator Conroy and Mr Rudd to sit on the VIP plane and get out the back of an envelope and say, 'This is going to be a worthwhile project,' and announce it to the Australian people from there. Far better it is, they think, to exempt this project from the application of freedom of information laws—once again stifling the accountability that we should see for such an expense of government funds.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Even with regard to the project itself, and even with the limited information from NBN Co. that the committee has been able to work with, we are aware of the reality that prices for all but the most basic level of service will go up and will be higher than has been the case under current arrangements in the telecommunications sector. Consumers who want more than a basic service offering in the broadband space will end up paying more and more over the long run.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We know as well that there are delays to the rollout. We do know that they are not getting the job done on time and that they are not able to let contracts in a manner which ensures the project can be delivered within budget. We know that, in the first lot of major contracts put out, they had to go back to the drawing board and have a second try because nobody came in within budget. Even last week, after this committee had reported, it was revealed that in my home state of South Australia they have had to go back to the drawing board again—they have not been able to let the first major contract for delivery in SA. So we have a situation now where NBN Co. has construction contracts in place in all mainland states—after a couple of goes in some of them, mind you—except for South Australia. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">There is no clarity from this government, no clarity from Senator Conroy or from NBN Co., about why SA is the only state where NBN Co. has not announced a contract for fibre rollout. There has been no explanation of what the cost and timing implications of that delay are. How long will South Australians have to wait to see this magical NBN Co. rolled out? And how much more will it cost the Australian taxpayer to roll it out as a result of these contract failures and as a result of these delays? There is no guarantee that people in South Australia will receive the same percentage of fibre services or whether, because of these contract failures, more South Australian premises will end up having to rely on wireless and satellite options than in the rest of the nation. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Why? Why are there no answers to any of these questions? Because the whole project is masked in secrecy and because the government does not want the truth about the costs and expenses and failures of this project, as highlighted in this dissenting report, to come out. I seek leave to continue my remarks.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">The response of the chairman of the ACCC to the Senate motion concerning the anti-Israel BDS campaign against Max Brenner chocolate cafes is, to say the least, disappointing. I also note that this motion was opposed by Greens senators. Since Greens leader Senator Bob Brown took his alleged robust line against Senator Rhiannon's support for the boycott divestment and sanctions campaign, BDS, in the March New South Wales election, Senator Rhiannon has repeatedly needled him on this issue.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">After the backlash against the Greens at the March New South Wales election, particularly in the seat of Marrickville, Senator Bob Brown lambasted Senator-elect Rhiannon. Senator-elect Rhiannon's first reaction had been to suggest that the Greens should have done more to explain this issue. She said:</span>

                <span class="HPS-Small">Collectively, we didn't do enough to amplify support for BDS and show that this is part of an international movement.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">Senator Bob Brown publicly accused the New South Wales Greens of having mistakenly taken to:</span>

              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Small">... having their own shade of foreign policy. I've had a good robust discussion with Lee. She and I, not for the first time, have engaged in a very frank discussion about the way the New South Wales election went.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">Days later, Senator Bob Brown said:</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">Then a month later in her blog she threw down the gauntlet, declaring that:</span>

              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Small">Despite the intimidation, misinformation and abuse in recent months directed towards the Greens NSW, my colleagues in Marrickville and myself, I will not step away from speaking out for Palestinian human rights.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">Intimidation? To whom she could she have been referring? She then took issue with Senator Brown's assertion about the Greens National Council rejecting BDS:</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Small">It is not accurate to say that the Greens National Council rejected a BDS proposal.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Small">…          …          …</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Small">… there was no vote to reject it. A less stringent boycott was supported.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Small">…          …          …</span>
              </p>

                <span class="HPS-Small">… The argument that the NSW position is a contravention of the national policy does not stand up.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">When the <span style="font-style:italic;">Australian</span> put to Senator Brown Senator-elect Rhiannon's declaration that there had been no national Greens vote against the BDS, he then changed his story. He said:</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Small">There has been no vote in favour of the BDS proposal.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">That, of course, is in stark conflict with what he previously said, namely that it had been rejected. But Senator Rhiannon repeated her assertion at a Politics in the Pub event in Sydney in July:</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Small">One of the pieces of information was that the New South Wales Greens were going against the national policy so the boycott was not in contravention of our national policy. There is a diversity of opinion only about how we take forward the Greens's position.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">That begs the question: misinformation from whom? To whom could Senator Rhiannon be referring? In a motion in the Senate after Senator Rhiannon's arrival, Senator Brown squibbed the opportunity to vote against the BDS. In fact, Senator Brown has voted against anti-BDS resolutions in the Senate on numerous occasions now, notwithstanding his declaration on <span style="font-style:italic;">Lateline</span> that he did not support the BDS policy. After their public spat following the New South Wales election, Senator Brown seems to have been at pains to appease his new senator on BDS, but to no avail.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Meanwhile, Senator Rhiannon keeps pushing the boundaries on BDS. Last week while supporting the boycotting of Israeli businesses like Max Brenner's, which do not acknowledge the Palestinian cause, Senator Rhiannon placed a use-by date on her commitment not to push the BDS campaign in the Senate:</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Small">I am quite aware that Bob Brown has a different approach on this, that within the federal parliament there isn't the support for this issue at the present time, but in the wider community there is growing understanding about the need to take a stand for Palestinian human rights, so I am not taking this into the Senate at the present time.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We will see how long that lasts. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Finally, I should not fail to congratulate brother David Cragg from the Victorian Trades Hall for finally telling the truth to BDS proponents in the union movement regarding flaws in the logic and integrity of the BDS strategy and the totally repugnant history of boycotting Jewish businesses. I would simply urge the Greens, yet again, and anybody out there who has concerns about the Palestinian cause not to go down this ugly path of boycotting Jewish businesses. The world has been there before, and surely we do not want to go down that path ever again. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">With all the background that I have just provided, one wonders why the ACCC has failed to take decisive action given that the activities are clearly designed to hurt those businesses. I understand that Senator Boswell will be expanding on that aspect. I thank the Senate. </span>

                  <a href="YE4" type="MemberSpeech">
                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Senator BOSWELL</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-State">Queensland</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">17:08</span>):  It was very disappointing to get a letter today from the trade practices commissioner, Mr Sims, saying that he wanted to do a Pontius Pilate on a particular motion that the Senate had carried. In that letter the chairman said: 'We are not going to investigate this because it is unlikely to have had the effect of causing substantial loss or damage to the business of Max Brenner such as to constitute a contravention of section 45D of the act. Relevant here are the infrequent nature of the protests, their limited duration and the consequent difficulty in apportioning the revenue impact of this activity versus other factors.' He then goes on to allude to the Victoria Police as doing the job for us anyhow. I do not accept that. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I think Mr Sims is only a new boy in the role of trade practices commissioner. He should take more seriously a resolution of this Senate when it is backed by people representing 90 per cent of the population of Australia. Sure, the Greens do not support it. But the Liberals support it, the Nationals support it, Labor support it and the Independents support it. They all supported the motion that I moved on 18 August. Mr Sims simply says, 'It does not do the things that it should do.' Let me point out to Mr Sims that last week in Sydney there was another demonstration, another picket, another boycott and more intimidation of a Jewish confectionary shop. No-one in Australia wants to go down that path. We have been there before, as Senator Abetz said. It sends shivers down people's spines that we could even contemplate doing it. Yet the trade practices commission turns its back and will not investigate it.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I have maintained an interest in the ACCC and the Trade Practices Act. Since the prosecutions of unionists in the seventies for secondary boycotts, it has been clear that section 45D applies where there is a real chance or possibility that boycotting conduct will, if pursued, cause loss or damage that is more than trivial, minimal, insubstantial or novel. It concerns me very much that in its media release the ACCC exonerates the BDS campaign. With respect to secondary boycotts, the ACCC applies a much higher standard to those sometimes violent protests than the standard the courts have applied consistently to the AMIEU, the TWU, the CFMEU and even to the peaceful activities of milk vendors. I can remember a group of dairy farmers wanting to get together to negotiate on a price with the manufacturers, and they were barred. This was a group of innocent dairy farmers who just wanted to sit down and talk about prices. The ACCC came down on them like a tonne of bricks and said, 'Not on.' I had to seek an exemption. It is going back some time now, but that cost a fair bit of money. If the ACCC can do that to dairy farmers, surely it can get off its tail and try to do something that will stop these boycotts. This is completely unsatisfactory. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">There should be no excuses for Mr Sims. He should use the same criteria as he does for secondary boycotts by unions and other businesses that seek to meet and have discussions—but apparently we have a separate set of standards. Mr Sims says: 'Don't worry about it. Victoria Police will do it.' Sure, Victoria Police might do it and they should do it and they have done it—and good luck to them. They have done it efficiently and effectively, but we expect that sort of reaction from the ACCC and we are not getting it, and we should get it. I say to Mr Sims: 'People in this parliament do not casually pass resolutions for you to ignore. When a resolution passes this parliament, it has the support of all senators other than the Greens. It represents about 90 per cent of the population, who want you, the ACCC, to take some action.'</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I have moved another motion today. It will be the fourth that I have moved. Every time I have moved them, Senator Brown has said he does not support the BDS and will not support the BDS, as Senator Abetz said. We have tested him time and time again. This will probably be the fourth resolution. He sits over there, but there is no doubt in my mind who is running the Greens at the moment. It is Senator Lee Rhiannon. She has come in here and changed the Greens from a benign sort of environmental party to a hard Left Socialist Alliance party, and that is what people have got to understand. You are voting for someone that is supporting a boycott on Jewish businesses. So when you vote for the Greens, you are not voting for a benign green party; you are voting for a party with racist views. They say: 'We are going to boycott. We are going to picket. We are going to intimidate anyone who wants to shop at these Jewish businesses.' That should make people who think they are doing the right thing by voting green think twice when they vote for a green environmental party. The Greens do not want to do the right thing. The Greens want to intimidate Jewish businesses. This is 1939 revisited. This is how it starts—</span>

There is no doubt that the anti-Jewish sentiment in Germany in 1939 started off with the boycott of Jewish businesses, and it went further and further until the holocaust. For a point of order to be raised suggesting that somehow that can be airbrushed is simply unacceptable. That is the established history.

Tomorrow, Senator Brown, you have one more chance to redeem yourself, because a motion will be put up tomorrow congratulating one of your members—an MLC in New South Wales, I think. He has come out against the BDS. I will be asking the Senate tomorrow to congratulate him. You either have to congratulate him and condemn Senator Lee Rhiannon or condemn this MLC and congratulate Senator Lee Rhiannon. It will be interesting where you go.

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-State">Queensland</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">17:19</span>):  I also am concerned about the response from the commissioner. I would have hoped that the commissioner might have placed some great weight on the fact that the resolution to which he was responding was in fact a practically unanimous resolution of the Senate. I also want to reinforce Senator Abetz and Boswell's view that boycotts of Jewish businesses are repugnant to any democratically minded Australian. I acknowledge that a feature of the Australian democracy, in our easygoing way, is that people are free, within certain very confined grounds, to say anything and to participate in demonstrations and strikes. That is the way we are in Australia. We would never want that taken away so that we were not free to express our views and our opinions. But there is a concern that this involves Jewish businesses. It brings back the perceptions, understandings and a view of history—as Senator Abetz mentioned. These are not subjective comments; this is the history. In Germany in the 1930s through to the 1940s, and to a lesser extent in some other European countries, action was taken against busin­esses solely on the basis that the owners of those businesses happened to be Jewish. I cannot quote but I know enough about German history during the 1930s to know that both Hitler and Goebbels would have had reasons which they would explain to the public of Germany as to why the activity in Germany at the time was not being dealt with in a way in which Australians and most freedom-loving people around the world would have responded. I know enough of Goebbels's history to say that he would have given an explanation and if you wanted to believe it you could easily have done so. The incident to which Senator Boswell referred and which he has been passionate about for some time involves the boycott of a business on the sole basis, as I understand it, that it is Jewish. At a cursory glance, maybe it does make a point about some incident that is happening overseas. But here it is the sort of explanation that Goebbels would have given. He would have given it glibly and cleverly, as most propagandists do. In Australia at this stage of our history, or at any stage, we do not want to allow our country to be involved in any sorts of boycotts that impact on people's businesses, their livelihoods and their ability to act freely because they happen to be Jewish people. I am not as familiar with all of the ins and outs of the Greens political party as Senator Boswell clearly is. I know he has followed this very closely because he is passionate about it. I cannot quite work out what the Greens' view on this issue is. In fact, I have to confess that—</span>

                  </a>  Senator Williams says, 'They don't know themselves,' but I was going to go on to say that I quite often find myself with that same problem with the Greens. The party—not individuals, I hasten to add—is full of hypocrisy on most of the angles they approach. I cannot wait to speak on something that is coming up very shortly in the Senate, the Tasmanian logging issue, and I know Senator Abetz, Senator Colbeck and others no doubt will want to have a few words on that.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">To me, the Greens are hypocritical in their policy approach to many things, but it does appear from my very limited understanding of the Greens' approach to the issue of boycotting Jewish businesses that there are certainly contradictory and conflicting results and approaches. I suspect many of the broader membership of the Greens would want to boycott Jewish businesses for reasons that they would justify to themselves. I appreciate that Senator Brown—whilst I have little respect for his policy approach, I do have some respect for his political cunning—realised that this particular issue cost the Greens a seat in the New South Wales parliament at a recent election. Senator Brown realised that the party in New South Wales was on a course which most New South Welshmen found repugnant. He stepped in to try to, as Senator Boswell said, 'airbrush' that out of the policy of the Greens political party.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We have to be clear and unequivocal on this. I am, as I say, disappointed that the commissioner responded in the way that he did. I would have hoped that this was such an important issue, an issue that received almost unanimous support from this chamber for the ACCC to look into it, that there might have been a different response. I have not been able to fully study Mr Sims's explanation of why he did not but I would have thought it was such an important issue that the comments that Senator Brown and Senator Abetz made on this particular issue would warrant a very serious consideration by the Chairman of the Australian Competition and Consumer Commission.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I conclude by again saying how proud I am of Senator Boswell, who has raised this, and my other colleagues. I know it is an issue that Senator Abetz has very strong views on as well. I know that many in the government also have very strong views. We must never allow Australia to be placed in a situation where businesses are attacked, where people's livelihoods are attacked, where their freedom to do what everyone else in Australia can do is impeded upon simply because the owners of those businesses happen to be of Jewish extraction. We must never let that happen in Australia. Anything that we, the ACCC or Victoria Police can do to stop that is something that should be encouraged and supported.</span>

I wanted to get to the matter at hand, which is a reference, through the President and requested by Senator Boswell, to the ACCC to take action and investigate alleged secondary boycotts against Max Brenner et cetera. The ACCC has said it closely examined the issue and has rejected it. There is no further action to be taken by the ACCC. It is taking a watching brief and finds that effectively Senator Boswell has been wasting its time and wasting this Senate's time on pursuit of a failed political point. Senator Boswell has been a complete failure on that score. The ACCC is the arbiter of that, not I.

                <span class="HPS-Normal">The coalition has a very proud and long history of supporting timber workers, especially Tasmanian timber workers. So when the Greens, through their increasingly faltering leader, moved their ill-considered motion asking about coalition support for the Tasmanian timber industry, we on the coalition side were of course very happy to oblige and support the motion. The President of the Senate rightly communicated the motion to me. I responded by indicating:</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">

                <span class="HPS-Normal">Guess what? Labor and the Greens, having supported this motion, have still not come up with a suitable allocation of time for us to be able to discuss this issue in this place.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The Greens motion is right, to a certain extent. The excellent stewardship of the Tasmanian timber sector by the coalition does need to be told, and I look at Senator Macdonald, who had stewardship for many years. The coalition has a proud record and we are more than happy to talk about it. But where the Greens motion fails, like its leader, is in the pathetic and disingenuous attempt to pin on the coalition, somehow, the loss of jobs in that sector in 2011, three years after we lost office and one year after the Labor-Greens alliance got their fingers on the levers of government. I agree with the Greens: our stewardship was good, indeed very good, especially under Senator Macdonald. But to ask that our good legacy somehow should be able to protect the industry and reach forward for three years and more to protect people against the onslaught of the Labor-Greens alliance was expecting too much even from us, the coalition. The fact they thought we might be able to do that was kind of them, but even good coalition policies cannot protect an industry, or the budget for that matter, from the wrecking policies of a Labor-Greens alliance.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The coalition's support of the timber industry in Tasmania saw the integrated Southwood plant. It saw the Ta Ann plant in southern Tasmania and in Smithton, a plant the Greens now demonstrate against using the tag of it being 'Malaysian'. One wonders why they have to use that tag, but it might hark back to the previous motion that they will always try to play that particular card. But what is the evil of Ta Ann? Ta Ann are now converting re-growth logs that used to go to woodchip into peeler logs and veneer. If ever there were a value-add to a low-priced timber, it is this. So, what do the Greens do? They chain themselves to the ships that export this veneer. They chain themselves to trucks and try to denigrate the reputation of Ta Ann.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">But that is what the Greens always do. They say they want downstream processing. Well, we delivered funds for that to occur. What do the Greens do? They demonstrate against it. But in their motion the Greens, surprisingly, ask us for an explanation as to the closure of woodchip mills in 2011. Guess which woodchip mill closed in 2011: the Triabunna woodchip mill that Senator Brown's mate bought. You know the mate, the one who gave him $1.6 million in donations. Then, Gunns finally sold to Senator Brown's donor at $6 million below the going price. When a consortium of Tasmanian timber industry bodies got together to try to buy this mill for $16 million, they were gazumped by these greens, Mr Wood and Ms Cameron, at a price $6 million below the asking price. Why the quickness? Well, we now know, don't we? It was because Senator Brown's mate agreed not to operate this woodchip mill until such time as Gunns got compensation for exiting native forests. It was a commercial decision Gunns took of their own volition some time ago. So here we have the spectre of the Australian Greens actually supporting taxpayers money going to Gunns. Why would that be the case? Because as part of the deal Gunns said, 'You cannot operate Triabunna until we get taxpayer funding.' So we have the bizarre spectacle of the Greens in Tasmania and the Greens up here in Canberra cooperating, and I must say, Senator Feeney, it is disappointing to see federal Labor and state Labor agree to this—agreeing that taxpayers money will now go to Gunns. Gunns will now get a lot more money than if they were to sell the Triabunna woodchip mill for $16 million. But as we were told by Mr Wood he saw his donation to the Greens as a good investment—and yes it is paying off to the tune of $6 million here—and Senator Brown said in response to the donation that he would be 'forever grateful'.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">But despite the efforts of the Greens and Labor the industry now needs the injection of $276 million in an attempt to close it down, to buy it out. So if you want to complain, as the Greens did, about our support to the tune of $240 million, the Greens are there to the tune of $276 million, not to enhance the industry but to close down an environ­mentally sustainable, wealth-creating, jobs-rich industry. I ask the Greens, as I did on <span style="font-style:italic;">Q&amp;A</span> the other night: tell me of a country that does forestry better than Tasmania and Australia. And we never get an answer. The reason is that there is no such country. We have a very proud record in this area. When they close down Tasmania's native forest industry they can sit proudly by knowing that the timber needs of Australia are now no longer being supplied from within Australia but from South-East Asia and the Pacific Islands, whose record on forestry is so much superior to that of Australia! That is why I say to my friends in the Labor Party, 'Be very careful when you join up with the Greens.' I seek leave to continue my remarks.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Small">The Deer Industry Association of Australia has requested on behalf of the deer industry to re-apportion the deer slaughter levy due to a significant production decline over the last 10 years, which has reduced the funds raised through the levy.</span>

To meet this request, a change to legislation is required as the Act currently caps the NRS component at 4 cents per kilogram.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Small">The deer industry requires the NRS component of the levy to be increased to 6 cents per kilogram to ensure it generates sufficient levy funds to maintain a viable residue monitoring program. Australia requires a residue monitoring program for European Union market access, and with ap­proximately 85 per cent of all venison produced in Australia principally exported to the European Union, it is a key market for the industry.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Small">When a person is seeking to access their preserved superannuation benefits on compassionate grounds, they can apply to the regulator for a determination that an amount of their benefits can be released.

                  <span class="HPS-Small">Administration of the function involves the operation of a call centre and assessing and ruling on each application for release. This function does not fit well with APRA's legislative role as the prudential regulator of the Australian financial services industry. The Government considers that this function would be administered more cost effectively by an agency which deals with other elements of income support and has an efficient customer support infrastructure.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Small">Medicare Australia is currently undertaking the general administration of early release on compassionate grounds under delegation from APRA. Administration was outsourced by APRA through a service agreement between APRA and Medicare Australia. As a consequence, Medicare Australia has gained a comprehensive under­standing of the function ahead of the formal legislative transfer.</span>

                      <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Senator RONALDSON</span>
                    </a> (<span class="HPS-State">Victoria</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">17:52</span>):  In the four hours since we last spoke about this matter, I have had some interesting information to hand. Clearly the matter that the parliamentary secretary raised in relation to the RSL and their lack of support for schedule 2 was correct. I also have a letter. Honourable senators will remember that basically it is the RSL, Legacy, the Vietnam Veterans Federation and the Defence Force Welfare Association who have expressed concerns about schedule 2. I will read to the chamber the following letter from Tim McCombe, the President of the Vietnam Veterans Federation:</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I confirm that the VVFA has not seen the complete explanatory memorandum—</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I received this at 2.42 today—</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">Our main concern with schedule 2 is that the amendment wording would give the Repatriation Commission almost complete discretion in offsetting matters. The wording would allow it to determine almost without restriction what constitutes the elements of its decision making. It goes much further than confirming a previous practice. Whilst the wording in the explanatory memorandum may inhibit the abuse of the amendment by the Repatriation Commission, it cannot guarantee that such an abuse will not occur even now or particularly in the future. In the case of such abuse, explanatory memoranda are not consulted in tribunal and court hearings unless there is ambiguity in the wording. There is certainly no ambiguity in the wording of these amendments. Offsetting is a basic feature of our compensation system. It is far too important a process to be largely left to regulation and the goodwill of bureaucracy. We remain strongly opposed to schedule 2 of the bill in its present form.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I was then advised that at 5.01 this evening—and I remind honourable senators that we commenced debate on this matter at 10 am this morning—the Vietnam Veterans Federation received for the first time the full explanatory memorandum. What a remarkable abuse of what should be good process. This is an organisation that the parliamentary secretary knows curries no favour for anyone in politics. They play their politics hard and they play fairly. If you are doing something that they do not agree with, they will let you know. They do so without fear or favour, as the minister knows and as I know. This is not some partisan group that has entered this debate. This is a group that historically, as I said, have only acted in the best interests of their members. They are not a party-political organisation. I think they pride themselves on the fact that both sides of politics keep on accusing them of supporting the other side, which is a pretty fair indication that they are doing something right. They were not given—and I hope the Greens are listening to this—the full EM until 5.01 this evening. I said to the parliamentary secretary that he cannot possibly tell this chamber that that is appropriate. I invite him to do so when I finish.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I told the parliamentary secretary this morning that if Legacy, the Vietnam Veterans Federation and the RSL were supportive of the schedule on the back of the amended explanatory memorandum then we would support schedule 2. Well, none of those organisations support this new EM having now had the opportunity to look at it. On that basis, we will not be supporting it. I now invite the Greens and their spokes­person—who apparently ticked off on this amended wording on the basis that she thought it was going to resolve some of the issues—having been told that these organisations do not support this new EM, or that it does not allay their fears, to vote against it. For the Greens to do otherwise indicates that this has been a political decision and not a policy decision. How else can it be interpreted? Their spokesperson herself said this morning that she supported this new EM on the basis that it would allay the fears of the ESOs. Well, it does not. So on that basis they cannot possibly support it. Therefore, I invite them again to support us in relation to the schedule. None of these groups support this amended explanatory memorandum. They still have the same concerns. The Defence Force Welfare Association does not support schedule 2, even with the amended EM. The RSL does not support schedule 2, even with the amended EM. The Vietnam Veterans Federation does not support schedule 2, even with the amended explanatory memorandum. Surely this chamber is not going to proceed with approval of schedule 2 while those organisations are still concerned about it.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I will give you some of the evidence that came through in the inquiry by the Senate Foreign Affairs, Defence and Trade Legislation Committee into the Veterans Entitlements Amendment Bill 2011. In his evidence at the public hearing on Thursday, 11 August, Rear Admiral Ken Doolan said:</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">I think the current arrangements give the answer. The current arrangements are the ones with which the Returned and Services League is comfortable. We have lived with those and explained them to our members. That is why we do not see the need for schedule 2.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Senator Fawcett then asked:</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">With the increasing number of people deployed in operational service at the moment, obviously there is potential for an increasing number of people to require compensation. Is it your opinion that these changes to the legislation could disadvantage any currently serving members in years ahead?</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">To which Rear Admiral Doolan answered:</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">That is what we have said.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I say to the Parliamentary Secretary for Defence and to the Greens spokesperson: if you vote against my amendment to remove schedule 2 you are effectively telling this chamber that you know more about this matter and have better judgement than have the RSL, the Defence Force Welfare Association and the Vietnam Veterans Federation. That is effectively what you are saying. You are saying that they do not know what they are talking about and that you are going to override their wishes on this matter.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">It is worse for the Greens, the government's partners in crime. They have signed up to an amended explanatory memorandum which they say was going to resolve the issues of the ex-service organisations. Guess what? It does not. So how can you possibly provide the government with succour in relation to the schedule 2 vote? It would be an act of gross hypocrisy, were the Greens to support the government in relation to the schedule. As others have said, the government indicates on page 327 of Budget Paper No. 2:</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">The Government will clarify offsetting rules for veteran compensation under the <span style="font-style:italic;">Veterans' Entitlements Act 1986</span> (VEA), at a cost of $2.7 million over four years.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">…   …   …</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">The Department of Veterans' Affairs will also improve the administration of offsetting cases through case manager training and enhanced systems support.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">During the public hearing, Senator Fawcett asked the department to explain their statement versus their claim and the minister's claim that the amendments affect no-one and will have no cost. It is either one of the other. If, indeed the RSL, the Vietnam Veterans Federation and the Defence Force Welfare Association are right, and there will be potential impact, you cannot proceed with schedule 2.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">As the parliamentary secretary knows, the amended explanatory memorandum does not have the force of the act. The act will be interpreted on the back of the plain language in the act. The EM will not in any way supersede that. The parliamentary secretary knows that as well as I do. That is the concern of the Vietnam Veterans Federation and the RSL. They know that full well, the parliamentary secretary knows that and the Greens spokesperson should know that. Get your systems in place. We support your systems, but do not, please, treat the ESOs with such contempt, when they have quite clearly indicated to you that, despite this amended EM, they are still extremely uncomfortable with this schedule. The parliamentary secretary and minister know that we do not need this schedule at this time. By the department's own words, there is not a current issue. If there is not a current issue, is this not about getting the processes right rather than changing the law, potentially to the detriment of serving men and women and ex-service men and women? When you have been alerted to the issues that the ESOs have got and you know full well that there is no urgency at all in relation to this matter, when you know full well that you are in the process of having further discussions with the department, which I presume will include the $2.7 million IT expenditure to 'improve the administration of offsetting cases through case manager training and enhanced systems support,' do that. And if you need to come back to this place for some legislative imprimatur in relation to what you find, let us talk about it then. Let us have a talk at that stage. Let us have the ESOs in a position to make some judgments about what you may or may not have found through the system and what the legislative requirements are, because no-one believes that this is required at this time. They say there will be an impact. You say there will not be. If your case is that there will not be, we do not need this schedule at this time. Get your systems in place, come back here and we will see whether this requires legislative change. As all these ESOs have said, they are not prepared to compromise a piece of legislation which they say is working at the moment for regulation which they say will not. <span style="font-style:italic;">(Time expired)</span></span>

                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">The proposed amendments will not change the current operation of the compensation offsetting provisions. The changes are intended to clarify the operation of the legislation following the Smith decision and ensure that the established compensation offsetting practices can continue.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The decision of Commonwealth v David Ronald Smith was an interpretation of section 30C of the VEA in respect of incapacity from injury. I think Senator Ronaldson and others have fairly set out the circumstances of the Smith decision. We know that the court found in favour of the respondent, Mr Smith. The Senate committee report on this, which I thought was a very fair summary, states that the court: </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">… formed the view that the Commonwealth’s submissions failed ‘to give sufficient weight to the complete operation of section 30C, in particular the reference to ‘incapacity from that injury' as found in section 30C(1)(c)'  … The court decided that in Mr Smith's case, it had not been appropriate to offset 'because the condition for which he was granted disability pension was a different condition from that compensated at common law'.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The report further states:</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">The government was of the view that this decision of the Full Federal Court underlined the need to clarify this aspect of the legislation. In its Portfolio Budget Statements for 2011–12, the government indicated that … it intended to amend the offsetting provisions in the VEA. In its submission, the department explained further:</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;        margin-left:&#xD;&#xA;      11.35pt;&#xD;&#xA;        &#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">It is considered that the decision of the Full Federal Court that offsetting should not have occurred applies only to the unique circumstances of Mr Smith's case. These included that, with the agreement of the Commonwealth, the common law claim for compensation was expressly changed to remove the two conditions that were being compensated under the VEA.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">Nevertheless, the Government decided to amend the offsetting provisions of the VEA to ensure that the legislation is clear in its intent.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">It stated further that if passed the amendments 'should avoid the likelihood that, on the basis of the Smith case, those seeking future compen­sation payments could circumvent the offsetting provisions by exclusion of specific injuries or diseases from the terms of the compensation settlements'.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">So there are a few aspects of that in relation to this very first paragraph of the addendum to the explanatory memorandum. Firstly, is it anticipated that there will be changes, if not to the current operation of the compensation offsetting provisions in a direct and strictly technical sense then in the way that compensation settlements are drawn up, given what the government is seeking to do with the amendment to schedule 2 of the act? In other words, it has been anticipated, has it not, to directly quote from the department, that, 'those seeking future compensation payments could circumvent the offsetting provisions by exclusion of specific injuries or diseases from the terms of the compensation settlements'? Is that what the amendment will do in the context of how schedule 2 will operate? Given what the department has said, won't that in some way change the current operation of the compensation offsetting provisions, if not in a strictly technical sense then in a practical sense? </span>

                    </a> (<span class="HPS-State">South Australia</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">18:13</span>):  I thank Senator Feeney. If it will not change the way the compensation settlements are drawn up, why is it that, in its submission, the department stated that if these amendments are passed it 'should avoid the likelihood that, on the basis of the Smith case, those seeking future compensation payments could circumvent the offsetting provisions by exclusion of specific injuries or diseases from the terms of the compensation settlements'? Does that not mean that, by virtue of these amendments, it will have an impact on the way the compensation settlements are being drawn up, because it is making it clear that certain forms of compensation settlements will no longer be acceptable by virtue of the passage of schedule 2? That is a direct question. The purpose of my questioning is not to criticise the government in terms of the policy intent or what the department has said, but it does seem to be somewhat at odds to the government's addendum to the explanatory memorandum and what the department itself has said in relation to this particular issue. </span>

What gives rise to the same incapacity is a medical question. The Smith decision, although unique, casts some doubt on this operation, and if different injuries give rise to the same incapacity—that is, the same effect of that condition—the basis on which the veteran is compensated may not be offset. As a result it was felt that the legislation needed clarifying.</span>

The terms of compensation settlement agree­ments must be part of the current operation of the compensation offsetting provisions. If I am missing something or the parliamentary secretary thinks I am being a dodo on this he should tell me—I will not take offence. It seems to me there are two contradictory statements. I do not know whether the shadow minister has a particular view on this, but I would have thought that there seems to be a contradiction between what the department is saying and what the addendum to the explanatory memorandum is saying.</span>

The first asserts that longstanding custom and practice in this area is being preserved and clarified by the amendments in this bill, and it is because offsetting has always been based on the same incapacity that we are trying to ensure the interpretation of provisions does not change over time. </span>

                    </a> (<span class="HPS-State">South Australia</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">18:20</span>):  It seems I have been confused all along. It is already in my disclosure of interests, but I have been a lawyer for a few years and I did virtually nothing but injury law. I am not saying I am familiar with this area of law, but the government has said that there is some confusion on my part because I have confused the issue of incapacity and the issue of compensation. Guess what? If you have a bigger incapacity, you get more compensation. That is how it generally goes. So it might not be the case that incapacity and compensation are distinct issues. Usually the level of incapacity, depending on how it is assessed, is tied to the level of compensation. Does the government concede that there is a nexus between the level of incapacity and the level of compensation the recipient could receive?</span>

The Smith case pointed to a possible way to circumvent these provisions, and we are preventing that. In that way these amendments are preserving custom and practice.</span>

                    </a> (<span class="HPS-State">South Australia</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">18:22</span>):  I just want to get a concession from the government that there is a distinction between what the department has said and what the addendum to the explanatory memorandum says. The parliamentary secretary, always eloquent, has stated that the government wants clarity as a result of the Smith case, even though it refers to that case as being 'a unique set of circumstances'. The practical effect of the so-called clarity that the government is seeking as a result of the Smith case is to deal with those who would circumvent, according to the depart­ment, the offsetting provisions by exclusion of specific injuries or diseases from the terms of compensation settlements. The addendum to the explanatory memorandum, though, says:</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">The proposed amendments will not change the current operation of the compensation offsetting provisions.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Surely, if you have a situation where the department is saying, 'We need to get some clarity on this,' as the parliamentary secretary has rightly pointed out, as a result of the Smith decision, that will have practical consequences. There will be circumstances where, as a result of that so-called clarity, settlement negotiations or settlements that have been reached will be affected, because they now will be excluded as a result of schedule 2.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">That seems to me to be inconsistent with the statement by the government that the amendments 'will not change the current operation of the compensation offsetting provisions'. They will do so. To say that they will not is inconsistent with what the department has said about this. The government could call it 'complementary', but does it concede that there are circum­stances where settlement arrangements that may be allowed now under the current legislative scheme will not be allowed pursuant to what is proposed in schedule 2, because there will not be an opportunity to circumvent the offsetting provisions by exclusion of specific injuries or diseases from the terms of compensation settlement? I just want to get a concession that that is the case. It is consistent with what the department says but it seems to be inconsistent with the addendum to the explanatory memorandum.</span>

The level of incapacity does go, obviously, to the level of compensation. The nature of the incapacity is, therefore, a basis of compensation. But the Smith decision talked about 'injury' not 'incapacity', thus giving rise to the potential to circumvent the settlement. So the government does not concede the point.</span>

                    </a> (<span class="HPS-State">South Australia</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">18:25</span>):  The parliamentary secretary has acknowledged what the department has said—that there is an issue about circumvention of the offsetting provisions by excluding specific injuries. The parliamentary secretary has drawn a distinction between incapacity and injuries, but I think that we know that, generally, the more incapacitated you are, for whatever reason or from whatever injuries, the more compensation you get. The department made this statement in their submission to the Senate inquiry:</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">… the amendments should avoid the likelihood that, on the basis of the Smith case, those seeking future compensation payments could circumvent the offsetting provisions by exclusion of specific injuries or diseases from the terms of the compensation settlements.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">In an operational sense—in a practical sense—does the parliamentary secretary agree with that statement? If he does agree with that statement—and this may give him some comfort—I think most people would say that, on a plain English interpretation, that is inconsistent with the addendum to the explanatory memorandum, even if the parliamentary secretary does not say it. So I would be happy now for the parliamentary secretary to acknowledge that what the department has said is an accurate reflection of the government's position.</span>

                    </a>  No, that is certainly my word, Senator; I concede that—between the department's work and the wording of the EM. To address myself to that point: the government maintains that the department's position to the committee is not at odds with the EM. In fact, we continue to maintain that they are complementary. The amendments to the legislation to maintain current arrangements are to ensure that the Smith decision—that is, the decision of the full bench of the Federal Court—is not used to circumvent the current provisions by excluding some injuries or diseases where the incapacity is the same under more than one compensation source. </span>

Chapter 19 is the guide that determines the rate of pension for a veteran. The government included reference to chapter 19 in the explanatory memorandum to alleviate the RSL's concerns that there may be an overlap and to ensure that these will remain separate processes in line with current practice.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This has no relationship to the terms of a common law settlement that might be used. This is used where possible to separately identify the relative contribution of each condition to an incapacity and then assess the appropriate rate of compensation. This is based on medical advice. However, it is not always possible for medical practitioners to assess the relative contributions of different conditions, particularly where the symptoms of the conditions substantially overlap. Where it is not possible to apportion the impairment from a non-accepted condition from the incapacity assessment, the offsetting provisions are used. Chapter 19 is never used together with offsetting; it is one or the other. </span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">An example of how the Smith decision might impact current arrangements is this. As you have noted, Senator, the decision was concerned with different injuries or diseases even where the incapacity is the same. These amendments ensure that no matter how the injury or disease is described, if the incapacity is the same, compensation offsetting will continue to apply to ensure that a person cannot be compensated twice. These amendments clarify the longstanding current position. They ensure that someone who simply labels two conditions differently is not compensated twice when the incapacity is clearly the same—for example, a back sprain and lumbar spondylosis.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Offsetting is about fairness. It ensures that individuals get the same amount of compensation whether or not they get compensation from only one source or from more than one source. I hope that assists the senator.</span>

                    </a>  Synergy; that is right. If someone has a back sprain and/or a spondylosis can the parliamentary secretary explain whether there will be doubling up, because I see them as quite distinct conditions? One is a pre-existing condition but it means that you are more vulnerable to the effects of an injury in the event that you have a back strain than someone who does not have that pre-existing condition. The way that workers compensation, or indeed common law, has worked for many years across a range of jurisdictions is that effectively you take your victims as you find them. If somebody, as a result of having a pre-existing condition, is more vulnerable to a greater level of incapacity than someone who did not have that pre-existing condition in similar circumstances of trauma then that clearly would be relevant. I would appreciate it if the parliamentary secretary could indicate what he meant by the reference to spondylosis and back strain.</span>

                    </a> (<span class="HPS-State">South Australia</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">19:36</span>):  But there is a difference, though, because from a compensation point of view, if someone has a back sprain without having a pre-existing condition, that is quite different from someone who has a back sprain with a pre-existing condition of spondylosis because a person who has a back strain with spondylosis would have a more significant incapacity by virtue of that pre-existing condition. There could be circum­stances where a person who sustains a back strain in the absence of a pre-existing condition such as spondylosis is able to continue to work, might have a bit of pain and is suffering a bit of discomfort but has no incapacity; whereas, if that person has a pre-existing condition such as spondylosis, the potential for incapacity, the potential for that person not to be able to work, the potential for that person to have a long-term ongoing disability that would otherwise have been quiescent but for the strain by virtue of that person's spondylosis is quite different. So I am not sure how that would work in the context of the practical application of schedule 2. I am not sure if Senator Ronaldson, representing the coalition as the shadow minister on this legislation, would have similar concerns. I do not know whether spondylosis and back strain is the most elegant example or the most useful example, but maybe I am wrong. </span>

The point I am making here, Senator, is that a person should not and will not be rewarded for labelling the same injury differently. To borrow your phraseology in terms of double dipping, it depends on medical advice as to whether the incapacity is the same. It is something that will be determined by the compensation regime and it will be determined by that regime in the longstanding way that it has always been so determined. </span>

Are you aware that the department noted the significance of the findings in the 2009-10 annual report by observing that there remain different views on the extent and application of the Smith decision? Is this legislation relating to the nature and extent of the application of the Smith decision, or is it a lack of clarity that you are effectively talking about in this schedule? </span>

I presume that then makes sense, because if it were only a one-off decision then that would lead the department to say that there will be no impact following on from this legislation. I do not want to spend all night on this—that is not entirely true. I would be happy to do so because it is a matter of great seriousness. I am very anxious to see schedules 1 and 3 go through but I do not want to continue this debate longer than need be. The concern of the ESOs, the ex-service organisations, and their refusal to support schedule 2, even on the back of this, is that they see this as a transfer from the parliament to the department. Parliamentary Secretary, do you at least acknowledge that is the nature of the concern of the ESOs, that that is what is driving it?</span>

Parliamentary Secretary, are you aware of this comment from Rear Admiral Doolan: 'What we are saying is that we seek clarity, and we see schedule 2 as bringing a degree of lack of clarity. As I said in my opening remarks, we see the current status as allowing for offsetting and being reasonable and we have no difficulty with the current arrangements'?</span>

In relation to that, Parliamentary Secretary, I need go no further than the addendum to the explanatory memorandum, which makes it clear that the Repatriation Commission will be issuing appropriate policy guidance to staff of the Department of Veterans' Affairs. Indeed, that is the issue the ESOs have—that you have transferred the policy decision-making process from this place to the department. There is established offsetting legislation and practice, and effectively what you are doing is transferring that out of here to the department. Senator Xenophon, this is probably coming to a close and there will be a division shortly.</span>

With respect to the concerns of the RSL, and indeed the Vietnam Veterans Federation and others, we continue to maintain that their fears are unfounded and that in fact these improvements to the legislation will work to the benefit of all stakeholders, including ESOs.</span>

                    </a>  Yes, he is, as are all the people I work with. I am just lucky, I guess. Concerns have been expressed and it is fair to say that the ESOs have concerns about this—and I want to put this in language that is as neutral as possible—and that they are resigned to this going through, as I understand it. I want to put on the record Senator Wright's role in this. It is fair to say that her role has been quite useful in providing some clarity to the situation. Senator Wright undertook a conciliatory role in this to try and get a better outcome—and this is not a criticism of Senator Wright; on the contrary, it is an expression of gratitude for the work that she has done on this. If Senator Wright's role had been allowed to continue to bring in the RSL, Legacy and the Vietnam Veterans Federation, I wonder whether we could have avoided several hours of agonising debate about this particular issue. In fact, if that process had continued it might have brought some real benefit. Schedule 2 has some work to do. I think that is clear from the language of the department in its submission to the Senate inquiry, and I have referred to that repeatedly. My question to the parliamentary secretary, which I hope—and I think the parliamentary secretary hopes—will be my last question to him, unless he wants more, is this : will there be any monitoring of the practical effects of schedule 2 in terms of claims that are being dealt with differently, claims that are being rejected, fewer payments made, and what I think are shorthand ways of the government's concerns about so-called double dipping, although, depending on the circumstances, there may be a dispute as to whether in fact there is double dipping? What reassurance can the parliamentary secretary give that the implementation of schedule 2 is being monitored and reported, apart from, say, the estimates process, where of course we have the opportunity three times a year to scrutinise this? Is there any other mechanism or assurance that the government can provide, other than questions on notice, the estimates process and questions without notice, about how it works?</span>

Let me see if some other initiatives can give you comfort. Firstly, as you will be aware, and as has been reiterated in this debate today, this is part of the motivation for upgrading and enhancing the IT systems and information systems that are available in the department. Above and beyond that, there is a continued consultation with ESOs to allow for their input and, notwithstanding claims to the contrary, the department obviously focuses very heavily on its consultation processes and structures with ESOs. Lastly, there are ongoing regular monitoring and consultative forum arrangements so that the department and its leadership are completely permeable to concerns that might exist in the veterans community or elsewhere about the operation of this legislation and departmental systems that support it.</span>

I was tempted by his response—not by the inadequacy of it; it begs another question. If the ex-service organisations—the RSL, Legacy, the Vietnam Veterans Federation and other organisations who represent those who have served our nation—express concerns to the government about the practical implementation of schedule 2, will the government agree to some form of formal or semiformal process of convening a meeting of those organisations to thrash out any particular concerns they have in relation to this?</span>

But your question in some ways is 'How long is a piece of string?' The point and, I guess, the reality is that the department and I understand—and I am about to make commitments on behalf of my colleagues and I am sure they will take an interest in what I am signing them up for—that in this particular policy space the relationship, in my view, between the department, the minister and the ESOs is an organic and continuing one. The simple fact of it is that if schedule 2 does create anything like the concerns you are describing then, yes, the minister and the department would respond. I do not know whether that would require a new consultative structure. I wonder if those that exist might be up to the task of managing such a conversation, but certainly the government would continue to have a responsive approach to its stakeholders.</span>

Is that not the logical step? You are going to put the cart before the horse by having the schedule and then trying to address it later on. You have acknowledged that there is no urgency for this and that the process is going to be addressed by the $2.7 million. I ask this question: would you give the ex-service organisations an undertaking that if, as it says here, 'ex-service organisations will be consulted during the development of this material'—that is the appropriate policy guidance—and they are opposed to that material it will not become policy under this addendum to the explanatory memorandum?</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I have previously spoken in relation to this. This addition to the bill would give veterans of British nuclear tests the ability to claim for a gold card for health costs. Earlier today I referred to the need to do so, and I do not propose to unnecessarily restate that. I referred to Canon Peter Patterson, who contacted me after his application for the gold card and disability pension were denied. He was commissioned by the Australian military forces to serve at Maralinga, South Australia, for a period of 87 weeks between 1956 and 1963 as an Anglican chaplain. Mr Patterson's claims have been fraught with difficulty, because the current rules are unfair. A delegate of the Repatriation Commission was not satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that the cirrhotic arthropathy was related to his service. We know from the medical evidence that those who have been exposed to British nuclear tests have suffered greatly. The rates of death and disability have been significant.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I am particularly grateful to Senator Macdonald's contribution on this. He quite rightly pointed out what is being done for the children of the veterans of British nuclear tests who have been born with disabilities and significant health issues. I commend Senator Macdonald for raising that, because it is an issue that cannot be ignored. I do not believe it has been dealt with adequately by Australian governments, both past and present.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This amendment is one that deals with the gold card being given to the veterans of British nuclear tests. These men and women went to Maralinga, to Emu Fields and to Montebello and were subjected to nuclear testing without anyone telling them what the health implications would be. They have suffered, much like any veteran who has been injured in war and they should be able to access all the health services they need to treat their cancers, their skin conditions and their depression. I believe this is the right thing to do.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The second reading amendment Senator Wright and I moved was lost. I do acknowledge the work that Senator Ludlam has done on this previously and the concerns that have been expressed in relation to this. But we have really dropped the ball when it comes to our veterans of British nuclear tests. There are fewer than 2,000 alive right now. They are dying off at too rapid a rate. We know that successive Australian governments have done very little to help them. We know from a media release from the law firm Stacks/Goudkamp on 29 July 2011 that Australian veterans of British nuclear tests hopes for compensation have been boosted by a UK court decision. The hopes of hundreds of Australian military veterans of British nuclear tests seeking compensation from the UK Ministry of Defence got a boost after a significant victory in the Sydney courts, because the UK Supreme Court ruled that it would allow the veterans to argue their case that they were not out of time in bringing their action. Even if veterans are successful Stacks/Goudkamp made the point that if the Supreme Court allows them to go ahead they will still have to argue their negligence case against a determined UK Ministry of Defence. Why do they have to do that? Why do they have to go down the path of seeking redress in the British court system? Why can't we do what other nations have done and provide a statutory system of compensation? The Americans, Russians and Chinese have done it for their nuclear test veterans, but here in Australia it seems we have to go cap in hand to the UK courts for an uncertain outcome and expensive, time-consuming and uncertain system of seeking justice.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Senator Macdonald has quite usefully asked me whether a costing has been done on this. We know this, and I think it is a very reasonable question. The coalition, as did the government, unfortunately opposed even a second reading amendment that would say 'let's do some costings on this.' I urge the coalition and the government to reconsider that. It is important that there be appropriate costing of that. But I still move this amendment, because I believe the principle is fundamentally right, because here we have a limited pool of people—fewer than 2,000—and what we are seeking to give them is not a pension as such but access to the gold card for health benefits, so that they do not have to go through a burden of proof in showing that they are eligible.</span>
                </p>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This is what some of the veterans have said:</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Small">This is an absolute disgrace. All the other illnesses that's brought on by exposure to radiation, we don't get treated for and that in itself is justice denied. So the real thing is the recognition, full recognition, under the Veteran Entitlements Act, but they won't recognise Maralinga as being a dangerous zone that we served in.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Small">The only thing I can assume is that stalling for time is waiting for us all to die and they won't have to give anybody anything.

                  <span class="HPS-Small">Successive governments have ordered another inquiry or another committee to be set up. Sometimes they take three to five years. That's another three to five years. In that time another 10 percent of the veterans are dead. Well, given another five years, there won't be any of us left, quite frankly.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">That is why we need to at least acknowledge this, to give these veterans access to Gold Card entitlements.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This is not a radical move. This is not an expensive move. We are looking at a very small and diminishing class of people, yet we have treated them with contempt. Subsequent Australian governments have treated these people with contempt. They have served their nation. They served it in a very dangerous zone where nuclear tests were carried out, and that is why this requested amendment seeks to redress that, in part by giving them access to the gold card. It is extraordinary that the government and the opposition do not support the costing of this. They were worried about setting some precedent or about what other implications it would have. But these people deserve justice. Giving them access to the Gold Card will go some way to remedying the gross injustice that Mr Patterson and many, many others have been subjected to over the years. That is why I commend this amendment.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I acknowledge the amendment of Senator Wright, which I do not have difficulty with. I think it is a sensible amendment to say there ought to be some costing but that in any event there ought to be a cut-off for when this particular measure is implemented. It cannot be put off to the never-never. This government and the opposition stand condemned for the way they have treated our veterans of British nuclear test. This issue will not go away. Even when the last nuclear test veteran in Australia has died, you will still have to deal with their children, you will still have to deal with their memories and you will still have to deal with the fact that they have been treated very shabbily by successive Australian governments.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I do this because, while the Australian Greens have clearly and consistently over time supported the principle of extending the Gold Card to veterans of British nuclear testing, as a matter of right, it would not be responsible to agree to a measure that at this stage would have open-ended cost implications that have not been budgeted for. Since receiving Senator Xenophon's requested amendment, I have not had the opportunity to determine the costs involved if it were to be implemented. Today I received verbal advice from the minister's representative that the costs could be as great as $100 million. That does seem exorbitant to me, given the relatively small number of veterans involved, but it serves to highlight the need for better information about the costs before legislating for this change.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">That is why I was happy to co-sponsor the second reading amendment that Senator Xenophon has referred to, to have the government examine the cost of expanding eligibility for the Gold Card to nuclear veterans within a certain time period. Unfortunately, that amendment was not agreed to. However, this amendment that I have now moved is an opportunity to determine the costs involved, to have scrutiny and then to determine whether or not it would be possible to implement this longstanding issue of justice for the veterans of the nuclear testing carried out by Britain.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This amendment would mean that Senator Xenophon's amendment could take effect if the measure has been costed and is enshrined in regulation that has not been disallowed by either house. That would ensure that the costings have been carried out, that there is an opportunity for scrutiny by the other place and the Senate and that there is a means of paying for the implementation of the reform. In my view, that is what is required to be fiscally responsible and I urge the Senate to support this amendment and then consider Senator Xenophon's requested amendment in the light of this amendment.</span>

                    </a>  Okay. At the risk of using more courteous language than you used, I will proceed. I note that the government, in the 2010-11 budget, provided a $24 million package of compensation to British nuclear test participants under the Veterans' Entitlements Act 1986. This package ensured that Australian Defence Force participants were provided appropriate compensation and health coverage for any condition related to their service in the testing program. BNT participants are also eligible to receive non-liability health care for all cancers. BNT participants are able to access a Gold Card. It is provided where the veteran is at or above 100 per cent of the general rate of disability pension. The automatic grant of a Gold Card is only provided to veterans with qualifying service—that is, warlike service—over the age of 70, in recognition of the hazards of being in war and incurring danger from the hostile forces of the enemy. The automatic grant of the Gold Card to BNT participants would place them in a more beneficial position than other veterans. For that and other reasons, the government opposes the amendment.</span>

                    </a> (<span class="HPS-State">South Australia</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">20:21</span>):  What an extraordinary response from the government. These veterans are not eligible for a gold card because their service does not qualify as warlike; it was not in a hostile environment. The fact is that they were subject to radiation from nuclear weapons. They were subject without a duty of care being given by the Australian government at the time. They were subject to levels of radiation that have led to many of them developing cancers and dying, levels of radiation that have left many of them with very serious health problems and levels of radiation that have left their children and grandchildren with genetic abnormalities, with deformities, with serious health problems. So to make some artificial distinction that these individuals were not subject to warlike service does not make sense to me. If being subject radiation, to fallout from a nuclear bomb going off, is not warlike in the hazards it exposes our veterans to then what else would be? It just seems extraordinary that this is an exemption. I would urge the backbenchers of the coalition and the government to raise this issue in their party rooms to ensure that this matter is dealt with in a way that gives justice to these veterans.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I acknowledge the long-term advocacy of the Australian Greens, Senator Wright's contribution to this debate and Senator Ludlam's long-time advocacy of this along with Senator Bob Brown. But it seems to me that the issue here is that the government is making excuses as to why it cannot act, and Senator Wright quite rightly expressed surprise at a figure of $100 million. As that is the figure that was given by the minister's office, can the government provide a breakdown of that $100 million? On that calculation, if there are 2,000 individuals who are still alive from the British nuclear tests and all of them put in a claim for medical expenses—I am sure Senator Feeney will correct me if my arithmetic is wrong—you are looking at a figure in the region of $50,000 each. Is that right, Senator Feeney? I am not sure. Tell me. Your arithmetic is probably better than mine.</span>

                    </a> (<span class="HPS-State">South Australia</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">20:24</span>):  That is just not good enough because they have made a representation to Senator Wright. Senator Wright took that representation in good faith but she has questioned it. She received advice from the minister's office that the cost of this amendment would be $100 million. If that is the representation they are giving to the Australian Greens, represented by Senator Wright on this issue, to say why this cannot proceed now, surely there is an obligation on the government, given that they have put it out there, to give us a breakdown of where the $100 million comes from? I think it is a perfectly reasonable question in order to deal with this particular amendment.</span>

If they are going to make an assertion that it is up to $110 million, for goodness sake the government ought to provide the details of that. Where does this figure of up to $110 million come from in order to try to squash this particular amendment or to be dismissive of it? I can tell you those veterans of the British nuclear tests deserve better than some glib figure seemingly plucked out of the air in order to get a fair deal and a fair go with respect to their health care.</span>

                    </a> (<span class="HPS-State">South Australia</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">20:28</span>):  That is not illumination. That is just casting a shroud over things, honestly. As for the notion of $15,600 a year for four years for 2,000 participants, there is no such notion here. Guess what? These people are dying off. In four years time there will not be 2,000 veterans who survived the British nuclear tests here in Australia. Who knows what the number will be, but we know that the rate of death, the rate of these people not being with us on this earth anymore, is increasing. This is simply to say that, in the same way that others who have served in warlike service get a gold card, this is warlike service and this is something they should be entitled to. This issue will not go away. I will pursue it in estimates. I will pursue it with the government. I urge my colleagues in the coalition and the government, particularly my backbench colleagues—including Senators Sterle and Bishop, for whom I have high regard—to take this matter up.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I have just been handed some material that relates to the atomic bombs dropped on Japan. It is interesting to note that radiation is classified into two types: initial radiation, which is released by the atomic bomb within one minute of detonation, and residual radiation, which is released after the initial radiation. Those who were exposed to radiation suffered long after the war was over. It took people a long time to recognise the invisible effects of the A-bomb, of the diseases caused by the A-bomb. A group of symptoms which appeared during the first four or five months after the explosion were called acute sickness or injuries, and symptoms that appeared after a certain incubation period were called after-effects of radiation. That is what we are dealing with. That is why this matter needs to be dealt with with some urgency. I urge my backbench colleagues, of both the government and the opposition, to reconsider their position in relation to the gold card. This will not be the end of it if this amendment is defeated, as it appears that it will be. We need to deal with this. These vague rubbery figures of up to $110 million—the government really stands condemned for the way it has sidelined these concerns.</span>

                    </a> (<span class="HPS-State">Western Australia</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">20:31</span>):  I will add a couple of very quick remarks before we put Senator Wright's and then Senator Xenophon's amendments. I am unsure whether the Parliamentary Secretary for Defence is aware that I do not necessarily support those figures for precisely the reason that Senator Xenophon has put on the record. Do you feel comfortable, Parliamentary Secretary, acknowledging $100 million in unmet need for a particular class of veterans who we appear to be simply sidelining on a technicality? As you said in your statement, from the information you have been given by your advisers, cancer treatment is covered, but you would be well aware that ionising radiation of the kind that was inflicted on these soldiers and the many Aboriginal people who were still on those lands can create a large number of conditions that are not cancer related at all. That is precisely where this huge level of unmet need resides. I strongly support Senator Xenophon for moving this amendment. If you do not trust the figures that you have given us, Senator Wright has given you a perfect opportunity to look at how much it will cost. I cannot believe that we would simply sideline on a technicality this cohort of people who, in the service of our country, were irradiated by British nuclear weapons. I strongly urge a rethink on, if nothing else, Senator Wright's perfectly sensible amendment that says: let us establish how much it will cost. Please, let us not just erase these people from history after what we put them through.</span>

                    </a> (<span class="HPS-State">South Australia</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">20:33</span>):  Further to Senator Ludlam's very useful and pertinent contribution, there is another way of putting this that I think further diminishes the government's argument—and the coalition's argument for that matter. It is the same as a soldier who loses a limb. They are given a gold card because you can see their injury. It is no different for veterans who were injured by the nuclear tests; you just cannot see their injury, it is not so apparent. The effects are dormant, but they are there nonetheless. Given that these people have been exposed to the fallout from a nuclear test, from the British nuclear tests, and that they have this enormous risk of injury because of their exposure, this seems the only just way of doing it. Having said that, I am prepared for the vote. I am prepared for the outcome tonight, but I am not prepared to let this matter rest. Question put:</span>

                    </a> (<span class="HPS-State">Queensland</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">20:47</span>):  As we all know, the business of the 21st century is knowledge. To better compete and to more effectively contribute to Australia's well-being, universities, which are our knowledge factories, have embarked upon change and reform. Over the last few years there has been robust debate about the future of our higher education system—a debate spurred on by the Bradley Review of Australian Higher Education. This debate is likely to last for many years, given the crucial importance of our universities to our economy and indeed to our society in general.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The Higher Education Support Amend­ment (Demand Driven Funding System and Other Measures) Bill is the legislative expression of one of the two main recommendations of the Bradley review, as adopted by the government—namely, the move towards a student demand driven system right across our public universities. The other major recommendation of the Bradley review sets a target for increased participation in higher education of 40 per cent of our young people in the age bracket 25 to 34 by the year 2025, with a particular emphasis on attracting more students from currently underrepresented groups such as students from low SES backgrounds, students from rural and remote areas and of course Australian Indigenous students. These two reforms are interlinked, since abolishing the restrictions on the number of university places will go some way towards increasing participation in higher education.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The coalition supports these reforms, though with some important caveats in regard to both the current bill and the overall implementation of the Bradley reforms by the government—subjects I will touch on later. Let me state at the outset that the move to a system where demand by qualified students determines how many places are offered by universities is a vast improvement on the centralised state control model that has been operating so far, where the public servants in Canberra micromanage the number of places that each university can offer in each particular course. The removal of the restriction on the number of undergraduate places, otherwise known as Commonwealth supported places, that Australian universities are able to offer is a step in the right direction. The laws of supply and demand work better than the dictates of bureaucrats, no matter how well qualified. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">However, the bill does not provide for a complete removal of restrictions. The bill does not uncap the number of enrolments for medical student places as those degrees are reliant on the availability of clinical placements provided by state governments, nor does it uncap the number of Common­wealth supported places for postgraduate students in our universities. The bill also gives the minister for higher education the ability to cap the number of places in particular disciplines or particular institu­tions in defined circumstances. The coalition will await the resolution of these issues and is particularly interested in the last mentioned power, especially in light of the persistent rumours circulating in the university sector that the government might be tempted to start capping places again, having slowly become aware of the fiscal implications of the move to a fully student demand driven system.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The bill goes further than setting up the framework for the partial deregulation of the university sector. It also abolishes the student learning entitlement that requires universities to enter into a mission based compact with the Commonwealth government and to institute policies which promote and protect free intellectual inquiry in learning, teaching and research. The coalition is opposed to abolishing the student learning entitlement. The SLEs were introduced by the Howard government in 2003 and limit a student's ability to qualify for a Commonwealth supported place to a defined number of years of full-time undergraduate study. The defined number of years is typically seven, with some exceptions, and it accrues over the lifetime of the student. The measure was introduced to prevent so-called lifelong or professional students from undertaking continuous studies at taxpayer expense with no intention of ever paying off their FEE-HELP or HECS debt. Far from losing their relevancy over time, the SLEs actually become even more important under the student demand driven system for this reason—abolishing the student learning entitlement, combined with abolishing the restrictions on the number of Commonwealth supported places, results in a system where an unlimited number of students can study for an unlimited amount of time. The government's proposal, under this bill, means that an unlimited number of students can study for an unlimited amount of time. The opposition opposes that. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">What are the fiscal implications of that for taxpayers? No-one knows, including the government, which has not produced any plans, estimates or projections of the cost of implementing the Bradley reforms. In the absence of any concrete information, and considering this government's record of profligacy with other people's money, the coalition believes that it is only sensible to maintain some restrictions, such as the SLEs, on the expansion of higher education costs.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The government argues that the SLE restriction is hindering students who have undertaken a bachelor's degree, followed by a five-year professional degree, from completing their degree by substantially increasing their FEE-HELP debt. The coalition understand that there have indeed been some substantial changes in the way some undergraduate degrees are taught. The coalition are aware of that, so we believe the upper level of student learning entitlement should be set at eight years rather than at the current limit of seven. This would, for example, allow students to undertake a Bachelor of Science degree with an additional honours year and then complete a medical degree. The coalition will be moving an amendment to that effect.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Moving on to compacts, the interim agreements between individual universities and the Commonwealth are already in place and have been for the past few months. These agreements require universities to lay out holistic, integrated plans for linking their research direction with their teaching and learning expertise and to link these goals to a university's Commonwealth Grant Scheme funding agreement. While not ignoring the potential benefits of compacts, the coalition still retain some concerns about these new arrangements. We are worried that compacts could be used to micromanage universities rather than to simply align the universities' objectives with those of the Commonwealth. At a time when the university system is undergoing significant reform and expansion, the coalition would not want to see the freedom to diversify and excel restricted by the Canberra education bureaucrats. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Our universities are now competing not just against each other within Australia but against all other universities in the world. At stake are the significant income and other benefits derived from international students, the capacity to attract the best staff and the ability to build and enhance reputation. All this calls for less, not more, regulation and for more, not less, flexibility. To that effect, I will be moving a second reading amendment that reminds the government of the growth of red tape under their administration and of their broken promise to only introduce new regulation after repealing an earlier one. Universities already suffer under the compliance burden of myriad different regulations and requirements imposed on them, mostly by federal laws and regulations. Legions of employees are now needed to ensure policies are adhered to or that information is collected for the federal government. Imposing more regulation, as may be the case under the compacts, goes completely against the spirit of higher education reform, where the trend is towards more freedom, more flexibility, more choice and more options. The amendment I will move as a second reading amendment broadly seeks to minimise the regulatory burden on universities.</span>

                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The bill also requires universities to have institutional policies in place to promote and protect free intellectual inquiry in learning, teaching and research. The bill does not prescribe what is to be included in these policies. While the coalition firmly believe in the value of academic freedom, we also believe that the prescription in this bill is only half complete. With that in mind, we will be moving an amendment to ensure that academic freedom extends not just to academics but also to students, researchers and other teachers. Students in particular have complained to me and to many others for many years about their work being marked not on the quality of their argument, their understanding of the material and the clarity of their thoughts but on the basis of their political philosophy, which often conflicts with that of their lecturers. Of course when I marked assignments, I would never have marked any assignment with less than great objectivity. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Requiring universities to have a policy on academic freedom for students as well as teachers will assist students in exploring their own philosophical underpinnings without fear that their views will offend the sensitive and sometimes indignant sensibilities of some academics. We could not have that, could we? The coalition stands for free inquiry for academics as well as free inquiry for students, without fear and without favour. This is, after all, what education, as opposed to indoctrination, is supposed to be all about. In the autumn sittings this parliament passed legislation to establish the Tertiary Education Quality and Standards Agency, adopting another recommendation of the Bradley review. I took some time then, and will take some time now, to reiterate some serious concerns the coalition has with the government's approach to implementing these far-reaching reforms. It is even more important to restate these concerns during the debate about the bill that seeks to implement one of the two major pillars of the Bradley reforms.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Let's face it, implementation—as you have heard me say many times in this chamber—has always been the Achilles heel of the Rudd and Gillard governments. Not many other portfolios have the dubious distinction of being able to illustrate this point better than my own area of education. Here one can name one program after another—Building the Education Revolution, computers in schools, fibre connection to schools, trade training centres, Indigenous children and family centres, Indigenous residential colleges—which read like an encyclopaedia of government failure. What all these programs, as well as numerous other examples such as the NBN, pink batts, or digital set top boxes for pensioners, have in common is this: there does not seem to have been much planning done after the initial brainwave from the minister or the Prime Minister's office. There are no cost-benefit analyses done, no proper studies, estimates and projections prepared, and no mechanisms put in place to properly supervise the implementation and oversee the expenditure of taxpayers' moneys. I raise these concerns once again because I am increasingly worried that this government's cavalier 'by the seat of their pants' approach to implementing its broad education agenda will infect the grand project of reforming Australia's higher education system.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The Bradley review set an ambitious goal of increasing participation in tertiary education to 40 per cent of our young people by the year 2025. The government has adopted this goal. It is perfectly obvious to everyone in the sector as well as any observer that a significant influx of additional student numbers over the next two decades or so will necessitate a large expansion of universities' physical and teaching infrastructure—that is certain. This in turn will require additional government outlays of tens of billions of dollars between now and 2025.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">How much exactly? That is a very good question; sadly, it is not one that the government has answered. It did not even ask it in the first place. And so we do not know the true cost or indeed the benefits of the Bradley reforms. We also do not know what impact these reforms will have on our universities. All we can say is that considering the lack of planning and the government's ham-fisted approach to implementing its programs, we have reason—the opposition has reason, Australia has reason—to be concerned.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Let me say this: the coalition will not tolerate a blind and uninformed rush towards increased participation if it would in any way damage our higher education system and affect its performance and international reputation. We cannot allow a situation to develop where quantity is achieved at the expense of quality. We will not stand by and allow university degrees to be devalued, because the government wants to encourage more young people to participate in tertiary education without providing adequate financing for universities to cope with the expansion—all resulting in falling standards. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We will be watching very carefully how these reforms unfold. The coalition's broad support for these goals does not mean a blank cheque as to the means. We will try to do our best to hold the government to account and ensure that these crucial reforms are carried out in a responsible manner.</span>

                      <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Senator RHIANNON</span>
                    </a> (<span class="HPS-State">New South Wales</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">21:04</span>):  I speak to the <span style="&#xD;&#xA;    font-size:10pt;&#xD;&#xA;  ">Higher Education Support Amendment (Demand Driven Funding System and Other Measures) Bill 2011 </span>today as the Australian Greens spokesperson on higher education. It is recognised that the quality and reach of a country's higher education shapes its future. It builds a nation's social well-being and provides the next generation with the skills and knowledge which are vital to our economic development and our place within the competitive global economy. Yet in Australia, higher education has been approached not as an investment in future capacity but as a cost largely borne by the student and the sector itself. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The gap between increasing student numbers and diminishing public funding continues to grow. In 2009 there were over 1.1 million students enrolled in Australian universities, nearly 80 per cent more than just 13 years ago. Yet during this time public investment in higher education has gone backwards. The real value of operating grants has not increased since 1994 with the value per student place actually plunging in real terms by 30 per cent over that period. Public investment in our universities sat at a shameful 0.7 per cent of our GDP in 2007, well below the one per cent OECD average and just five places up from the bottom of the list of 35 rated OECD countries and partner countries. As a result, universities have turned to cutting spending and raising income. Diverting money to profit, making projects and chasing the corporate dollar has resulted in a growing dependence on overseas full fee paying students who prop up the sector and provide nearly 60 per cent of Australia's $16.5 billion of export income from education—the nation's third largest source of export income after coal and iron ore in 2008-09. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Meanwhile, student to staff ratios have blown out. Casualisation of the workforce has compromised quality for students and teachers. Academics must do more with less and university infrastructure has not kept up. Students on inadequate income support have struggled to juggle the demands of study and employment needed to survive. This is the state of our higher education, all while Australia has surfed the crest of a decades long mining boom. It is with many reservations that the Greens approach this bill—a market based, demand driven approach to improving access to quality higher education in Australia. This bill aims to implement the government's target of nearly doubling to 40 per cent the number of university educated people by 2025, with 20 per cent of undergraduates coming from disadvantaged backgrounds. It is an excellent goal but there are concerns that this approach could push our universities and the quality of our higher education over the edge. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">There are two overarching concerns that the Greens have with this bill: that demand driven funding will become the first step towards a voucher system in Australia, and how the need for significant further investment in universities to support the sudden increase in student numbers will be met. The Greens' concerns are demonstrated in New Zealand's disastrous attempt to introduce pure demand driven tertiary education in the late 1980s. That demand driven model extended to the whole tertiary sector, including the polytechnics and over 220 private providers. The New Zealand government had no ability to steer or shape the courses being offered and quality control was absent. Not surprisingly, the whole thing blew out of control. A huge growth in student numbers brought unsustainable costs and rising student failure and attrition. The bulk of growth was at subdegree and diploma levels delivered by private institutions, and any public return on the qualifications gained were questionable. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">An example of how badly wrong it went, as current New Zealand Deputy Prime Minister Bill English said when he was shadow minister for education, is demonstrated by the beginner computer course run by a large polytechnic in partnership with a software producer. Students were enrolled in shopping centres, libraries and through school fundraising committees who were paid a fee per enrolment gained. Students thus enrolled were actually handed a CD of four courses which equated to four enrolments with public demand driven funding attached. More than 20,000 people enrolled in this CD based course, costing a cool $15 million in public funding. The provider generated about a 90 per cent gross margin per enrolled student, with a grand total of three per cent of those students known to have finished the course. Not surprisingly, New Zealand learnt a lesson from that experiment and has been reining in its system for many years now. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Whilst I do believe that the government in drafting this bill has learnt from the New Zealand lesson, it does demonstrate the risks involved in travelling down this path and it provides a cautionary tale about quality, accountability and a firm governmental hand on the steering wheel to ensure qualifications are about real learning. And whilst I acknowledge that this bill is only a partial deregulation and does not in the strictest sense create a voucher system, I share the strong concerns raised by student groups and unions that the bill is moving the sector in that direction and that the dramatic increase in student numbers that this bill allows for will place further strain on resources such as classrooms, facilities, services and student amenities. I will address these concerns but first start with the aspects of this bill that the Greens support without contention. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The abolition of the student learning entitlement from next year makes sense. Few students exceed the SLE's seven-year limit to funded undergraduate study. Universities will save the extra cost of administering the scheme and the limit to updating qualifications will be removed. The strengthening of academic's and students' intellectual freedom by making that right an object of the act is vital. The requiring of providers to have policies that uphold the right to intellectual freedom as a condition of funding provides a necessary accountability mechanism. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I will now turn to the centrepiece of this bill: demand driven funding of higher education. From next year, the uncapping of public funded places for domestic undergraduates will ensure anyone with the ability is guaranteed a funded university place. Funding will be detached from each university course and will follow the student, allowing them to enrol in the course and university of their choice. Increased access for all is a positive thing and students are responding, with the 2009 estimate revised upwards to an extra 59,000 places by 2013 and an extra $1.2 billion in funding to cover it. However, the huge risk is that rapid, unfettered growth will lack the investment required to support the extra teachers and learning resources in a system already struggling with historic underfunding per student. This bill does not adequately address the chronic funding gap between the cost of delivering a course and the funding received to deliver it. Nor does it protect against the risk of further casualisation in higher education or the risk of fees becoming fully deregulated in the future. There is a real concern that any deregulation of higher education could eventually lead to a two-tier system in both funding and quality of teaching. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">It is worth noting some of the problems with a full voucher system. As student demand changes from year to year, it is hard for universities to plan for a permanent workforce and for building resources. Research has shown that the middle to higher end of SES groups benefit from a voucher system rather than it helping the most disadvantaged students. Despite the rhetoric, a voucher system does not mean that students can study where they like, as institutions will still set course numbers. It can lead to poaching of students by larger universities and widen the divide between prestigious institutions and smaller or regionally based ones. It removes the government from its responsibility to create an accountable higher education system. A voucher system can separate teaching funding and research funding, which can reduce overall levels of research funding.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Given these risks and concerns, it would have been better timing to wait for a government response to the yet to be reported base funding review before debating this bill. That really would have been the responsible course of action for this government. The base funding of student places and a need for indexed basic grant amounts is a pivotal factor on which the quality and health of the sector does turn.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The whims of the marketplace and consumer demand are not a steady framework on which to build a sustainable future. The flow of students and thus funding to various universities can actually fall two ways. It could encourage specialisation in our universities as they develop excellence to attract and keep the student and their funding, and may drive innovation and constructive partnerships with industry to address skill shortages and meet the needs of a new low-carbon economy. Or it could compromise quality, providing homogenised courses across the board to cater to mass student trends, diverging from the needs of a healthy economy and society's wellbeing.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This could be exacerbated by a concentration of high-demand, low-cost courses such as law and commerce at the expense of high-cost courses needed in a modern economy, such as engineering and science. It may provide the opportunity for smaller and regional universities to play to their strengths—strengthening provision for their natural catchment of disadvantaged or isolated students, with the extra funding loads that go with those students subsidising other offerings. Already regional universities are planning to invigorate and enrich regional on-campus life as a selling point and are improving the quality of their distance education offerings for their isolated students. Alternatively, it could allow the bigger, better resourced universities to poach those students along with their chunk of extra equity funding, furthering the divide between the elite and the smaller universities—although this carries its own risk of an inability to fund extra infrastructure needs and staffing levels in high-demand courses.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">How will universities plan for growth and ensure quality? Where is the government's plan to address skill shortages in this country—skills needed to participate as part of a globalised community? We need a much clearer picture from the government of the steps it plans to take to minimise these serious risks. For example, whilst the current proposal does not impose any set time or value on the student's learning entitlement, or voucher, it is possible that such limitations could be placed on a student's entitlement in the future. It is also possible that fees may be deregulated in the future, leaving a gap between the student's funding entitlement and the cost of the course. It is not clear how these potential risks are being addressed. The whole point of the bill is that it will remove the ability for universities to charge full fees and it will remove the learning entitlement. That a future government can change this is a moot point with any legislation.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Another issue is that the bill will allow the government to set a cap—a limit on maximum basic grant funding—for courses to rein in excessive course growth, designating them by disallowable legislative instrument. Any demand driven or non-designated course can be thus designated. For example, medicine is a designated course to avoid oversupply of graduates for too few placements. Previously, a government could cut funding by reducing places. The bill will ensure the imposition of a cap on maximum basic grant amounts must not be less than the amount for the previous year. Whilst such a change would be subject to parliamentary scrutiny, clear criteria is needed around triggers for changing demand driven courses to designated courses to either boost or limit demand. How will the government convince a university they must provide high-cost, low-student-demand courses such as engineering or science even when they are listed as national priority courses? We do need to hear an answer to that question. How will designating low-demand courses such as the classics and the arts ensure that universities will deliver them? These are important areas of scholarship and cultural learning that we cannot afford to lose through attrition of demand. Yet these courses will not be funded unless the places are actually filled by students.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This bill's mission based compacts are key to the government's ability to steer the demand driven model around these risks and to temper the vagaries of the marketplace. These three-year contracts between publicly funded universities and the government include funding details and negotiated performance, equity and quality targets. They are supposed to align each university's activities with their missions and with the government's goals for higher education and to ensure that quality and participation standards are met with performance funding attached to achieving those targets.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Given the imperative to ensure quality of provision in our higher education, it must be ensured that the performance indicators use objective and proven quality indicators and that the methods of collecting data are protected from manipulation by universities. The intention of compacts to negotiate performance targets based on an individual university's missions and goals must be upheld so that universities are held to their own real improvements and not to predetermined targets across the board that may not match their mission or that they already exceed. The success of the compacts is fraught and dependent on the government's and each university's diligence and good faith. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">In the meantime, the higher education sector is facing a great unknown. Its major private income stream, international students, is dropping. It is facing a huge increase in student enrolments to a historically underfunded system without yet knowing if base funding will be increased to catch up to and meet actual costs of delivering this brave new world.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This bill is part of a 10-year package to repair and invigorate higher education in Australia. The extra funding and better student support is a good start, despite our reservations and concerns about any move towards a voucher system. We cannot afford to ignore the risks, and the Greens are committed to closely watching the effects of this legislation and whether it achieves its aim of rewarding any student entering into higher education with appropriate support and a quality experience. We call on the government to heed the concerns of student organisations about paving the way for a voucher system in higher education and the call from the sector for sustainable base funding levels. The challenges are many.</span>

                      <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Senator CAROL BROWN</span>
                    </a> (<span class="HPS-State">Tasmania</span>—<span class="HPS-MinisterialTitles">Deputy Government Whip in the Senate</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">21:23</span>):  I rise to contribute to the debate tonight on the Higher Education Support Amendment (Demand Driven Funding System and Other Measures) Bill 2011. For too long Australia has lagged behind the rest of the OECD when it comes to the proportion of our population who have a tertiary qualification. We invest so much in trying to inspire our children on a lifelong journey of learning and yet, for some, there are still limited educational opportunities beyond formal schooling. Despite huge growth in the numbers of women attending university, the fact remains that there are still groups of Australians who are underrepresented in tertiary education, including Indigenous Australians, those from low socioeconomic backgrounds and those from rural and regional areas.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">In my home state we have a fantastic university, the University of Tasmania. We also have one of the lowest participation rates in higher education in Australia. Whilst I do not believe that this restructure will be the panacea to that participation problem, I hope that our progressive reforms to the tertiary system will make higher education more accessible. There is overwhelming support and evidence to suggest that the legislation that is before us today is the best way forward for higher education across Australia.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This legislation is about revolutionising the way in which the tertiary sector in Australia is funded. Moving toward a demand driven model rather than forcing each institution to come back year in, year out and negotiate capped places will only work to promote and enhance the accessibility of higher education to Australians regardless of their background. Moving toward a demand driven funding model is also the most appropriate way to ensure that we are equipped for the future challenges in a rapidly changing global economy.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This bill ensures that as a government we meet our commitment to introducing an uncapped student demand system for universities for 2012. Through these funding reforms we will provide our institutions with a flexibility within the sector to meet our national target of having at least 40 per cent of 25- to 34-year-olds with a bachelor level degree or above by 2025. As we work towards achieving our participation target, we will boost our rankings within the OECD and serve to bolster our credibility as a thinking and innovative nation in our region and beyond.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This bill is also significant insofar as it adds the finishing touches to the Labor government's reform agenda for the higher education sector. We have progressively delivered on the commitment that we made in 2009 so that from 2012 our universities will benefit from the deregulation of the allocation of university places through the introduction of a demand driven system for domestic students, except for medicine, and the abolition of student learning entitlement, the SLE, for all courses and the introduction of mission-based compacts and the strengthening of academic freedom.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Fundamentally, this legislation ensures that Australian students can access tertiary education based on their ability, on academic merit and on a willingness to participate rather than just their capacity to pay for it. As well as transforming funding for the tertiary sector, this legislation also abolishes the student learning entitlement. The student learning entitlement is a hangover of the Howard years which limited a student's access to a Commonwealth loan, HECS-HELP, after seven years of study. The introduction of the student learning entitlement created equity issues and posed a threat to lifelong learning. It was proven to have discriminated against low SES and mature-age students and those who chose to change their study pathway. Moreover, the SLE created an administrative burden on universities and, whilst the student learning entitlement was allegedly introduced to promote retention, it did not translate in any way to provide funding for support for students at each institution.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">It follows that the abolition of the student learning entitlement will remove a regulatory burden that has been placed on universities since 2003 and ensure that there is no time or dollar limit on a student's learning achieve­ment. It will also remove a significant barrier that medical students have faced since 2003 and has been welcomed by the AMA. No longer will medical students, particularly those who have articulated into medicine from science streams, be disadvantaged when they choose to study medicine because of a fear of exhausting their entitlement.</span>

                    </a>  Notwithstanding the good senator opposite. We are seeing in this place those opposite playing up again. It is not unlike Senator Mason to play up a bit, but they are also relying on outdated and factually baseless arguments about how this reform will let students waste time lingering in our universities and draining taxpayers dollars. In Australia we simply do not have a situation where students are studying for excessively long periods of time. It is a myth. Those opposite seem to be stuck in a bit of a time warp and lack a true understanding of what tertiary education means today and to the unique intellectual capital of our nation. Those opposite were never serious about investing in higher education in any meaningful way. They simply dressed up the student learning entitlement, painting it as a policy aimed at improving retention while continuing to rip funding out of the tertiary sector. The student learning entitlement never transpired into funding for essential services and student support—those proven elements of any retention strategy. Across the sector, the Group of Eight and others have come out in full favour of the abolition of student learning entitlement. Put frankly, Senator Mason, it is time to move on.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This legislation also provides for the introduction of mission based compacts between the government via the Department of Education, Employment and Workplace Relations and tertiary institutions. The mission based compact will be the mechanism through which universities can show how they are contributing to the government's goals for higher education. The compacts will include details of the major education and research funding for each institution as well as performance targets. The compacts will allow for universities to be rewarded for improving the quality of their offerings, attainment and the participation of students in higher education. As the mission based compacts will differentiate between teaching and research, they will allow an accurate benchmark from which to measure and reward performance, taking the sector forward.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I will now take a moment to talk about the academic freedom aspects of this bill. Notwithstanding Senator Mason's no-doubt-excellent record on objectivity and impartiality when he was lecturing, this bill will also bolster academic freedom, enshrining the government's commitment to free intellectual inquiry in legislation. Until the introduction of this bill, academic freedom was assured only through the national protocols agreed to at the Ministerial Council on Education, Employment, Training and Youth Affairs in 2007.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This bill extends the government's commitment to academic freedom by ensuring that it relates to learning, teaching and research. Including an explicit reference to learning also bolsters a student's access to intellectual freedom. Of course, those opposite will criticise this element of the legislation too. It comes as no surprise that they would again play up on their old rhetoric. Manifest in their long-held paranoia is their mistaken belief that free intellectual inquiry and the protection of academic freedom are biased towards the Left. I only hope that they can for once put aside this baseless assumption and help the government bolster academic freedom for learning, teaching and research within Australia's tertiary sector.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This legislation represents the final pillar in our higher education platform. It builds on the results of the major programs of reform that the Prime Minister commenced as Minister for Education in 2009. As a direct result of our reform agenda already, we have seen close to 100,000 additional students grasp the opportunity of a university education since 2007. Since then we have seen an extra 80,000 undergraduate students each year get the opportunity of a university education, from 408,000 in 2007 to 488,000 this year. We have also seen the number of Commonwealth supported postgraduate places double from 16½ thousand in 2007 to 33,000 this year. Having already succeeded in opening the doors of Australia's universities to more students than ever before, we are even more determined to continue to boost participation.</span>

National Union of Students President Jesse Marshall in May this year branded the legislation a 'welcome investment in providing opportunity to Australians to participate in higher education'. Universities Australia has expressed strong support for this bill, urging all parties to support the legislation and approach it in the spirit of bipartisanship.

                  <span class="HPS-Small">Along with a national regulator and the potential for positive outcomes from the Review of Higher Education Base Funding, provision of funding on the basis of student demand further defines the Government's new foundations for the university sector.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Innovative Research Universities also welcomed the changes, arguing that the bill achieves its intended purpose of allowing universities to be funded for each enrolled undergraduate except, as I have said before, medicine.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I want to echo and endorse some of the comments of the Minister for Tertiary Education, Skills, Jobs and Workplace Relations, Senator Chris Evans. Minister Evans described this new legislation as the opportunity for Australia to move away from a decades-old system of central planning for university funding in which, every year, universities negotiated student places with Canberra. He said:</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">For the first time, universities will be able to grow with confidence and diversify in response to student needs.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Small">Our commitment as a government is to the continued expansion of a high quality university sector, to educate the graduates needed by an economy based on knowledge, skills and innovation.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">As the Bradley review highlighted, the quality and performance of a nation's higher education system will be clear determinants of its economic and social progress.</span>

                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">OECD data shows that Australia's proportion of graduates in the population is less than in comparable developed economies. This was echoed within the Bradley review. The review warned that Australia was falling behind other countries in both performance and investment in higher education. Moreover, the review reaffirmed that we will need more well qualified people in Australia to meet the demands of a rapidly growing global economy. The only way to increase participation in higher education is to look to those groups that are underrepresented in our universities. These are Indigenous Australians, people with low socioeconomic status and people from regional and remote areas.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We also must strategically invest in our education sector. Let us not forget that educational institutions, particularly our universities, form the third-largest export industry in Australia. Developing the intellectual capital of our nation is vital both for our own national development and prosperity and also to secure our reputation and rankings worldwide.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The reforms we have progressively introduced since 2009 ensure that we are laying the strongest foundations for our future at home, in our region and beyond. I look forward to seeing more Australians, regardless of their background, aspiring to and achieving a higher education.</span>

                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">To recap what this legislation plans to do. The Australian government is fully committed to transforming Australia's higher education system through implementing a demand driven system for funding undergraduate places at higher education providers, which are listed in the table in the Higher Education Support Act. The bill will give effect to the implementation of the demand driven funding system for undergraduate student places at public universities from 2012. It will do so by removing the current cap on funding for undergraduate Commonwealth supported places, except for medicine, and the current seven-year limit placed on students' eligibility to receive Commonwealth support for their higher education.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">In the new demand driven funding system universities will have greater flexibility to respond to student and market demands. The amendments are integral to achieving the government's higher education attainment target of increasing the proportion of 25- to 34-year-old Australians with bachelor-level qualifications to 40 per cent by 2025. The mission based compacts will provide for Commonwealth oversight of the teaching and research missions. The bill will also promote free intellectual inquiry.</span>

                    </a> (<span class="HPS-State">New South Wales</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">21:39</span>):  I am pleased to support the Higher Education Support Amendment (Demand Driven Funding System and Other Measures) Bill 2011. The bill is the final piece of legislation in the government's implementation plan for higher education reforms, which was announced in 2009. It meets the commitment to introduce an uncapped student demand driven system in 2012 in order to increase the participation of students in courses and the rates of tertiary educational attainment in our population.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">It is commonsense that when a person is eligible for university they should have a good chance of being able to gain access to a university place. However, this common­sense approach struggled to prevail under the Howard government, which saw too many talented Australians being turned away from universities because there were not enough funded places. This government, I am proud to say, will end such inequality and see doors opened to more students than ever before.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The government's higher education reforms provide extra funding for the sector, extra support for students and extra opportunities to universities to offer more places to those willing to gain a tertiary education. The main purpose of the bill is to implement a new system for the funding of undergraduate places at universities eligible for funding of Commonwealth supported places under the Higher Education Support Act. The amendments in this bill will seek to remove the caps imposed on the number of student places at each university. Instead it will provide places according to demand.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The bill has come about as a result of a wide-ranging review of the Australian higher education system that was chaired by Professor Denise Bradley. The government accepted a number of the recommendations of the Bradley review, including deregulating the allocation of university places through a demand driven entitlement system for domestic students; changes to the indexation formula of university funding; increasing targeted places to improve participation rates of low socioeconomic status students; and establishing a new tertiary education quality and standards agency.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">These changes will begin the process of working towards two key targets that were established by the Bradley review. Firstly, a national target of at least 40 per cent of 25- to 34-year-olds having attained a qualification at a bachelor level or above by 2025. Secondly, that by 2020 twenty per cent of university enrolments at undergraduate level are people from low socioeconomic status backgrounds.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The cornerstone of a strong economy is an educated workforce. To provide for economic output that meets our country's achievements, we need to provide the best trained workforce in Australia and work towards being one of the most educated economies in the western world. Skills Australia has forecast that by 2025 one-third of all jobs will require a minimum of a bachelor's degree qualification. To meet that demand for highly skilled workers, this government is ensuring that everyone who is eligible can gain access to a place at an Australian university. More Australians with TAFE or university qualifications means more Australians in good jobs and higher living standards for everyone. To start this process we will invest almost $490 million over the next four years, from 2012, to uncap the number of public university places, allowing universities to offer enrolments to all eligible students. This will create an additional 80,000 student places over the four years from 2010 to 2013, allowing about 50,000 additional students to participate in higher education. We are delivering on our promise of a new era for universities, delivering on our promise of an education revolution which focuses on students, on more access to university education, on research and innovation, on improving the skills of the workforce and on boosting productivity.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We are also building on the government's relationship of trust and mutual respect for universities. The bill also seeks to abolish the student learning entitlement. This entitlement was the subject of criticism from universities and from students. The bill also introduces requirements for universities to have policies in place to protect academic freedom in learning, teaching and research. The bill will require universities to enter into mission based compacts with the government. These mission based compacts are three-year agreements that show how each university's mission contributes to the government's goals for higher education and they include details of major higher education and research funding and performance targets. The compacts will be in two parts—one for teaching and one for research—and they will define targets for improvement and for reform. The targets will relate to quality, attainment and participation by students from underrepresented groups.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Key stakeholders in the tertiary sector—the universities and students—agree it is sensible to remove the regulatory burden and reduce administrative costs for universities so they can meet the requirements of accepting additional students. This bill will allow that to occur. We are allowing universities to pursue their main mission, which is excellence in teaching, in research and in innovation—quite simply, doing what they do best. These changes to legislation will achieve positive outcomes, increasing commencements and achieving greater equality by ensuring university places are open to talent, not just to family, school or social background.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The reforms will raise the aspirations of students who would previously never have considered going to university. This will also lift the number of low-socioeconomic-status enrolments in universities. Many of these students will be the very first members of their family to have the opportunity to attend university, and for these students access to a world-class education will give them the skills they need to achieve a better standard of living and higher paying, quality jobs for tomorrow. This is a fine Labor policy and vision, an investment in long-term reform giving more Australians the skills and education they need for a good job and a secure future.

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">These reforms have seen us move away from a decades-old system of central planning to a new, demand driven approach. The Gillard government's reforms of higher education underpin our drive to build a highly educated, skilled and productive workforce to underpin our nation's future. This is the final bill in a suite of reforms, the final piece of legislation in the government's implementation of the higher education reforms announced in 2009. It meets our commitment to introduce an uncapped, student demand driven system in 2012 in order to increase participation and it meets the national target set by the review of 40 per cent of 20- to 34-year-olds having attained a qualification of bachelor level or above by 2025. I commend the bill to the Senate.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-State">New South Wales</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">21:50</span>):  Tonight I wish to speak on an issue that is posing a threat to our country's surf lifesaving clubs—in particular, the 128 surf lifesaving clubs that are located within my home state of New South Wales. The issue relates to rising sea levels and the threat that they pose to the life and the wellbeing of our surf clubs. Many members of this nation's surf clubs enjoy worthwhile lifestyles, and I am pleased to say that I have been a member of a surf lifesaving club in Sydney for 26 years. As a long-time member and former president of Maroubra Surf Life Saving Club, I have many wonderful memories of my time on the beach, watching over fellow beachgoers in often wild and at times unforgiving surf conditions.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">From an early age I was taught to treat the ocean with the utmost respect. Indeed, its power and propensity to turn from beautiful to ugly at a moment's notice means it deserves nothing less. This was a lesson drilled into me as a youngster: even when your back is turned, you always keep one eye on the ocean. Mother Nature can be a supremely unpredictable force. This is a lesson that has served me and many surf lifesavers well throughout the world.</span>

                  </a>  That is true. I feel that it is my duty today to pass on that lesson about always keeping your eye on the beach, because some coastal regions of New South Wales are finding out the ability of the ocean to sneak up on them. Surf clubs of this nation make up the first line of defence against the vastness of the ocean and they are, at present, facing a serious threat in the form of extreme weather events associated with sea level rise. The surf clubs are often the first to experience the effects of rising sea levels in this country and as such do not have the luxury to 'um and ah' over this threat. They need to take action in order to save themselves and to save the Australian way of life.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">In recognising the challenges that climate change, changing weather events and sea level rise are posing for our nation, Surf Life Saving Australia has commissioned a study to develop a climate change adaptation road map that will assist in the management of projected climate change impacts. The objective of this study was to understand the risks posed by climate change, to review available strategies to address those risks and to develop a program to implement the identified strategies. The outcome is a climate change adaptation road map for surf lifesaving which outlines strategies that will increase the resilience of surf lifesaving to the projected impacts of climate change. These outcomes represent an important first step for surf lifesaving in preparing for the impacts of climate change.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Climate change is indeed a pressing issue and one that is already having an impact on a number of surf clubs. Without action, it will continue to threaten and impact on one of this nation's most iconic movements. The study is entitled <span style="font-style:italic;">Impact of extreme weather events and climate change on surf </span><span style="font-style:italic;">life saving</span><span style="font-style:italic;"> services</span>. It assessed the range of risks climate change might pose to the surf lifesaving movement and identified a range of strategies to deal with them. Increased sea levels, altered wave climates, modified rainfall patterns and changes to the frequency and intensity of storms are just some of the effects of climate change the study found the movement will need to face in the coming years. It is true that these effects are expected with or without climate change, but the damage caused by climate change will be far greater if no action is taken to mitigate the impact.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Of the 128 surf clubs in New South Wales, 47 per cent are located in coastal zones classified as zones of potential instability. Cudgen Headland is a surf lifesaving club on Kingscliff Beach in the north of New South Wales and perhaps one of the most vulnerable. This surf club has been hit hard recently by storm events which have caused shoreline recession in front of the club and along the adjoining beach, resulting in decreased amenity for beach users and impact on the surf club and interclub surf carnivals. The New South Wales Surf Life Saving Championships were held at the beach in March of this year and just prior to that event the local council, the surfing community and the surf club were required to dump sand from the adjoining river onto the beach just so there was enough sand to run the events. The club has been working with the Tweed Shire council to establish temporary protection measures, including sea wall construction and sand nourishment. These actions combined with the natural sediment renourishment from Cudgen Creek have improved the condition of the beach adjacent to the club. Cases such as at Cudgen Headland highlight the impact of natural climate variability on coastal conditions. Projections for climate change, including a rise in mean sea level, are likely to continue to exacerbate existing management issues and generate new management challenges for surf clubs everywhere.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Sea level rise as a result of climate change will have a number of different physical and ecological effects on coastal systems, including direct inundation, flood and storm damage, loss of wetlands, erosion, saltwater intrusion of coastal aquifers and associated rising water tables. These are all risks which were identified in the surf lifesaving study. Other effects of climate change, such as higher sea water temperatures, changes in precipitation patterns and changes in storm tracks, frequency and intensity will also affect coastal systems, both directly and through interactions with sea level rise. The report found:</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Small">Almost all Surf Lifesaving Clubs (SLSCs) in Australia are located at the forefront of the coastal zone, often within metres of the shoreline. Understandably, the vast majority of SLSCs are located on sandy beaches, which provide high amenity and support recreational use. Sandy coastal zones are vulnerable to coastal erosion and thus sensitive to the impacts of climate change. Over 63 per cent of SLSCs nationally are situated on coastal areas classified as zones of potential instability. Projected impacts of climate change include coastal erosion leading to asset exposure and changes in coastal beach safety through altered beach form.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">These biogeophysical effects will, in turn, have direct and indirect socioeconomic impacts on tourism, human settlements, agriculture, freshwater supply and quality, fisheries, financial services and human health in the coastal zone.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">For the great surf lifesaving movement of this nation, the impact of climate change and rising sea levels is already being felt and will continue to be an issue that the movement will need to grapple with for many years to come. It is heartening to see the foresight of those involved in the administration of surf lifesaving through the development of this road map for dealing with climate change. I would like to place on record my congratulations to the administrators of surf lifesaving in this country for their commitment to dealing with the issue of climate change, for their commitment to working with the government to address what is a serious economic and social issue for our nation and for their commitment to ensuring the continued viability of a great pastime, a great Australian tradition and a great volunteer movement and organisation in our country. I remain committed to working with the movement to deal with one of the most pressing economic and social issues of our generation.</span>

I note that Monsignor Cappo has just retired from his position as Social Inclusion Commissioner for the South Australian government. Specifically, tonight I am calling for the federal government to make a serious, detailed and formal inquiry into allegations made by Archbishop John Hepworth, the primate of the Traditional Anglican Communion, and how they may reflect on this planned appointment to the federal government task force.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">As has been detailed recently in the <span style="font-style:italic;">Australian</span>, Archbishop Hepworth was the victim of violent rapes perpetrated by three priests when he was a young boy studying to become a priest and during his early years of priesthood. I have spoken to John exten­sively about this today and will detail the crimes perpetrated against him shortly, because I believe you need to understand the severity of abuse to fully comprehend the inadequacy of the response of the Catholic Church in South Australia. I believe the weakness of that response can be traced in part to Monsignor Cappo, who, for reasons not fully explained, has failed to act in a timely and decisive manner on this important issue.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">I raise the need for immediate action in the context of the fact that one of the men who raped Archbishop Hepworth is still working as a senior Catholic priest, running a parish in South Australia. This priest, who John says violently and repeatedly raped him, maintains a privileged position in the Catholic Church. When contacted by the <span style="font-style:italic;">Australian</span> about the allegations last week, the priest said:</span>

              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Small">Good try but I won't say anything.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The raping of another human being is no laughing matter. The fact that a serving Catholic priest could meet inquiries about sexual assault with giggles is deeply disturbing. The fact that the inquiries related to this priest's own behaviour makes the reaction even more incongruous—even more bizarre.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Archbishop Hepworth says he reported the abuse he suffered to Monsignor David Cappo and Archbishop Philip Wilson way back in 2007. Archbishop Hepworth told these men he was repeatedly raped at various times over a 12-year period, beginning when he was 15. The assaults involved two priests and a fellow seminary student who was later ordained. Two of the rapists, Ronald Pickering and John Stockdale, who raped John while he was under 18, are deceased. The third priest, who raped John from on or around the time he turned 18, is still alive. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Despite being told of the abuse in 2007 and receiving a detailed six-page statement in March 2008, David Cappo told John Hepworth this year that the investigation was still at 'a preliminary stage' because, he claimed, incredibly, John had not lodged a formal complaint. I find this response to be as troubling as it is inadequate. It does not compare well with the response of the Catholic Church in Melbourne which, through the Melbourne inquiry process, has taken the crimes committed by Ronald Pickering against John Hepworth incredibly seriously. The Independent Commissioner, Peter O'Callaghan QC, took just 12 months to resolve the matter and allowed Archbishop Hepworth to speak openly about the abuse and the resolution process. Mr O'Callaghan also accepted in his report that John had suffered 'many other instances of sexual abuse by members of the clergy in South Australia'. The Catholic Church in Victoria has provided an apology and some financial compensation. It should be noted that Cardinal George Pell, the Archbishop of Sydney, was instrumental in directing John Hepworth to the Melbourne process. Cardinal Pell deserves credit for that.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I would also like to raise my concerns about the potential abuse of the seal of the confessional in light of this case. We know in John Hepworth's case that one of his attackers tried to use the seal of the confessional to silence him by confessing to him. In other words, the abuser sought to confess to the abused as a way of shutting him up.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The impact of sexual abuse is lifelong and the adverse effects on a victim's mental wellbeing are widely documented. The act or acts eventually stop, but for too many the pain never does. Victims of child sexual abuse are more likely to suffer from anxiety and depression, alcohol and drug addiction, suicidal tendencies and many other mental conditions. Many victims of sexual abuse that I have spoken with say that the sheer act of seeking justice is an important part of the healing process and that the denial of justice, or the delay of justice, can be incredibly harmful to the mental health of victims. That is why I am concerned about the lack of urgency on David Cappo's part when it comes to this issue. It is clear that the seemingly low priority the Catholic Church in South Australia has given to this matter has caused great distress to John Hepworth. I question whether it is appropriate for a senior religious figure like David Cappo, who has responded this way to allegations of serious sexual and psychological abuse, to be given the important role of chair of the federal government's mental health task force. Tonight I am calling for two things to happen in relation to this matter. Firstly I am calling on the government to make a serious, detailed and formal inquiry into Monsignor Cappo's handling of Archbishop Hepworth's sexual assaults before any decision to appoint Monsignor Cappo to the Mental Health Commission is finalised. And I would further ask that John Hepworth be contacted directly as part of this inquiry. I am also calling for the Catholic Church in South Australia to immediately stand down this third priest from all his duties until these allegations are fully investigated. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">John Hepworth is a man of impeccable standing and he is unequivocal in the allegations he has made about the criminal behaviour of this priest. That alone should have been reason enough for David Cappo and Archbishop Wilson to immediately stand this priest down pending appropriate investigations. That has not happened, and right now there are parents sending their children to church unaware that their priest, in their parish, has been named as an abuser—a rapist. Shouldn't the Catholic Church be offering these parents a greater level of protection? I believe they should, and if they do not I will. So here is what I intend to do.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I will give the Catholic Church in South Australia until midday tomorrow to remove this priest from his post. If by midday tomorrow this hasn't happened, I intend to name the priest in question here in the Senate. David Cappo and the Catholic Church should have acted years ago. If they do not act now, I will. I do not make this decision lightly, and I have thought in great depth about the consequences of naming this individual in order to allow his parishioners the chance to make whatever choices they wish to. By naming him in the Senate, there is a chance that it may impact in some way on some future police investigation. But I have had to weigh this up with my responsibility to those who are in contact with this priest now. How do I respond to those from this parish who will no doubt say: 'You knew and you didn't say anything. How could you keep that knowledge from us?' The truth is, I do not have an answer to that, because I cannot see any moral reason to suppress this information. We have to act in the interests of parents and children in the parish first and foremost.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Given the detailed and serious allegations made by John Hepworth, and given his standing in the community and credibility as a scrupulously honest man—a good man—I feel I have no choice but to name this priest unless the Catholic Church stands him down immediately. One way or the other, this matter will be resolved tomorrow. I hope the Catholic Church in South Australia does the right thing, albeit belatedly.</span>

                  </a>  asked the Minister for Broadband, Communications and the Digital Economy, upon notice, on 16 March 2011:</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Small">With reference to digital television access in remote communities:</span>

              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Small">(1) Can the Minister confirm writing to around 140 remote Indigenous communities that run analogue television self-help transmission facilities, on or about 1 April 2010, to advise them of the options they had for converting to digital.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Small">(2) Is it a fact that one of the options provided in that letter was for the communities to set up a digital self-help television transmission facility.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Small">(3) In regard to a letter I received on 21 December 2010 indicating that the special equipment required to set up a Viewer Access Satellite Television (VAST) fed digital terrestrial facility would only become available in January 2011, could the department state exactly what assistance it might have provided those Indigenous communities to assess the option of setting up their own digital self-help transmission facility.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Small">(4) As a comparison, can an outline be provided of what the department and the Government have done to financially assist and inform homes within those communities to assess the option of converting to the new VAST satellite.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Small">(5) Is it a fact that, for 16 of the above remote Indigenous communities in North and far North Queensland, pressure is being exerted for them to finally decide, by 28 February, whether the households within those communities will convert to Direct-To-Home (DTH) from the new VAST satellite platform or set up their own digital terrestrial self-help transmission facility.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Small">(6) In developing the new VAST satellite platform and the Satellite Subsidy Scheme (SSS), announced nearly a year ago, what assessments had the department undertaken on remote Indigenous communities to develop knowledge about the:</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Small">(a) average number of television sets and recorder devices in homes which would need to be converted to digital;</span>

              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Small">(b) way in which Indigenous people watch television, particularly during the summer months when it is very hot inside homes;</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Small">(c) extent of insertion of local material into local self-help television transmissions; and</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Small">(d) extent to which indoor, cheap set top aerials only are needed for current terrestrial television reception.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Small">(7) I understand that the per home subsidy available to homes in, so called, remote Indigenous communities in Queensland to convert to the VAST satellite is $980, however, if an Indigenous home is located elsewhere in Queensland (for example, Quilpie or Normanton) the subsidy will be either $550 or $700 respectively – can an explanation be provided regarding the reasons for the difference, including exactly what consultation took place with remote Indigenous viewers when determining these figures. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Small">(8) At Estimates in May 2010, the department stated that the only currently available model of a VAST set top box cost approximately $269 (a cost now estimated at $280), whereas the Minister stated at the same time that an equivalent High Definition terrestrial set top box cost approximately $80, indicating that portable indoor aerials for terrestrial television reception are clearly less expensive than satellite dishes and mounts – is it therefore a fact that the total private and public subsidy cost of homes in remote Indigenous communities converting to digital via satellite is nearly always likely to be significantly more expensive than converting by terrestrial means. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Small">(9) Is it a fact that, after the satellite subsidy period expires, all new or replacement homes in remote Indigenous communities will be faced with the full, extra cost of VAST direct from satellite reception and that this will nearly always be more expensive than equivalent digital terrestrial reception. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Small">(10) Is it a fact that no businesses or public facilities in remote Indigenous communities, such as schools, health clinics and community facilities, will be eligible for the VAST satellite conversion subsidy.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Small">(11) What cost benefit studies has the department undertaken to compare, for example, the 10 year, full private and public cost of converting remote Indigenous communities (including new homes and businesses) to digital via VAST satellite or self-help digital terrestrial means and can details of any such cost benefit study be provided.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Small">(12) What is the view of the department regarding the ongoing private cost of maintaining satellite dishes and, in particular, smart cards for the VAST set top boxes in remote Indigenous communities.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Small">(13) Has the department conducted a detailed survey following the two recent cyclones in far North Queensland regarding the impact of cyclonic winds on individual DTH satellite dish installations.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Small">(14)  If Queensland local councils and remote Indigenous communities are being required to choose between DTH VAST or digital terrestrial self-help by 28 February and remote Indigenous homes in Queensland will be invited to opt into the Government’s per home subsidy scheme to assist them in converting to satellite on 20 April, what is the Government doing to assist remote Indigenous communities to develop robust digital self-help facility designs and to compare the overall benefits of converting to digital via VAST satellite or digital self-help terrestrial means before these deadlines.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Small">(15) Will the Government consider allowing remote Indigenous communities to pool their per home satellite subsidy payments and use this total amount to help pay for the establishment of a digital terrestrial self-help transmission facility; if not, what exactly is the basis for such a position.</span>

                    <span class="HPS-MemberAnswer">Senator Conroy:</span>
                  </a>  The answer to the honourable senator’s question is as follows:</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Small">(1) On or about 30 March 2010, I wrote to all 362 licensees of self help retransmission facilities to advise them of the options for converting to digital. This included about 265 licensees in remote areas of which about 87 operate self help facilities in about 112 remote indigenous communities.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Small">(2) Yes.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Small">(3) The department is not in a position to provide detailed technical and cost advice to communities about establishing digital self help facilities. The department provides general advice about the benefits of the Government-funded VAST satellite service, and has also written to a number of councils to ensure they are fully aware of the costs and other issues associated with setting up self help digital terrestrial towers. Decisions about whether or not to establish such facilities, or to upgrade existing facilities which are not on the broadcasters’ self-help upgrade list, are matters for the local community. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Small">(4) The department does not provide financial support to homes to assess the option of converting to the new VAST satellite.  </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Small">Licence holders of self help towers that are not converted to digital by broadcasters must make a choice whether or not to upgrade their facilities to digital themselves. If the decision is made by the licensee to not upgrade the facility, the community serviced by that tower will then be eligible for the Satellite Subsidy Scheme, to assist eligible households in meeting the cost of conversion to VAST. This recognises previous investment by these communities, usually through their rate payments, in maintaining local facilities. The amounts of the co-payment in each area will be made available to households in that area as part of the delivery of the Scheme, so that households have clear information of the cost to them of moving to VAST.  </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Small">(5) Between March 2010 and February 2011, the Minister and the department had a number of communications with self help licensees, including in Queensland. A final date of 20 June 2011 was set for councils in regional and remote Queensland to decide whether or not they wished to convert their own towers or allow their communities to move to the VAST service with assistance from the Satellite Subsidy Scheme.  It was made clear to councils that on that date it would be assumed that the Council would not be converting their tower, so SSS would start organising to deliver subsidised VAST installation to eligible households. These timeframes were needed to ensure that the Satellite Subsidy Scheme could be delivered to Queensland communities in a timely fashion in advance of switchover in regional Queensland in December.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Small">(6) The department has visited a number of Remote Indigenous Communities in Queensland, and also some in other parts of Australia, to refine its approach to delivering the Satellite Subsidy Scheme in those communities. Officers discussed with community members the viewing preferences of different households and communities, climactic conditions and other issues. This work is ongoing.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Small">Based on research undertaken by the department, there are up to 31,000 households in defined remote Indigenous communities across Australia that are likely to be eligible for the Satellite Subsidy Scheme.  The majority of these households are in remote Western Australia, Northern Territory, remote South Australia and far North Queensland.  The Scheme allows for the conversion of one television set per household to be met by Government at no cost to the household in Indigenous communities, and also allows for extra connections to be installed by the technician at the cost of the householder.   </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Small">While set top aerials potentially allow greater portability, it should be noted that many towers in remote communities are small with low powered transmitters, and reception by set top aerials may not be reliable.  Reliable reception would often require fixed roof top aerials, which would present the same issues regarding portability of sets (whether within or outside the home) as satellite receivers.  In addition, communities may not be in a position to properly maintain or provide a protected operating environment for the transmission equipment, meaning that services could be off air for extended periods.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Small">The extent to which local content insertion occurs in self-help television transmissions in remote Indigenous communities was considered in the recent review into Indigenous Broadcasting.  The Government is currently considering the report of the review.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Small">(7) Eligibility for the additional $280 assistance is based on a definition of remote Indigenous community widely accepted and used by many Government agencies.  The definition includes reference to a geographic location, bounded by physical boundaries, and inhabited predominantly by Aboriginal or Torres Strait Islander peoples with housing or infrastructure that is managed on a community basis.  This additional assistance will mean that, under the Satellite Subsidy Scheme, installations are essentially at no cost to the household in these communities.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Small">A clear definition for Indigenous communities, using accepted Government definitions, is necessary in order to allow for the successful delivery of the Scheme.  This allows whole communities to be provided with consistent services under the Scheme.  It is not feasible to deliver the Scheme in circumstances where different households or groups of households within a wider general population (eg Normanton) receive different types of service at different costs.  Moreover these towns often have better established local council structures and lower installation costs than very remote indigenous communities.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Small">The key cost from the household perspective is the co-payment actually paid by the household, not the amount of subsidy.  Contracts for delivery of the Scheme are negotiated on the basis of a single fixed co-payment cost per household in a switchover region or part of a switchover region, regardless of location, which to date has been between $200-$220 per household.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Small">(8) The Government gave extensive consideration to the merits of different options to ensure that all Australians are able to receive the same number of television channels, no matter where they live. A satellite service is required regardless of terrestrial upgrades – it is not feasible or economically viable to provide the full range of digital channels to virtually all Australians by terrestrial means alone.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Small">Accurate cost comparisons between terrestrial transmission and satellite are difficult to make because the upgrade and operating cost of terrestrial self-help retransmission facilities is potentially unique to each site, and the costs of installing direct-to-home satellite also vary.  For example, the upgrade of a self-help retransmission site might require complete replacement of all broadcasting infrastructure at a site, or it might require only some items to be upgraded if others are already suitable for digital transmission.  It might also require replacement or upgrade of the electricity supply and air conditioning at the site.  Ongoing operational costs for terrestrial retransmission will depend on the level of servicing provided, the time period over which any service contracts operate, and the timeframes for service responses. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Small">The costs of receiving digital terrestrial signals in homes and businesses will also vary depending on their location, number of receivers and the suitability of their existing antenna arrangements. For example, while some premises may be able to receive digital services with existing indoor antennas, others served by the same terrestrial site may need to modify or install a new external antenna or a high gain antenna with a masthead amplifier. Additionally, satellite delivery will incur one-off costs for consumers and broadcasters rather than the ongoing nature of terrestrial transmission costs for licensees.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Small">Conversion of terrestrial sites is also not ‘cost-free’ to householders. In addition to equipment needed in the home to receive digital signals, the costs of upgrading to digital, ongoing maintenance and transmission costs can be expected to be passed on to householders through their rates.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Small">(9) After the Satellite Subsidy Scheme period in an area expires, households in the area (new or existing) will not be able to receive a subsidy under the Scheme.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Small">(10) Yes. The government is not providing assistance to businesses or public facilities to convert to digital in any areas of Australia.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Small">(11) See answer A8 above.  The Government decided to implement a comprehensive satellite service to provide services in areas across Australia that are not served by digital terrestrial towers, and to support local communities to move to that service in cases where self help towers were not converted to digital.  The Government considers that satellite is an excellent option for communities not a second best solution. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Small">Each affected community is now able to offer their members a choice – whether to continue with the traditional terrestrial self-help transmission and pay for the upgrade and ongoing costs, or choose to avail themselves of the satellite TV service now being offered. This is a decision for each community to make and to weigh up the pros and cons that affect their community.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Small">(12) The Satellite Subsidy Scheme provides one-off to move to digital – its purpose is to assist conversion to digital, not to permanently subsidise television watching in communities.  The ongoing private cost of maintaining satellite dishes and smart cards is the responsibility of the householder, after the after-care period has expired.  This is consistent with households in all other areas of Australia that access the Satellite Subsidy Scheme.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Small">This is also consistent with many Indigenous households in remote areas that currently receive Aurora, the previous generation free-to-air satellite television, which continues to broadcast until 2013.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Small">(13) The department’s tender and contractual documents specify that the installations must meet the Building Code of Australia and Australian standards to ensure any installations provided under the SSS scheme are safe and fit for purpose in cyclonic areas of Australia.  Tens of thousands of Aurora, Austar and Foxtel satellite dishes in northern Australia have withstood many tropical cyclones and storms in recent years.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Small">(14) The Government has not provided assistance to any communities across Australia to explore the merits of different digital television transmission and reception options.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Small">(15) The government carefully considered proposals to allow for the ‘pooling’ of funds to support community-based terrestrial but did not support these for a range of policy and operational reasons.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Small">The government’s aim in the switchover process was to address, as much as possible, long-standing issues in regional and remote areas and ensure the delivery of the full suite of channels available in metropolitan areas through reliable, consistent and ‘future-proof’ infrastructure arrangements.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Small">The government considers that pooling of funds would not cover all the costs of converting self-help facilities, particularly in small communities.  In addition, the pooling of subsidies would result in a patchwork approach – providing various standards of service which would be a less than optimal outcome and inconsistent with the Government’s objective of providing equal television services to viewers in all parts of Australia. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Small">This would also make the program more complex, and therefore costly, to deliver. Allowing some councils to pool the subsidy would give rise to reduced economies of scale. It would also create an administratively complex scheme, requiring individual contractual arrangements with an unknown proportion of the 360 self-help licensees, layered on top of the current Satellite Subsidy Scheme model.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Small">(1) With reference to the Government commissioned report, 2008 Audit of the Defence Budget which identified that 'a real growth rate of 3.5 per cent in capital expenditure on SME [Specialised Military Equipment] [is required] just to replace today's equipment. To deliver the capabilities proposed in the recommended Force Structure Option requires a growth rate of 4.2 per cent': What will be the amount required to fund, in nominal dollars, the major capital equipment program each year from 2010-11 to 2029-30, so as to fund the White Paper 'Force 2030' initiatives.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Small">(2) With reference to the report, The Cost of Defence: ASPI Defence Budget Brief 2010 -11 which states, 'on the basis of long-term trends in defence costs, it is unlikely that the promised 2.2 per cent real growth post 2017-18 will be adequate to sustain let alone expand the ADF [Australian Defence Force] as planned. In other words, the plan was probably not affordable to begin with': Based on this analysis, as at 31 December 2010, how will the Government fund its Defence White Paper commitments when funding drops to 2.2 per cent real growth per annum, below that needed to sustain the ADF.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Small">(b) on 24 January 2011, Defence provided an update of between $215-$245 billion.  This reduction was due to the appreciation of the Australian dollar against the US dollar since that time.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Small">I have been advised by the Civil Aviation Safety Authority (CASA), Australia's independent aviation safety regulator, that it is aware of the claims aired in the "Dateline" program. However, CASA has also advised that the claims have not been substantiated by the US Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) which conducts oversight of aircraft manufacturing systems in the US, including the production of Boeing aircraft. CASA has also confirmed there have been no airworthiness directives issued in relation to claims made in the documentary.</span>

                  </a>  The answer to the honourable senator’s question is as follows:</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Small">I recognise that wireless audio devices provide a significant service and that there will be ongoing demand for spectrum for these devices.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Small">The reconfiguration of the digital dividend (700 MHz) band has been taking place now for some time, and will continue for a number of years to come. As part of this reconfiguration, the Australian Communications and Media Authority (ACMA) is working with the wireless audio device community, including the Australian Wireless Audio Group (AWAG), to make suitable provision for the operation of wireless audio equipment in the future.</span>

                </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Small">Questions (3), (5), (6), (7), (8), (9) and (10) are about the process and timing for migrating users of wireless audio devices out of the digital dividend band.    </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Small">While some users of wireless audio devices will have to relocate out of the digital dividend spectrum, it is likely that others will be able to continue to operate in this spectrum after it has been reconfigured. This is most likely to be within the guard bands and mid-band gap i.e. those parts of the digital dividend band that will be set aside for the purposes of mitigating interference. Further technical and engineering work is being undertaken before a final decision can be made on this issue. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Small">It is expected that users of wireless audio devices will be able to continue using the spaces between digital broadcasting services in the broadcasting spectrum below the digital dividend band (that is, below 694 MHz) going forward. The exact frequencies below 694 MHz in which wireless audio devices will be permitted to operate will able to be determined once planning for the reorganisation (restack) of digital broadcasting services, which is necessary to clear the digital dividend spectrum of broadcasting services, is completed nation-wide.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Small">I appreciate the importance of certainty to the wireless audio device community. Once the outcomes of this technical and planning work are known, the ACMA will commence the process of amending the Radiocommunications Class Licence (Low Interference Potential Devices) 2000 (the LIPD class licence) to put the frequency changes into effect.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Small">It is standard practice for the ACMA to communicate upcoming changes to licensing arrangements well in advance of the changes coming into effect, and to provide information to users, vendors and industry bodies to enable them to educate their customers and members about the changes. The ACMA is working to provide the wireless audio device community with sufficient time and information to make the necessary adjustments. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Small">Users of wireless audio devices will have until 31 December 2014 to vacate the spectrum.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Small">Any unauthorised use of wireless audio devices, in contravention of the LIPD class licence, would be open to compliance action by the ACMA. </span>

                </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Small">Questions (1), (2), (4), (11), (12), (13), (14), (15), (18), (19), (20), (21) and (22) seek factual information about the wireless audio device user base in Australia, the number of users likely to be impacted by the migration out of the digital dividend band, the user profile of those affected and the costs of migration.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Small">In its submission to the January 2010 Digital Dividend Green Paper, AWAG provided an estimate of the number of wireless audio devices currently using the broadcasting spectrum. It estimated that there were 130,000 devices in operation, with 80 per cent of these thought to be in the digital dividend spectrum range. A consultant’s report attached to the AWAG submission estimated the costs to industry of replacing equipment to be between $80 and $220 million.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Small">However, the extent of the migration required is heavily dependent on individual user circumstances such as their geographic location, existing frequency use and the ability of existing equipment to be re-tuned.  The impact on users cannot be properly calculated until the technical and planning work referred to above is completed. At this point in the process the ACMA should then be able to advise users of wireless audio equipment where in the spectrum they will be permitted to operate post-digital dividend. Users can then assess whether their existing equipment is able to operate in the new frequencies.  </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Small">In the meantime, the ACMA is working to provide the wireless audio device community with sufficient time and information to factor the migration into their planning and equipment purchasing cycles in order to minimise the costs associated with the migration. According to industry, vendors have been moving equipment imports away from the digital dividend band since 2009.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Small">As noted above, the ACMA is working with the wireless audio device community to make suitable provision for the operation of wireless audio equipment in the future. Technical and planning work is currently underway to achieve this.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">

Clearing the digital dividend spectrum will require wireless audio device users to relocate either to specified frequencies within the digital dividend band or to frequencies below the digital dividend band (i.e. below 694 MHz).</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Small">Wireless audio devices operate under a class licence. Access to the spectrum is free for these users and they operate on a no interference/no protection basis. Class licences can be varied or revoked by the Australian Communications and Media Authority (ACMA) at any time in urgent circumstances or, in any other circumstance, after consulting with affected licensees. </span>

                <span class="HPS-Small">The Digital Dividend Green Paper, released in January 2010, acknowledged the potential impact of realising the digital dividend on users of wireless audio devices, noting that operators of these devices may have to move frequencies and that there are likely to be costs associated with any move.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Small">The Australian Wireless Audio Group (AWAG), which represents the users of wireless audio devices, estimates that there are over 130,000 wireless audio devices using broadcasting spectrum, with 80 per cent of these operating in the digital dividend spectrum range. According to AWAG users range from churches, schools, sports and community groups and aerobics instructors to high-profile professional users in the film, radio and television production, performing arts, sport and recreation and hospitality sectors. If their devices are not sufficiently agile to retune to the new frequencies, there will likely be costs to these users in the form of equipment replacement costs. </span>

              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Small">In its response to the digital dividend green paper, AWAG estimated the costs to industry of replacing equipment to be between $80 and $220 million.</span>

              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Small">AWAG is seeking certainty on where in the spectrum users will be permitted to operate post-digital dividend, and the timing of any moves. It has also raised the prospect of the Government paying compensation to assist users meet the costs of replacing equipment associated with the move. It argues that the Government requires ‘clean’ spectrum (i.e. spectrum free of wireless audio device users) to maximise revenues from the sale of the spectrum. The Department and the ACMA have been working with AWAG on these issues.</span>
              </p>

              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Small">Users of wireless audio devices will be able to continue using the spectrum between digital broadcasting services below the digital dividend band (i.e. below 694 MHz). However, the exact location of the available frequencies will not be known until planning for the restack is completed. It is at this point in the restack process that channels will have been assigned to each digital broadcasting service and it will therefore become apparent which channels will be available for use by wireless audio devices. The current internal timetable for restacking has planning completed nation-wide by the end of 2012. However, there is still some potential for movement and this timing has not been made public. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Small">While some users of wireless audio devices will have to relocate out of the digital dividend spectrum, it is likely that others will be able to continue to operate in this spectrum after it has been reconfigured. This is most likely to be within the guard bands and mid-band gap i.e. those parts of the digital dividend band that will not be used for mobile wireless communications due to the need to manage interference. Once the ACMA completes its work on the technical framework for the digital dividend spectrum licences it will be able to confirm the feasibility of this proposal. This work is due to be completed by the end of 2011.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Small">Users of wireless audio devices will be required to vacate the digital dividend spectrum by 31 December 2014. To achieve this, the ACMA will need to amend the relevant class licence to change the range of frequencies in which these users will be permitted to operate going forward. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Small">The ACMA’s standard practice is to communicate upcoming changes to spectrum licensing arrangements well in advance of the changes coming into effect, and to provide information to users, vendors and industry bodies to enable them to educate their customers and members about the changes. According to AWAG, vendors have been moving equipment imports away from the digital dividend band since 2009.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Small">As indicated above, definitive information on the availability of frequencies below 694 MHz for wireless audio equipment use will not be available until the end of 2012. From this time, users would have two years to transition out of the spectrum. AWAG has previously indicated that users would need two years to transition.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Small">The Department met with AWAG representatives in March 2011. At this meeting AWAG agreed to develop a work plan and communications strategy for the transition of wireless audio device users out of the digital dividend spectrum. AWAG will be meeting with the ACMA to discuss this work plan on 16 August 2011.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Small">It is possible that some users of wireless audio devices could, in contravention of their class licence, continue to operate equipment within the digital dividend band despite changes to the class licence. Any unauthorised use of wireless audio devices would be open to compliance action by the ACMA. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Small">Preliminary studies performed by the ACMA suggest that unauthorised use of wireless audio devices in the digital dividend spectrum has the potential to cause interference to both mobile broadband services and wireless audio systems. Depending on the specific situation, it is possible that simultaneous interference could occur, or that only one of the systems would experience interference. It can be expected that, where wireless audio equipment experiences interference of this nature, users would be further encouraged to vacate the band. The potential for some limited unauthorised use is unlikely to impact auction revenues.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Small">Whether users will have to move is heavily dependent on individual user circumstances such as their geographic location, existing frequency use and the ability of existing equipment to be re-tuned.  </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Small">AWAG has undertaken substantial work on these issues, including conducting an economic study of use of wireless audiovisual devices in Australia and case studies of how wireless audio equipment is used by Australian community organisations and business. </span>

              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Small">However, the number of users that will need to change frequencies and replace equipment, and the costs involved, can only be calculated once it is known where in the spectrum they will be operating post-digital dividend. Users can then assess whether their existing equipment is able to operate in the new frequencies. As indicated above, this is unlikely before the end of 2012. </span>

                    <span class="HPS-MemberAnswer">Senator Ludwig:</span>
                  </a>  The Minister for Home Affairs has provided the following answer to the honourable senator's question:</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Small">
                  <span style="font-weight:bold;" />(1) There have been 18 public referrals to Customs and Border Protection, relating to 16 separate instances, alleging that prohibited cat or dog fur products have been imported. In addition, ten other consignments were detained by Customs and Border Protection at the time of importation for assessment as a result of its cargo risk assessment program.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Small">   (a)<span style="font-weight:bold;"></span>All referrals have been followed up and investigated. Where appropriate, importers have been required to submit detailed documents or garments for independent testing and analysis.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Small">Four cases resulted in the goods being seized and destroyed, either because the importer could not provide sufficient information to identify the goods, or the goods were abandoned. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Small">   (b)<span style="font-weight:bold;"></span>No. Prosecution of these four cases was not initiated because, in the circumstances, this action was not considered to be in accordance with the Prosecution Policy of the Commonwealth. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Small">   (c) Nil. Where appropriate, goods believed to have contained cat or dog fur have been seized and destroyed at the border while under Customs control.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Small">(2) Customs and Border Protection assesses all imported cargo as part of its broader risk assessment and border enforcement program.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Small">Where Customs and Border Protection is concerned about the importation of fur products, including cases of suspected false labelling, importers are required to provide suitable documentation to identify the type of fur being imported. In circumstances where the fur cannot be identified and Customs and Border Protection has a reasonable suspicion that the goods are cat or dog fur products, a sample will be provided to an appropriate expert to determine the type of fur being imported. Where allegations are confirmed and a breach has occurred, Customs and Border Protection will seize the goods.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Small">(3) Customs and Border Protection represents the interests of over 40 government agencies at the border, dealing with over 70 separate types of regulated goods. These goods range from counterfeit luxury goods, to illicit drugs, child pornography and weapons of mass destruction.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Small">Funding is allocated by government to treat all of those risks, and is applied using an intelligence-led, risk-based approach. The control on dog and cat fur is administered within the overall allocation of funding for this wide range of prohibited, restricted and regulated goods, and is managed within our risk assessment and border enforcement program. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Small">(4) Staff resources are not allocated to specific risks for regulated goods; they are applied according to Customs and Border Protection's risk assessment processes.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Small">Depending on the level of risk identified and the intelligence available, tasking can be allocated to any officer undertaking relevant duties. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Small">(5) The Humane Society International (HSI) has made multiple allegations of dog fur importation to the Australian Customs and Border Protection Service in 2011. These allegations have been investigated and HSI has been advised by Customs and Border Protection of the outcomes of these matters. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Small">The allegations made by HSI were based on two tests which indicated the potential presence of dog fur in certain garments. However, one of those tests indicated the fur may be from a species of animal that is not prohibited.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Small">Customs and Border Protection investigated the allegations, and engaged directly with the two importers. Each importer withdrew the goods from sale, pending independent testing. These tests, from credible independent scientific authorities, did not support the allegations made by HSI. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Small">Customs and Border Protection will continue to monitor and assess potential breaches of the dog and cat fur prohibition, as part of its work in enforcing border control over a range of prohibited, restricted and regulated goods, within its risk based border enforcement framework.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Small">(b) The advertisement was created and placed specifically to raise awareness and educate North American institutional/wholesale investors about the Commonwealth Government Securities (CGS) market.  This sector of the offshore investor base is believed to be relatively in-active in Australian dollar denominated bonds.  The AOFM has an objective of diversifying the CGS investor base, particularly where there is likely to be interest in the long-end of the CGS yield curve.  This supports the announced strategy to issue a fifteen-year Treasury Bond.</span>
