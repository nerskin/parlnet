                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">
                    <a href="JKM" type="MemberSpeech">
                      <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Senator McKIM</span>
                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Tasmania</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">10:01</span>):  When this debate adjourned last week I was speaking about the nature of this bill, the Migration Amendment (Character Cancellation Consequential Provisions) Bill, specifically about the fact that it extends the minister's power to cancel visas and, in fact, not only allows him to overrule decisions made by officials of his department but gives him the power to overturn a decision of a review tribunal. As I was pointing out, that exempts him from the rules of natural justice.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">It is also worth the Senate's noting that these amendments also mean that those subject to a minister's cancellation power could be detained if there is a mere reasonable suspicion that the minister might cancel their visa—in effect, allowing the government to pre-empt a ruling by the judicial system. Another way of putting that, of course, is to presume a person guilty before they have an opportunity to prove their innocence. In that context, it is worth noting also that in Australia these days you can be retained in prison for something you might do in the future. It is an incredibly Orwellian series of amendment bills that we are seeing this government bring before the parliament, that continue an erosion of the human rights and civil liberties in this country that so many Australians have fought to protect over the last century and more, and for which so many Australians have, tragically, died.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This bill removes important procedural safeguards which deprive those affected of information regarding their legal and administrative options. We are talking here about people who are potentially in prison, people who are already extremely vulnerable people and who may not know their rights, who may not know the law and who in some cases may not even speak or understand English to a satisfactory level.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The Refugee Council of Australia summed it up very well, in the Australian Greens view, in their submission to the inquiry into the bill. They said the bill 'compounds the grave unfairness' of provisions introduced in 2014, including:</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">… automatic cancellation of visas on certain grounds, new personal powers of the Minister to set aside decisions by the Administrative Appeals Tribunal or Departmental officers, and increasing the circumstances in which a person would fail the 'character test'.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-SmallBullet" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-SmallBullet">The powers have the practical effect of depriving a person of liberty and the right of residence in this country at the virtually unfettered discretion of the Minister, without any real review.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">That is the problem in this bill, articulated in a nutshell, very succinctly and clearly, by the Refugee Council of Australia. It is the Greens submission to the Senate that there is a lack of procedural fairness in the amendments proposed and an absence of appropriate safeguards in the new cancellation process. Of course, submissions to the inquiry into the bill reflect that. Those submissions include that of the Refugee Council of Australia but are not limited to that one. The Greens will not be supporting this unfair bill.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">During my second reading contribution last week I foreshadowed that the Greens would be moving a second reading amendment, so now I move the amendment on sheet 8040 revised:</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">At the end of the motion, add "but the Senate is of the opinion that the Australian Parliament should have the right to deny entry to any Head of State or Head of Government on character grounds".</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I want to speak briefly to this amendment. At the moment, character test provisions are indeed in place, thanks to the construct of the existing act. However, they are to be applied by the minister for immigration. We have no confidence that the current minister for immigration will apply the character test as constructed in the act in any reasonable way at all.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We want to be clear that we are only talking here about a potential entry by a head of state or head of government. One of the reasons we think the parliament should have the capacity to make this decision is that visits by heads of state or heads of government are inevitably very symbolic visits. The things that happen while a head of government is here are widely reported in the media, and whether or not Australia as a country allows a head of state to visit our country is something that will influence the political conversation in this country and something that a lot of Australians will feel very strongly about.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Rather than the consideration around the character of a head of state or head of government happening inside the minister's head, which is where it happens at the moment under the current provisions of the act, we think that the parliament should have the right to make that determination. In other words, the parliament should be able to have a debate about whether a head of state or head of government can come into Australia in the context of that person's character. We could have the debate in front of the Australian people, in front of the media who report on what we do in this place. It is effectively a motion which allows for sunlight to be shone on an assessment of the character of a foreign head of state or head of government. We believe an appropriate mechanism would be for any senator to be able to effectively move a disallowance motion that would allow the Senate to reject the entry of a foreign head of state or head of government on character grounds.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I am not going to make any bones about this. This was crystallised for us by the election of Donald Trump as the US president, and I said that publicly last week. We would submit that, on any reasonable assessment of Mr Trump's character, he would fail the character test. He has greenlighted sexual assault on women. He has mocked people with disabilities. He is undermining fundamental rule of law in the United States. There have been any number of actions taken by Mr Trump and words uttered by Mr Trump, whether they be in interviews, press conferences or via his Twitter account, that call into serious question his character. Voting against this motion put forward by the Greens would effectively be the parliament voting to deny itself the opportunity to make their views heard on this matter. So I do commend this amendment to the Senate. </span>

This is a bill that the Labor Party will be supporting. We will be supporting this bill because it is consequential to the Migration Amendment (Character and General Visa Cancellation) Act 2014, which Labor has also supported. The 2014 act was designed to strengthen the existing character and general visa cancellation provisions within the Migration Act to ensure that noncitizens who commit crimes in Australia and pose a risk to the Australian community or represent an integrity concern are appropriately considered for visa refusal or cancellation.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I want to commend the minister for this piece of legislation and for working with the Labor Party and other parties to make sure it is a reasonable and sensible bill. I want to put on the record that there are red lines when it comes to these types of legislation and the position of the Labor Party. I note this is also the position the government has had very strongly. The idea of banning people outright based on ethnicity or religion as whole groups is not something that should or can be supported. This bill strengthens the provisions that allow case-by-case assessment. There are individuals that should be banned. There are individuals who should not be here. Those people should not be here in their role as individuals. But the idea of wholescale migration bans—Muslim bans, whatever you want to call them—is not something that we support. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">But I have to say there has been a lot of talk recently about a Muslim ban. There has been talk of a Muslim ban by other members of this chamber, other senators proposing they want to take this type of legislation further and go all out towards banning Muslims. All of this talk of a Muslim ban has me very worried for my friend Nazeem Hussain. Nazeem is currently stuck in Africa on the show,<span style="font-style:italic;"> I'm a Celebrity…Get Me Out </span><span style="font-style:italic;">o</span><span style="font-style:italic;">f Here</span>. While many of us who know him have questioned over the years whether he is or is not actually a celebrity, that is beside the point. Someone needs to get the message to Nazeem that there are people in this chamber who are not only proposing a Muslim ban but, even worse, have told me privately they will vote for Steve Price. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Last night I was devastated to see Tom Arnold get sent home and not Nazeem. Nazeem is being funny, likeable, talented and charming. He does not belong on this show. Nazeem, if we do not get you back to Australia soon, mate, they might get a Muslim ban up here and you will be stuck in Africa indefinitely. Of course, some people might say they want to vote for you to send a strong message about multiculturalism, but that is little comfort when you spend the rest of your life eating non-halal food in Africa, nursing your winning trophy. There are only so many job opportunities for a Waleed Aly impersonator in Cape Town. We need to get Nazeem out of there. So I say to Nazeem's friends, Karl Chandler, Tommy Dassalo and the Little Dum Dum Club, I am going to say something that you will never hear Senator Hanson ever say in the chamber: let's kick this ethnic out, but bring him to Australia. Thank you. </span>

                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">
                    <a href="266524" type="MemberSpeech">
                      <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Senator ROBERTS</span>
                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Queensland</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">10:14</span>): As a servant to the people of Queensland and Australia, I rise to speak to the Migration Amendment (Character Cancellation Consequential Provisions) Bill 2016. This bill is a welcome first step in a set of policies proposed and supported by Pauline Hanson's One Nation party. We see the bill as a beginning in moving the discussion on a core issue of concern to Australians across our nation, from the quantity of immigration to the quality of immigration. When we talk about quality, we talk about the willingness and ability of immigrants to assimilate. May we remind all parliamentarians that governments have three core responsibilities: to protect life, to protect property and to protect freedom. As part of our sworn duties we have a solemn responsibility to preserve social cohesion, which flows from a secure sense of national identity.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I say to the establishment among us in this chamber who want to understand the Trump phenomenon and the Brexit phenomenon and Pauline Hanson's phenomenal success: to understand what drives people's needs, what people are saying to us as we travel and listen across this great country, we all need to get to the root of people's economic concerns. To everyday Australians, jobs matter. That is why we need to cut immigration quantity. More importantly, social cohesion matters—so does trust, so does a sense of belonging. These are all qualities that tap into people's sense of achievement, and if people have no job and the government cannot support them because they are burdened by non-assimilating immigrants, they feel ostracised in their own country, forgotten, taken advantage of.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Culture and integration matter to Australians. These values are undermined by rapid diversity, especially when Islam is in the mix. The Scanlon surveys of social cohesion conducted annually out of Monash University demonstrate our point specifically: social cohesion is important to Australians. Dr Frank Salter, the One Nation academic researcher in sociological matters, has reviewed the international literature on diversity, including extensive studies from Harvard University. The data supports what we say about cohesion. Global studies converge with the Australian data. As much as the Greens try, the data cannot be hidden, because people see it and feel it every day, all around them. Senator Hanson has been talking about social cohesion for as long as she has been on the national stage. In her first speech as a senator, she talked about how precious a sense of belonging really is, as well as trust. She said, 'It is about belonging, commitment to fight for, protect and respect. This will never be traded or given up for diversity.'</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Social cohesion comes from national identity, and that is something that grows organically. It cannot be legislated. It cannot be imposed top down by condescending politicians and bureaucrats—the establishment elites. It cannot be created by naming government departments 'Multicultural Affairs'. Social cohesion can come only from the people. But it can be wrecked by sloppy governments, as Minister Dutton courageously admitted last year when he chided his own party for its immigration policies of the 1980s. For his courage Minister Dutton was pilloried by the Labor-Green coalition that fails to understand the essence of national cohesion and identity. Everyone gets it, except for the chattering classes. Instead of no nation, we must have one nation.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">My colleague Senator Burston in his first speech noted the social research science on diversity and social cohesion. The research has been done overseas and in Australia. The data indicates that the social fabric in this country is fraying, and that is why voters are deserting the old parties. The fraying of our identity was foretold, was predicted, was warned of. The Liberal and Labor parties imposed permanent mass immigration without taking national identity into account or even asking voters' permission. Senator Burston spoke of the coldness and arrogance of our political elites, and I fully support his views.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Poverty—that is, an individual's economic situation—cannot explain why more Muslims have tried to volunteer to fight in the Middle East for outlawed Islamist forces than are presently in the Australian armed forces fighting in that theatre. Economics cannot explain why Australians are fleeing areas of heavy migrant settlement, especially Islamic settlement. This is not only white flight, it is every kind of flight. Every type of Australian is fleeing these new ghettos. In our fraying society, self-segregation has become a reality. We the people are seeking to protect our children, our daughters, our property, our liberty.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">There are solutions to these problems that go beyond what is proposed in this bill. If we applied international standards of social impact assessment to the selection of immigrants, the gradual process of assimilation would begin to restore social cohesion, belonging and trust. How can we expect people who are wedded to an ideology masquerading as a religion that specifically precludes assimilation to assimilate and integrate? We cannot.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Pauline Hanson's One Nation is willing to say the things that need to be said and do the things that need to be done. We listen to the people of Australia across our nation and implement the policies people have asked us to champion. A common question I am asked is: how many Australians complain of or are afraid of Buddhists, who comprise a larger proportion of our nation than those of Islamic ideology? Australians do not complain about Buddhists, or Sikhs, or Hindus, or Jews or Catholics or Protestants and so on.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">So it is not only the scale of immigration that counts but the content—the quality. If immigrants are to assimilate we should be choosing those from cultures with a track record of ready assimilation. That is why we need to congratulate the minister for immigration for his success in the implementation of the operational plan to take control of our country's borders, after the open borders policies of Labor-Greens coalition. It is no wonder that a recent Channel 7 poll found the number of supporters of a ban on Islamic immigration all but matched those opposing a ban. Do I need to remind that a poll last year from even the control-oriented Essential polling group found that more people supported a ban on Islamic immigration than opposed it? That Essential poll showed that over one-third of Greens voters supported a ban on Islamic immigration. What was the Greens leader's response? Of course, being left wing—that is, control oriented—Senator Di Natale said his party needed to do more educating. Isn't that so typical of the Greens? Speaking to sell, not listening to learn.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">That reminds us all that under the Greens labelling and demonising of those with whom they disagree debate in Australia has been shut down. That is why people across Australia are asking what is happening to our nation. Senator Bernardi rightly said that the political elites and establishment are now being held accountable, and he left his party to join with us in holding the old establishment accountable.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This bill is the first step in the crawl towards the conversation that needs to be had on quality of immigration. The parliament needs to get away from window dressing and face core issues. We need all remember that we do not lock our home at night because we hate the people outside; we lock our home because we love the people inside. The real division in politics is not the confected and vague labels of Left versus Right or regressives versus conservatives; it is control versus freedom. In this case, to protect personal freedoms within Australia we must protect our borders.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We in Pauline Hanson's One Nation party value diverse views, and we welcome those of varied religions and races and skin colours and ethnic groups and political persuasions within our borders who have assimilated. We value our nation, our Constitution our laws and our culture. Assimilation and integration occur only when the pace, or quantity, of immigration does not swamp the host culture and when the quality of immigration focuses on people with the intent, willingness and ability to assimilate. We need to cancel visas of people with a criminal history. This bill is an important first step, and we support the character and visa amendment, because instead of no nation we must have one nation.</span>

It is important to note that the measures in this bill have previously been reviewed by the Senate Legal and Constitutional Affairs Legislation Committee.

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">A key amendment made by the Migration Amendment (Character and General Visa Cancellation) Act was the introduction of mandatory visa cancellation for noncitizens in jail serving a full-time custodial sentence of imprisonment and who have been sentenced to 12 months imprisonment or have been found guilty of sexually-based offences involving a child. The vast majority of noncitizens who have had their visas cancelled under the mandatory cancellation powers are repeat offenders with multiple criminal convictions in Australia or serious or violent offenders. The amendments to the bill the Senate is currently debating are important consequential amendments that will ensure that the character and cancellation provisions in the Migration Act operate effectively as intended following amendments made in December 2014 by the Migration Amendment (Character and General Visa Cancellation) Act 2014.</span>

There are special visa arrangements in place for certain categories of people, such as guests of government and members of the royal family, and this includes heads of state and foreign dignitaries. I commend the bill to the Senate.</span>

                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Tasmania</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">10:44</span>):  The Migration Amendment (Character Cancellation Consequential Provisions) Bill 2016 is important legislation which I do support because it will strengthen our national security and it will be safer for Tasmanian families if this legislation passes the Senate. Therefore, I am happy to vote for it. That is not to say that it could not be improved. One of the main purposes of the Migration Amendment (Character Cancellation Consequential Provisions) Bill 2016 is to amend the Migration Act 1958 to, principally, amend the definition of a 'character concern' to be consistent with character tests in subsection 501(6) of the act. I agree with the government's proposal to, firstly, provide for mandatory cancellation of the visa of a person who was serving a prison sentence where the minister is satisfied that the person fails the character test as they have a substantial criminal record or have been found guilty of a sexually based offence involving a child; and, secondly, provide that a person does not pass the character test if there is a 'risk' rather than the previous 'significant risk' that they will pose a danger to the Australian community.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I ask the minister: who will be given additional or broadened powers under this legislation to refuse or cancel visas of people wanting to live or visit Australia and to give some thought as to whether those prospective visitors share our democratic beliefs and respect the liberties and human rights which automatically come with our love for a democratic system of government? A prospective visitor or immigrant's attitude to our system of democratic life in Australia should always be taken into account when our immigration minister makes a decision whether to ban a visitor or stop an immigrant from becoming a permanent Australian citizen. After all, our oath of allegiance states that, as an Australian citizen, 'I pledge my loyalty to Australia and its people, whose democratic beliefs I share'. If immigrants and prospective citizens do not share our democratic beliefs then it should automatically disqualify them from becoming citizens. That should be no questions asked. If you want to visit Australia and you do not share our democratic beliefs, that should at least ensure our immigration minister has a second look at them and their visa application, asking who they are loyal to and why they do not like democracies. This is the vetting that should be done.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">If the answer is that they are loyal to people and organisations that are at war with Australia, our allies, our soldiers, our seamen and our airmen then that person should not be allowed into our country. That is why I believe Donald Trump is on the right track following his temporary ban on people from countries where sharia law is part of that nation's culture. A country which allows sharia law to be practised and enforced obviously does not share our democratic values or respect basic human rights for women, gay people, teenagers, young girls and all Jewish people. Support for sharia law is a clear sign of Islamic radicalisation and support for Australia's enemies, so I ask that the immigration minister consider a better screening process for Australia with regard to those who support sharia law. Why is the question not even asked?</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">On the shores of Lake Burley Griffin, written into the cement are the words of the oath of allegiance to Australia. I have thought a lot about these words—since I have been in parliament, more so. As an Australian citizen, I affirm my loyalty to Australia and its people, whose democratic beliefs I share. The oath continues, but, for the moment, I would like to talk about this simple but very profound beginning, which I believe has great meaning with regard to this legislation.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">It is a sad fact that many people living in Australia, enjoying the safety, benefits and lifestyle of living in a first-world country, are disloyal to Australia and its people. Many people have divided or split loyalties with other countries, as witnessed by dual citizenships or support for Australian enemies. Our Constitution recognises the inherent danger to Australia from people living here who have split or divided loyalties and officially discriminates against those people by stopping them from standing for elected positions in this parliament. The precedent has already been set. Many of those people do not share our democratic beliefs and do not appreciate the sacrifices that previous generations of Australians made to keep our nation free and democratic.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">People who support the imposition of sharia law in Australia or any other country obviously do not share our beliefs in democracy or in our rights and liberties. How could someone who thinks it is okay to kill someone simply because they are gay or Jewish share our democratic beliefs? How could someone who thinks it is okay for women to be treated like possessions of men and like second- or third-class citizens share Australian democratic beliefs? Sharia law is not Australian law. Terrorists want to force it on the rest of the world; that has been made quite clear. It is antidemocratic. Show me a successful democracy in the Middle East that imposes the death penalty on gay people for being gay, imposes the death penalty on women who are unfaithful to their husband and denies the right of the Jewish people to live in peace in Israel. Accepting the supposedly good bits of sharia law gives legitimacy to the bad bits of sharia law. That is rubbish. Sharia law is an antidemocratic cancer that does not belong in a free society and fails to respect the human rights of women, gays and Jews.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">All I am asking is that we screen people for their support for sharia law. If they support sharia law and want it in Australia do not let them in—that would be your first mistake. Such people are obviously supporters of the terrorists, their law and their culture.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">In closing, I take this opportunity to support Senator Bernardi's call to halve our overall immigration rate, and also to remind people that I want our foreign aid halved. I have one question for the minister, which I would liked answered: how many of the 190 people that ASIO is currently watching—I am going through older statistics here—have had their dual citizenship cancelled, or at least vetted?</span>

For the purposes of this debate I might call them the association provisions. What is the burden of proof, if any, that the minister has to achieve. I understand that it has to be a reasonable suspicion, but what does 'reasonable suspicion' mean? Can the minister provide the Senate with any case law or jurisprudence on this that can, hopefully, confirm that the minister is cognisant of that case law, if any, when making decisions? Secondly, is the minister able to apply this particular provision to a foreign leader and deny any foreign leader on the basis of his or her associations?</span>

Would support for sharia law, for the coalition, be a reasonable excuse to stop someone from coming into the country? That is simply all the Australian people want to know. I am simply asking, through the chair, for a response from the minister—yes or no.</span>

They provide that the minister is able to deny a visa on the basis of a foreign court convicting a noncitizen of certain things. Did the government consider Australia's international human rights obligations, which require Australia not to be complicit in trials that do not comply with accepted fair trial principles? I do not see an exemption in here for a foreign court. You and I and all senators know that there are some so-called legal proceedings in some countries around the world which fail the basic tests of natural justice. If someone is convicted, in effect, by a kangaroo court in a foreign jurisdiction, is the minister able to exercise discretion and ensure that that conviction, if it has been arrived at outside the principles of natural justice, does not automatically mean that a visa is cancelled—so, in fact, the minister has the discretion to ignore such a conviction?</span>

The last matter I want to raise is a matter I raised last week. I am not sure if you were in the chamber or not, so I will go over it very quickly. We have seen an explosion in visas cancelled on character grounds over the last few years. I put the numbers on the record last week; rather than go through them again, I will just say that there has been a very significant increase since the previous round of amendments were made a few years ago. You may or may not have information here. If you do not, I am very happy for you take it on notice and come back to me. I am interested in the workload for the department and also for the minister's office here, given that explosion in the number of visas of various classes cancelled on character grounds. Could you also inform the Senate of the length of time that it has taken the department as well as the minister's office to process such matters. Perhaps you could come back with the average length of time, and what costs there are to the taxpayer, specifically in relation to the potential longer detention of larger numbers of people.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Regarding the issue that you raise generally, I believe you may have raised it in in relation to the findings of  a recent Commonwealth Ombudsman's report. The response I have received from the minister, specifically in terms of the Commonwealth Ombudsman's report into the administration of section 501 of the Migration Act, is that the department has, over the past 12 months, significantly improved its management of the section 501 case load. However, given the time frame in which the report was actually prepared, some of these improvements are not reflected in the final document. The improvements that have been made include streamlining administrative processes to expedite cancellation and revocation decisions, and expanding the capacity to make decisions at an earlier stage in a noncitizen's custodial sentence. The advice I am given is that these initiatives have already seen a gradual decline in the overall number of section 501 cases in detention. The minister's department will provide you with the actual statistical information that you requested.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">
                    <a href="00AOU" type="MemberSpeech">
                      <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Senator WONG</span>
                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">South Australia</span>—<span class="HPS-MinisterialTitles">Leader of the Opposition in the Senate</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">11:07</span>):  I rise to speak on the Privacy Amendment (Notifiable Data Breaches) Bill 2016<span style="font-style:italic;"></span>on behalf of the opposition. The opposition will be supporting this legislation. We welcome this bill which has been much delayed in its introduction by this government. We support the bill because it is actually a Labor bill. It is nearly identical to a bill that passed the House with bipartisan support some four years ago, but which lapsed at the election in 2013. It has taken this government that long to re-introduce this bill. Really, it ought to have been one of the first things on the Attorney-General's agenda, but, as we know, he has been distracted with a few other things.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Let me outline why this bill is important and why we thought fit to introduce it four years ago. As it stands, an individual's personal data can be breached by a government agency, a bank or an online store and there be no requirement that the individual be notified so that they can change their passwords or take other measures to protect themselves. A person might be told tomorrow that their data was hacked four years ago, and that organisation would face no consequences for its failure to notify them at the time. This is the situation that this government and this Attorney-General has let linger thanks to an inexplicable inertia on this important issue.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Let us have a look, briefly, at the history. In 2013, Mr Dreyfus, the then Attorney-General, introduced the Privacy Amendment (Privacy Alerts) Bill. That bill, like this one, made it mandatory for regulated entities under the Privacy Act to alert consumers when their personal data had been breached, whether through accident or malice.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The 2013 bill followed an extensive report by the Australian Law Reform Commission in 2008 which recommended that the Privacy Act be amended to provide as follows:</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">An agency or organisation is required to notify the Privacy Commissioner and affected individuals when specified personal information has been, or is reasonably believed to have been, acquired by an unauthorised person and the agency, organisation or Privacy Commissioner believes that the unauthorised acquisition may give rise to a real risk of serious harm to any affected individual.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">And a failure to notify would result in a civil penalty. The Australian Law Reform Commission went on to clarify that 'specified personal information' should include personal information as well as sensitive personal information—for instance, a unique identifier that links someone's Medicare number to their name and address.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">After extensive consultation, Labor responded to that recommendation with the privacy alerts bill, which was introduced on 29 May 2013.  That bill had bipartisan support and passed the House of Representatives, but, sadly, lapsed at the election in 2013 before it could pass in this place. We have all been waiting for this government to do something about this. We waited patiently, but the government was far more interested in picking partisan fights than passing sensible law with bipartisan support. In particular, one would have to say, the Abbott government would have had to be one of the least constructive governments in Australia's recent history.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">With the total absence of action from the Abbott government, the opposition introduced a private senator's bill in 2014 to the same effect as the 2013 bill. That lapsed at the hastily organised 2016 election. The best we got from the Abbott-Turnbull government in the 43rd Parliament was a fig leaf of an exposure draft which was released in 2015 but progressed nowhere. That came after a recommendation of the Parliamentary Joint Committee on Intelligence and Security on mandatory retention of metadata to the effect that a mandatory data breach notification scheme be introduced by the end of 2015. That was agreed by the government in its response to the committee's recommendation. Yet, here we are in 2017 and we have only just got this bill in the Senate. Given that history, we on this side of the chamber do find it somewhat baffling as to why the government has been so tardy in bringing this bill forward—four years to introduce a simple, straightforward bill that has bipartisan support.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Many Australians would be shocked to learn that it is not already mandatory for agencies or companies to notify them when their personal data has been breached. If consumers are not informed that their personal data has been breached for months or even years after the fact, it certainly removes any capacity to take remedial action. Significant loss of funds and identity theft cannot be easily avoided. Those affected cannot change their credit card details and they cannot keep a watch for suspicious activity. They are powerless, in effect, because they are not aware. That is not unacceptable.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">While the government has waited and delayed, the situation has worsened. A prime example is the Catch of the Day case, where the personal data of some or all of its two million customers was hacked and stolen in 2011 but the customers were not told until 2014. This, quite rightly, caused outrage. Moreover, the company did not even report the hack to the Australian Federal Police when it happened but waited three years. This bill is designed to prevent exactly this kind of situation. Corporations, or public service departments, ought not be allowed to delay reporting of a serious breach of personal data simply because of the fear of the damage it might cause to their reputation. They should disclose to affected customers as soon as the breach is known, regardless of any embarrassment to them. Australians are entitled to know so that they can act to protect themselves.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Section 26WA of the bill sets out the threshold test for the eligible data breach. It provides that such a breach happens if it is 'likely to result in serious harm'. In contrast, the threshold test in the Privacy Amendment (Privacy Alerts) Bill 2013 was 'real risk of serious harm'. The test 'likely to result in serious harm' could be seen as a slightly higher threshold than the previous bill, particularly when combined with the list of relevant matters for consideration to help guide whether harm is likely or unlikely.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The Australian Law Reform Commission report <span style="font-style:italic;">For your information: Australian privacy law and practice</span> noted that in international law the terms 'likelihood' and 'real risk' are similar and related. The term 'a real risk of serious harm' has been defined to mean a reasonable degree of likelihood, real and substantial danger, and a real and substantial risk. The law council, in their submission on the exposure draft of the bill, expressed concern that the 'real risk' test, as drafted, was unclear. They view the 2016 bill as an improvement on the exposure draft version of the bill. The new test responds to stakeholder concerns about the practicality of determining what degree of probability and what kind of harm would be captured in the phrase 'real risk of serious harm'. It will provide greater certainty for regulated entities to be able to comply with their obligations.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I want to turn now, briefly, to the handling of personal data. The protections for consumers contained in this bill become even more vital with the worrying trend of this government to outsource the handling of personal data from the public to the private sector. This includes the proposed sell-off of the corporate registry of ASIC, which holds critical information on more than two million companies in Australia. It holds the names of directors, companies, company names and corporate histories. It is a key resource for journalists and members of the public who wish to find out more about Australian companies. Business owners, for example, are required to lodge a lot of detail with ASIC, not all of which is made public, which undoubtedly they would not want to fall into the wrong hands.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">In the midst of the election last year we heard that the Turnbull government intended to award the contract for managing sensitive medical records to Telstra, which will be in charge of the new national cancer screening registry from next year. The contract, estimated to be worth $180 million over three years, will be the first time such sensitive data is in corporate hands. Telstra does not have an entirely spotless history in terms of taking care of its customers' data and has had a number of breaches considered by the Office of the Australian Information Commissioner. In 2014, Telstra was fined for exposing the personal data of nearly 16,000 customers online. <span style="font-style:italic;">The Australian</span>, in March 2014, stated: </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">The finding is the latest stain on Telstra's lax privacy record. In 2012 the telco received a similar warning from the Privacy Commissioner for publishing the personal information of more than 730,000 customers online. It also received warnings for breaches of customer data in 2010 when a mailing list error resulted in about 220,000 letters with incorrect addresses being mailed out.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">In an era such as this, when personal health data is being handed over to a large corporate entity which has, demonstrably, a patchy privacy record, the passage of this bill is more important than ever.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Then we have the proposed privatisation of the Medicare data system, which the government pledges is no longer going ahead. But one wonders whether it will keep to that promise. If it did go ahead it would be possibly the largest transfer of personal health and financial data from public to private hands ever undertaken by an Australian government. It is vitally important that the protections contained in this bill are in place before that happens, if it does.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The passage of this bill also matters because of the singular botching of another bill to do with the protection of privacy and data that is yet to be debated in this place, the Privacy Amendment Data (Re-identification Offence) Bill 2016. Labor proposes to vote against that bill because it is a bad law which does not seek to protect Australians from having their personal privacy compromised; rather, it aims to cover up embarrassing mistakes by government agencies. It was hastily drafted, and regrettably—again—this government has refused to negotiate in order to find a compromise position. Luckily, given the excessively long lead time, that has not occurred with the bill we are currently debating.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The delay of this bill concerning data breach notifications is, one could surmise, symptomatic of a broader problem with this Attorney-General. There are a whole range of essential tasks—filling vacant judge positions, visiting community legal centres and complying with the FOI Act—which he seems not to be engaged in, but he is very intent on pursuing ideological frolics like the destruction of section 18C of the RDA. As I said, it really is inexplicable that this minister and this government have taken some four years to bring forward a bill that has bipartisan support and that Australians and privacy advocates have been seeking for some time.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Concerns about privacy in the digital era will surely grow in coming years, and it is important that Australians have faith that the government and the parliament are responding in an appropriate way. Considering the comprehensive mess this government made of the 2016 census and associated concerns with the safety of data provided to the government, there is a risk that Australians are losing faith in this government's ability to handle their sensitive data. If Australians are to hand over their most sensitive personal information, they must have faith that it will be properly and responsibly handled. If Australians lose that faith then our ability as a government—whoever is in government—to collect the important data which is needed to run good policy is at risk. So passing this law is an important step that will demonstrate to Australians that the parliament recognises their legitimate concerns about the safety of their data and will compel those organisations who handle it to be more mindful. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">As I said, we regret that the government has taken so long to act in relation to this legislation but we are glad that it finally has. I commend the bill to the Senate.</span>

                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">
                    <a href="I07" type="MemberSpeech">
                      <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Senator LUDLAM</span>
                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Western Australia</span>—<span class="HPS-MinisterialTitles">Co-Deputy Leader of the Australian Greens</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">11:19</span>):  It will not come as a surprise to any in here that the Australian Greens also support the Privacy Amendment (Notifiable Data Breaches) Bill 2016. I think Senator Wong has given a good wrap-up of why the bill has such widespread support in this parliament. The basic principle is so sound that it will probably come as a shock to people to realise that these protections are not already enshrined in law in Australia—the fact that if you hold private information on people and you lose it you should be obliged to let people know so that they can do something about it. That is the principle that is at stake here. At the moment—and I will go through a couple of examples in a second—if the control of information that we hand over to government agencies, private companies and other entities, which records our lives in extraordinary detail, is lost, these entities are under no obligation whatsoever to report it so that we can take remedial action. That information could be credit card records, it could be your medical history, it could be your political views and affiliations, it could be your credit worthiness—anything at all. There have been some extraordinary examples, which I will go through.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I also find it immensely curious that the Australian government has not seen fit in more than three years—in fact, I think it is four years now—to proceed with this measure when the committee that it dominates, the Parliamentary Joint Committee on Intelligence and Security, in the wake of the disastrous debate on mandatory data retention, said that this is something that should happen. Senator Brandis at the time agreed with that, and nothing has been done.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">In terms of what is at stake here, this is not a trivial matter. There are trivial examples, if you want to find them. The Australian immigration department, a couple of years ago, accidentally published personal details of world leaders by mistake—so this stuff can affect anybody at all. Much more seriously, they accidentally disclosed thousands of records of people imprisoned in our immigration detention system. These are people who have fled violent and, in many cases, authoritarian regimes and who have then had their private personal details published by the department that is charged with protecting their interests. This can affect anybody at all.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">To go through some of the history briefly, in 2008 the Australian Law Reform Commission published a report, which was the first time, as far as I am aware—certainly the first time in my experience in this place—that that organisation had proposed a mandatory data breach notification scheme. As Senator Wong identified, in 2013 there was a bill that was up for debate—it was on the <span style="font-style:italic;">Notice Paper</span> in this place—that lapsed after the election. Senator Singh, I believe it was, introduced a private senators bill to the same effect the following year, and of course during 2013 and 2014 we had the debate in here on mandatory data retention.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The general principle, I would have thought, of reducing the risk of these kinds of disclosures in the first place is, firstly, do not collect more information than you need. That is one of the Australian privacy principles enshrined in legislation: do not collect anything more than you need. Secondly, make sure it is securely protected and encrypted and, thirdly, if you do lose control of it, notify the people whose interests may have been harmed. Those are the three key principles: do not collect it, protect what you do collect and let people know if you have some kind of failure.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">In the data retention debate, the government was obviously running directly in opposition to the first and, I would argue, most important principle, forcing telecommunications providers to collect vastly more information than they needed for their business records or the integrity of their networks. They were doing it for what we were originally told was only going to be the most serious national security and terrorism offences, but obviously the way the debate has swung now means we may see this material deployed in civil cases, family law disputes, copyright disputes—that kind of stuff. So this enormous pool of data that is basically worthless to everybody—certainly the telecommunications providers did not want to have to collect it—is being collected. So you have violated the first privacy principle. What happens when agencies or corporations lose control of this material that is being collected?</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">In 2008 the Law Reform Commission said people should be protected from this kind of disclosure. In 2013 the government introduced a bill. In 2014 a private senators bill was introduced. In 2014 the Parliamentary Joint Committee on Intelligence and Security said it was about time this was done, particularly if we were going ahead with data retention, and nothing happened. Nothing was done.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Let's just trip down memory lane. iTnews put together the biggest Australian data breaches of 2015. On 1 October, Kmart revealed it had discovered customers' data had been stolen by external attackers. David Jones disclosed that attackers had exploited a vulnerability in their WebSphere based website to pinch the sensitive personal details of their customers. Aussie Farmers Direct, a little bit later in October, found that it had fallen victim to an attack, according to iTnews, in which the personal details of more than 5,000 of its customers were posted online. In Aussietravelcover's breach, one of the first of 2015, 870,000 records were posted online by a teenage hacker. In one of the more notorious ones, 37 million customer profiles were ripped and posted from the infidelity website Ashley Madison. The US Office of Personnel Management fell for this. Hacking Team is one of the funnier examples, I guess. This is a company that provides offensive IT to governments undertaking dodgy activities. It found itself on the other side of the line when hackers pulled its pants down and disclosed all kinds of information about what Hacking Team was up to. VTech, TalkTalk, Experian—the list is enormous.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Those come just from 2015, and all of those examples happened since this parliament was made broadly aware, and the government has certainly known, that there is cross-party support—government, opposition and crossbench—for precisely the legislation that we are dealing with today. On 2 February last year I actually put a question to the minister, asking, 'Where is it?' A year later, we get around to it. It is really extraordinary.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The issues that I am going to invite the minister to respond to, if he cares to do so in his closing speech or if and when we go into committee, are issues that were raised during the inquiry into the exposure draft that the minister put forward in 2016. The main issues that we are concerned about relate to who the bill applies to. For example, the Privacy Act, which this bill amends, does not apply to small businesses operating on a turnover of less than $3 million. We think that is highly problematic. The threshold determining who this bill applies to should not have anything to do with turnover. It should have regard to how much material those entities are holding. Really, their turnover is irrelevant. There are companies and entities such as researchers operating under much smaller turnovers than that who are still amassing large amounts of private information. So that is one issue that I hope the minister will address.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">So is the fact that enforcement agencies will be able to give themselves a free pass. Enforcement agencies such as the police or investigatory agencies can decide themselves, if they suffer a data breach, whether or not to disclose it. We think at the very minimum there should be some kind of reporting obligation so that we know if that is occurring. Some of the submitters to the inquiry suggested that the Ombudsman should play a role.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The third exemption from the Privacy Act, which should affect us all and give us cause to have a serious think, is political parties. They are collecting large amounts of private information on people in the electorate. Even after this bill is passed, they will still have no obligation to disclose any data breaches. We think that that is wrong.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The second issue is the test of seriousness. If you are a company or a government department who realises that a breach has occurred and you are trying to decide whether or not you fall within the ambit of this bill, you will need to pass the 'serious harm' test. This is an issue Senator Wong addressed briefly, but it was an issue that was hashed out by those who made submissions to the inquiry into the bill. We support the view of the Australian Privacy Foundation, who made a very detailed submission on the bill, that the threshold for requiring notification should be based on either of the following conditions being satisfied: a real risk of harm—without qualifying it according to the seriousness of the risk—or a significant breach, whether or not a real risk of harm has arisen.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">That will lead us to the third issue that we believe has not been addressed yet: the fact that, if we simplify the test such that the entity does not have to assess whether or not there is a serious risk of harm but whether it is a significant breach or whether there is a real risk of harm, it should not take 30 days to undertake the test. I will read briefly from what is buried in the government's own explanatory memorandum, at clause 80. It says:</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">Under the voluntary system—</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">in other words, the system that we have at the moment—</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">the notification of individuals can be delayed for years, as discussed above. Such a failure to notify an affected individual of a data breach in a timely manner increases the potential cost of the data breach on the individual. For example, a delay in notification increases the risk of an affected individual becoming a victim of an identity crime such as identity theft, as they may be unaware of the need to take action to mitigate the detrimental consequences of the data breach. Summary statistics for the last 12 months presented in IDCARE's submission to the 2015-16 consultation indicated that the average number of days between a data breach and an individual being notified of the breach was 405 days, whereas the average time between a data breach and the misuse of compromised information was 72 hours.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">So we have a voluntary system where there is no time threshold at all; people can choose to tell you or not, and it is really up to the company or the department. The average number of days between a breach and an individual being notified was 405 days. The bill, as we read it, would reduce that to a mandatory 30 days. The explanatory memorandum says the average time between a data breach and a misuse of compromised information is 72 hours. My question to the government is: what possible justification do you have for leaving people hanging out for that additional 27 days? Twenty-seven days—or 30 days, as the government has it in the bill at the moment—is an extraordinarily long period of time for material to be abused. If somebody loses control of my credit card information, I do not want legislation that does not force them to disclose that to me for a month, because a lot of harm can be done in a month.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">These are the issues that we would like government to address before we put this bill to a vote. Other than that, I look forward to the bill passing into law—it is an essential piece of privacy legislation. As no doubt other speakers will point out, it is long overdue. In fact, we think it has been weakened in some important ways from the original conception proposed by the Australian Law Reform Commission all the way back in 2008. It is time that this bill was put to a vote, but we hope that the Senate will give regard to some of the issues that we have raised on the way through. I now move the second reading amendment standing in my name:</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">
                    <span style="font-style:italic;" />At the end of the motion, add "but calls on the Government to extend the <span style="font-style:italic;">Privacy Act 1988 </span>to include political parties and businesses with an annual turnover under $3m, as such organisations have considerable holdings".</span>

                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Tasmania</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">11:32</span>):  The bill before the Senate today—the Privacy Amendment (Notifiable Data Breaches) Bill—amends the Privacy Act to introduce mandatory data breach notification provisions for agencies, organisations and certain other entities that are regulated by the act. The bill requires agencies and organisations regulated by the Privacy Act to provide notice to the Australian Information Commissioner and affected individuals of an 'eligible data breach'. An eligible data breach is one where a reasonable person would conclude that there is a likely risk of serious harm to any of the affected individuals as a result of the unauthorised access or unauthorised disclosure. Failure to comply with an obligation included in the bill will be deemed to be an interference with the privacy of an individual for the purposes of the Privacy Act. This will engage the commissioner's existing powers to investigate, make determinations and provide remedies in relation to non-compliance with the Privacy Act. Entities that are already exempt from the requirements of the Privacy Act, such as intelligence agencies and small businesses, will not be subject to the requirements of this bill, and law enforcement agencies will not be required to notify affected individuals if it is likely to prejudice law enforcement activities.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This bill was introduced to the parliament in October last year—that is more than three years since Labor, in government, introduced a bill to provide for a mandatory data breach notification scheme. That is three years of those opposite dragging their feet while thousands of Australians have been victims of data breaches. In those three years, Labor has consistently called on those opposite to establish a mandatory data breach notification scheme. The introduction of Labor's bill—the Privacy Amendment (Privacy Alerts) Bill—followed lengthy consultation with industry. It was endorsed by a Senate committee and passed the House of Representatives with the support of those opposite, but lapsed with the dissolution of parliament for the 2013 election. In 2014, in opposition, we introduced a private senator's bill which was almost identical to our government bill. In 2015, we made the introduction of the notification scheme a condition of our support for the government's data retention laws. The government undertook to have the scheme introduced by the end of that year. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The bipartisan Parliamentary Joint Committee on Intelligence and Security had recommended in 2013 that, if the government was to pursue any data retention regime, the legislation should include a mandatory data breach notification scheme. In fact, Senator Brandis—the minister now responsible for carriage of this legislation—was a member of the committee at the time. In 2015, the same committee insisted that the government implement mandatory data breach notification legislation by the end of that year. Having missed that deadline, the measure was then thwarted by Mr Turnbull's political stunt of proroguing parliament and calling an early double-dissolution election. After years of dragging their feet, this government has finally caught up with Labor on this issue. All I can say about that is: it is about time.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This is not a particularly controversial measure, so why has it taken this government so long to follow Labor's lead? All they had to do was pick up the legislation that we put to parliament in 2013 or the private senator's bill that we put to Parliament in 2014. In fact, Labor's 2014 privacy alerts bill was still before the parliament when Mr Turnbull pulled his double-dissolution stunt two years later. In government, Labor had already done the hard yards by consulting with industry, drafting the bill and securing bipartisan support. All the Abbott-Turnbull government had to do was pick up the bill and run with it. Had they done so years earlier, the outcome could have been much better for the thousands of Australians who have been the victims of data breaches. Those opposite have dragged their feet on this issue. There have been a number of major data breaches over the past three years—some involving literally hundreds of thousands of sensitive customer records. Without a mandatory notification scheme, we do not know how many other breaches have gone unreported, how many thousands or even millions of customer records are involved, or what information has been compromised. Had the government introduced the bill earlier, I am in no doubt that many more Australians would have been promptly notified of data breaches involving their personal information.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">McAfee Labs' threat report for August 2015 states that there has been a 'monumental increase in the number of major data breaches and in the volume of records stolen' between 2010 and 2015. I will outline a few of the many examples of large-scale data breaches that have gone public, including some that occurred in the three years that this government has been procrastinating on this bill. But I stress that these are just the breaches that we know of.</span>

                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">In 2013, Telstra had to issue a formal apology to customers after phone numbers, names and home addresses were found online during a Google search. While Telstra said that the privacy breach was not acceptable, they had already been investigated by the Privacy Commissioner for two data breaches in the three years prior. One of those breaches, in 2011, resulted in the details of almost 800,000 customers being left online for eight months.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">In October 2015, Kmart revealed that it was urgently working to address a privacy breach in which customer data had been stolen during a cyber attack. The customer details taken during the attack included names, email addresses, delivery and billing addresses, phone numbers and product purchase details. Fortunately, no credit card or other payment details had been compromised, as the company used an external gateway for payments and did not store the details internally. A similar breach was reported by retailer David Jones the following day, with the stolen data including names, email and mailing addresses, and order details but no financial information or passwords. Later that year, in November, hackers stole data lodged through online inquiry forms from the Queensland TAFE and Department of Education websites, although the Queensland government said that they were confident the data were not very sensitive and that no financial information had been obtained. </span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">In October last year, the records of 550,000 Australians donating blood to the Red Cross Blood Service were published online. The file included personal details such as the donor's name, gender, residential and email address, phone number, date of birth, country of birth and blood type. It also included sensitive medical information, like whether someone had engaged in at-risk sexual behaviour in the last year.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Australians have also been caught up in larger data breaches involving multinational corporations. In 2011, personal information of 77 million subscribers to the Sony PlayStation network was stolen, including names, addresses, email addresses, birthdates, usernames, passwords, logins and security questions. Sony revealed that the hack may have even resulted in the theft of credit card information. Following the hack, Sony could not guarantee that credit card data was not involved in the breach, but their Australian division was warning Australian customers to check their credit card accounts for suspicious activity.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">There are many more examples I could go through. In fact, in the 2015-16 financial year alone, the Breach Level Index report provides 22 reports of data breaches in Australia involving over four million records. It is no wonder the Abbott-Turnbull government has taken so long to introduce a mandatory data breach notification scheme, when they themselves cannot practice what they preach.</span>

                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">In September last year, a group of academics from the University of Melbourne notified the government that it was possible to figure out provider ID numbers from Medicare Benefits Schedule and Pharmaceutical Benefits Schedule datasets published on the Department of Health's website. While the government was notified of the issue on 12 September, it took them until the 29th—that is, 17 days later—to admit to the breach. While we welcome the privacy and information commissioner's decision to investigate the breach, it should be remembered that this is the very same commissioner whose position those opposite had been attempting to abolish for two years. Since the data—now removed from the department's website—was published, it has been downloaded 1,500 times. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Only a month after this breach, you may recall that we were debating legislation to outsource the management of sensitive health data on the National Cancer Screening Register to Telstra. As I explained during the debate on that bill, the data to be handed over to Telstra included sensitive data such as Medicare numbers, Medicare claims information and cancer-screening test results. I also mentioned during that debate that Telstra themselves have a poor track record when it comes to the security of customers' information. For example, you only have to look the two massive data breaches Telstra have had in recent history, which I referred to earlier in this speech and in the speech on the cancer screening bill. Despite industry concerns about the arrangement, the bill passed the parliament, giving effect to the $220 million contract which was secretively awarded to Telstra before the last election.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Another serious data breach involved the personal details of world leaders at the 2014 Brisbane G20 Summit being emailed to an external recipient in early 2015. This breach involved the passport numbers of major world leaders such as US President at the time, Barack Obama, and Chinese President Xi Jinping, yet in an embarrassment for the Australian government these world leaders were not immediately notified of the breach. This was a bad record for the department of immigration, which had inadvertently published the personal information of 10,000 asylum seekers in February 2014. This information was made available for 14 days and accessed 123 times. Many of the asylum seekers affected said that the breach had made returning to their home countries even more perilous. The then immigration minister, Mr Morrison, launched an investigation into how the data breach threatened the safety of the asylum seekers if they had returned home. Sadly, however, a court found that the investigation withheld information from asylum seekers critical to arguing their case, ensuring their claims failed. They were not told what the breach entailed or who might have accessed the information, and they were denied a copy of the KPMG report into the breach. So much for open government. The guidelines set down by the Office of the Australian Information Commissioner state:</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">In general, if a data breach creates a real risk of serious harm to the individual, the affected individuals … should be notified.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Yet the examples I have just given demonstrate a consistent failure by this government to follow this very reasonable guideline. So, not only does the government have a poor track record when it comes to the pace of this important reform; they also have a poor track record when it comes to following the very principles that they seek to impose on others through this bill. If those opposite truly believed in mandatory data breach notification for the private sector then not only should they have acted more quickly on this reform but also they should have set a better example themselves.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The standard they have set when it comes to data breach notification is very, very poor indeed. When I was chair of the parliament's Joint Select Committee on Cyber-Safety we conducted an inquiry into cybersafety for senior Australians. The report of that inquiry, released in March 2013, made some observations about the issue of mandatory reporting of data breaches. One submission to the inquiry cited 2008 research by the Australian Institute of Criminology that found that only eight per cent of small to medium enterprises reported data breaches, despite security incidents costing those businesses an estimated $600 million. Other research indicated that 73 per cent of small to medium enterprises had experienced at least one data breach in 2010. We also noted in our report research from the Australian Information Security Association that found that security of information is a low budget priority in most industries. The AISA also said:</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-SmallBullet" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-SmallBullet">Any data breach notification scheme should be part of a broader and "more responsive" regulatory approach supporting information security.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">It was noted in the report that the Labor government at that time was working on a scheme for mandatory notification of data breaches. This was the work that led to our 2013 bill.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This bill is based on a very sound principle: that a person has a right to know if the security of their personal information has been compromised, whether it is held by a retailer, a financial institution, a telecommunications provider or any other business. Right now, if any Australian has their personal information compromised either accidentally or through hacking, the company that holds the data is under no obligation to inform the victim that that has occurred. There are, thankfully, many companies who make it their policy to do the right thing and notify customers immediately when their personal data has been breached, but it is not compulsory. When customers have their personal information, such as their name, address, date of birth, passwords and even their banking and credit card details, disclosed or accessed without their authorisation there is no legal obligation for them to know that it has happened.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">There are a number of advantages to mandatory notification of data breaches. Mandatory notification allows affected customers to take steps to protect their information. For example, if the breach includes financial information, customers can change bank accounts or cancel their credit cards. If it includes passwords, they can change their passwords. Unfortunately customers cannot readily change other pieces of information, such as their address or date of birth, but at least knowing the information is out there can prepare them and give them the opportunity to discuss their concerns with any institutions that might use that information for identity checking or security. Of course we know about the issues around identity theft, so we need to always bear that in mind.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Mandatory notification also provides companies holding personal information with an incentive to strengthen their data protection measures and to make sure that the breach does not happen in the first place. If a company is compelled by law to notify its customers of a data breach then the risk of reputational damage to the company might make the investment in stronger data security more attractive.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">It stands to reason that Labor will support this bill because we have been calling on the government to introduce mandatory data breach notification for over three years. It has been three years in which we have had an Attorney-General who is not interested in protecting the privacy of Australians because he has been a bit distracted. He has been distracted by defending the so-called rights of bigots and those who seek to engage in hate speech, he has been distracted by his ideological attacks on Australia's arts industry and he has been distracted by his public spats with the Australian Human Rights Commissioner and the Solicitor-General. So it is no wonder, with the storm of controversy that this minister creates for himself, that he is too busy to get on with the job of protecting Australians' right to privacy. He is too busy to ensure the timely introduction of this important and well-overdue reform. But, after three years of inaction, we do finally have a bill before the Senate and, as overdue as this bill may be, I guess it is a case of better late than never.</span>

                      <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Senator GRIFF</span>
                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">South Australia</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">11:49</span>):  I am very pleased to see the government has kept its promise to introduce the Privacy Amendment (Notifiable Data Breaches) Bill 2016 which will enforce mandatory data breach notifications for organisations that inadvertently lose or release sensitive consumer data. Senators will recall that during last year's debate on the national cancer-screening register bills we moved an amendment and sought a commitment from the government to strengthen privacy laws as recommended by the Australian Law Reform Commission some eight years ago. Since that time there have been three different data breach models proposed.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This bill currently before us is an important piece of legislation because, in contrast to previous incarnations and the existing voluntary notification scheme, it finally obliges organisations to report potentially harmful data breaches, which is very much an area where Australian privacy laws have fallen well behind. It will ensure the public are notified should there be a breach of personal information, such as that contained in the cancer-screening records managed by Telstra or indeed any other entities subject to and regulated by the Privacy Act.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">As we have recently seen with the inadvertent release of passwords and other personal information at organisations as diverse as Yahoo!, the Red Cross Blood Service and Telstra itself in 2011 and again in 2012 and 2013, we cannot assume that electronic data will always be kept safe. As more and more of our personal data is stored online, we also become more susceptible to the risks of identity theft. Whether it is through phishing, hacking, remote access scams, malware and ransomware or document theft, identity theft has become an extremely sophisticated and lucrative business worth upwards of a staggering $1.6 billion per year in Australia alone.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">According to the Australian Federal Police, identity crime is also a key enabler of serious and organised crime, costing Australia around $15 billion annually. According to cyber experts, the 2016 Red Cross Blood Service data breach—which, by the way, was Australia's largest security breach—was a perfect example of how the personal data of some 550,000 Australians could potentially have been used for identity theft if it had fallen into the wrong hands and been sold on the underground black market. The data disclosed included personal details and identifying information, including names, gender, addresses and dates of birth—all material that could be easily used to falsify a person's identity to access bank accounts and to obtain loans, credit cards, phone contracts and even government benefits. Luckily, this data breach was well managed by the Red Cross and these potential risks were mitigated.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The proliferation of online personal data storage by public and private entities alike has made it absolutely necessary to ensure that, whenever unauthorised events happen, affected members of the public are informed in a timely manner so that they are aware that their private data has been compromised and are in a position to act as soon as possible and hopefully before any damage is done. It will very much be a comfort for the public to know that the corporations and agencies that are entrusted with their personal data must from now on act with more accountability and transparency in the event of a privacy breach. With these few words, the Nick Xenophon Team supports this bill.</span>

                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">
                    <a href="M0R" type="MemberSpeech">
                      <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Senator SINGH</span>
                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Tasmania</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">11:53</span>):  I rise to speak on the Privacy Amendment (Notifiable Data Breaches) Bill 2016 with a sense of relief but also with a sense of deja vu. As the Senate would recall, I introduced a private senator's bill of the very same intent in 2014—the Privacy Amendment (Privacy Alerts) Bill 2014, a bill that was thwarted by this government. So, I would like to take a step back and actually highlight the history of this important issue—and it is an incredibly important issue.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">After extensive consultation, Labor introduced legislation in government in 2013 to implement mandatory data breach alerts. This bill was passed on 6 June 2013 by the House of Representatives with bipartisan support. It was introduced into the Senate and was referred on 18 June 2013 to the Legal and Constitutional Affairs Legislation Committee for inquiry. The committee reported on 24 June 2013, its sole recommendation being that the Senate pass this bill. The bill then lapsed, on prorogation of the 43rd parliament, so I reintroduced an almost identical bill—the privacy alerts bill—as a private senator's bill in 2014, a bill to make it compulsory for corporations and governments to notify people if their privacy is breached and personal details are released without authorisation.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">At the time, the coalition senators in this place filibustered extensively to ensure that this piece of legislation did not pass. Despite their record of bipartisan support, time and time again they came into this chamber and filibustered on this important legislation—this legislation that today we similarly have in this place. So it is now clear that it was not the piece of legislation that was the issue; it was that Labor had introduced it—clear, plain politics, on such an important issue as people's privacy and the breach of their privacy.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Labor has always been committed to mandatory data breach notification provisions and of course therefore supports that the government is finally enacting these protections. Unlike the coalition senators, we will not play politics with people's lives or with their privacy and the breach thereof. Labor believes that Australians should be told when there has been a breach of their privacy. And at this very moment in time, and since 2013, when Labor first introduced this legislation, there is nothing in place to notify someone if there data has been breached, if their privacy has been breached, in that sense. So it is very much time that companies, corporations and government agencies who are required to protect Australians' personal data should also have the complementary duty to tell a customer when their personal data has been the subject of unauthorised public release.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Businesses that already implement good privacy practices and comply with the current voluntary guide from the Office of the Australian Information Commissioner will have little difficulty in transitioning to this new scheme, because they are already showing an obligation towards their customers. But the risk of data breaches and the seriousness of their consequences has grown as new technology has allowed government and the private sector to collect more and more personal information about Australians. A consumer should have the right to know if their personal information has been compromised or if their bank or their telecommunications provider has lax security standards. Consumers need to have the power to change their passwords, improve their security settings online, cancel their credit cards or completely change providers such as banks or telecommunications companies if they need to do so. But how can they do any of that when, at the moment, they do not even know that their data has been released?</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">That is what this legislation is all about. That is what makes this legislation so important, and that is why Labor introduced it in 2013 and I similarly introduced it in 2014. Yet it did not pass this place, because of those coalition senators filibustering and not having it pass because they did not want Labor to have that win of being the side that introduced it, and that is shameful.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">So, let's look at some of the breaches in recent years—and there have been a number, because, as I said, we are living more and more in a digital world, and more and more data and personal information is being collected about Australian families. This bill puts in place some kind of compulsory notification regime in order to strengthen those protections around that information and build on the privacy regime that I talked about that Labor implemented when in government. Some of those highly publicised data breaches have included sensitive and very personal details of customers, such as the 15,775 Telstra customers who were affected by a breach that made their names, telephone numbers and home and business addresses accessible through a global Google search. That was only one example of several Telstra privacy breaches, in fact.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">There was, of course, that shocking case of one billion Yahoo customers who were affected by hacks—again, private information including names, email addresses, telephone numbers, dates of birth and some passwords were accessed—and it took two years for news of that breach to be made public. It took two years before those one billion customers had any understanding that their data had been breached. Aussie Travel Cover, one of Australia's largest insurance companies, had its computer system hacked, and around 750,000 records of personal details were stolen, which included names, phone numbers, email addresses, travel dates and the cost of their policies. Addresses and partial credit card details were stolen, and that company opted not to tell customers about the hacking—it left them completely in the dark. This is why this legislation is so important; and this is why Labor has been pushing it for so many years.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The hacking of Catch of the Day, in which personal information credit card numbers were stolen, took three years to be made public—three years in which customers were unaware that their personal details were not secure. Catch of the Day has not released the number of consumers that were affected by this breach, but Australian consumers reported fraudulent activity on their cards shortly after the breach. So go figure—the poor old consumer had to figure it out for themselves.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">These breaches have also affected the government sector. In 2014 the personal details of almost 10,000 asylum seekers were accidentally published on the Department of Immigration and Border Protection's website. The details included full names, gender, citizenship, date of birth, period of immigration detention, location, boat arrival details and reasons for the individual being deemed unlawful. Absolutely appalling! </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">McAfee Labs Threats Report for August 2015, which reviewed changes in cyber threats and cybersecurity from 2010 to 2015, states that there has been a 'monumental increase in the number of major data breaches and in the volume of records stolen'. There could not be clearer evidence of why this legislation is so important to get through this place. Yet it is now 2017, some four years on since Labor first introduced our bill of similar intent, and finally the government is going to act on it. It should not have taken so long. In fact, if it had not taken so long, a number of data breaches could have been managed much better than they were—they simply left consumers in the dark.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Data breaches are not a concern only for individuals, although first and foremost the individual is of utmost concern. The security of personal data is of commercial importance to Australian companies. Data breaches are simply bad for business and can be incredibly costly. Companies stand to lose not just time and money rectifying a data breach, but also their reputation. In the modern information economy the trust of consumers in a company's privacy compliance is an incredibly important part of a company's goodwill. What happened when Telstra had that massive data breach of thousands and thousands people's information is clearly in people's minds; what happened to those one billion Yahoo customers is clearly in people's minds. Did they want to stay with Yahoo after that?</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">When Kmart and David Jones experienced data breaches, both companies notified affected customers. That is good corporate policy; it shows a company's goodwill towards its consumers. That is the sort of positive step that some companies adopt; it stands in contrast to those corporations I highlighted earlier that hide the breaches. A mandatory data breach notification scheme is the most basic of privacy protections, allowing consumers to take action such as cancelling credit cards when their data has been hacked. It is that simple, and yet it has taken so long for this parliament to act on it, due to those coalition senators. While it is customary for many banks, government departments, retailers and telecommunications providers to notify customers of breaches, it is not compulsory. They do not have to do it. In practice this means that victims of serious breaches are not aware that their data has been corrupted.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The bill before us today amends the Privacy Act 1988 to introduce mandatory data breach notification provisions for agencies, organisations and certain other entities that are regulated by the Privacy Act. The bill is so important because it requires those agencies and organisations regulated by the Privacy Act to provide notice first and foremost to the Australian Information Commissioner and then affected individuals of an eligible data breach. At the moment that requirement does not exist. I have highlighted some examples of companies which inform their customers and others which have hidden breaches.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">A data breach arises where there has been unauthorised access to, or unauthorised disclosure of, personal information about one or more individuals or where such information is lost in circumstances that are likely to give rise to unauthorised access or unauthorised disclosure. The bill will introduce a new consumer privacy protection for Australians that will keep their personal information more secure in the digital age. It will also encourage agencies and private sector organisations to improve their data security practices. It is an important general step that they should be taking any way. If an entity suspects that an eligible data breach has occurred, it must undertake an assessment into the relevant circumstances and, in the event of an actual data breach, an entity is required to notify the Information Commissioner and affected individuals as soon as practicable after the entity becomes aware that there are reasonable grounds to believe that there has been an eligible data breach. To give rise to an eligible data breach, the reasonable person would need to be satisfied that the risk of serious harm occurring is likely—that is, more probable than not. In deciding whether this is the case, entities are required to have regard to a list of relevant matters, which, I understand, are included in this bill. Failure to comply with an obligation included in the bill will be deemed to be an interference with the privacy of an individual for the purposes of the Privacy Act and that will engage the commissioner's existing powers to investigate, make determinations and provide remedies in relation to non-compliance with the Privacy Act.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">So despite the delay tactics of the coalition, this important issue has remained on the agenda. There has been a number of reports about it. I know that the <span style="font-style:italic;">Australian Financial Review</span> has reported a number of times about this issue and also the Parliamentary Joint Committee on Intelligence and Security recommended in its report on the mandatory data legislation in 2015 that if the legislation went forward, it was vital that data breach notification legislation be introduced as well.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The coalition government, I understand, was committed to introducing mandatory data breach notification provisions by the end of 2015. It is now 2017. It has taken the government more than three years to bring itself to introduce this legislation that it voted in favour of back when Labor was in government in 2013. If the government had introduced that legislation three years ago, thousands of customers would have been promptly notified that their data was breached. If they had put aside their partisan antics, we could have had privacy alerts legislation when I introduced the bill in this place in 2014. I am pleased to see the government has finally caught up with Labor's proposed legislation—the mandatory notification of consumers when their data has been breached. I am very relieved indeed that the government is finally getting on with honouring its commitment but the impact its delay tactics have had on the people of Australia should not be underestimated. That is why Labor supports this bill but notes very clearly that it is long overdue.</span>

                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">

                      <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Senator BERNARDI</span>
                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">South Australia</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">12:10</span>):  It is interesting to listen to Senator Singh. I understand her frustration in respect to one side of politics or the other not supporting an initiative by someone else and then supporting when it is from their own team. I had the same experience with the Labor Party in trying to stop child sex tourism when they were government and it took over 15 months for the then Labor government to see the wisdom of that initiative to adopt the legislation that I put forward as their own and finally bring it into this place. Senator Singh, your frustration—through you, Mr Acting Deputy President—is absolutely shared.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I will not delay the Senate more than is necessary but there are a few concerns that I have on behalf of Australian Conservatives that perhaps in the summing up speech or if there is a committee stage the minister might consider addressing. The first of these is the fact that this bill contains provision that the notifications need to go to the Information Commissioner. It is not lost on me and I am sure it is not lost on many in this place where we note that this is the very office that the attorney sought to abolish and was prevented doing so by the Senate crossbench in a previous iteration. There are concerns and reports that have been handed to me that the Information Commissioner is operating with scarce or scant or non-existent—depending on who you listen to—resources. Some have suggested he is actually working from home. So the question I ask is whether the Information Commissioner will be in a position to fully respond to the other onerous requirements which are attached to this bill. I look forward to a response in due time from the minister or from the Attorney-General.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The second concern Australian Conservatives have is about the definition of 'serious harm'. Harm, however you are going to define it, is defined as including serious physical, psychological, emotional, economic, financial or reputational harm. This bill does not strictly define that at all. In fact, it is very subjective. I have been on the record about subjective tests in other legislation that have been enacted in other bills. In this time of extreme political correctness, we have safe spaces and trigger warnings for all sorts of concerns. Do we have the same sorts of implications in this bill? If you are not prepared to define 'serious harm' and if you are not prepared to define what is 'psychological harm', businesses can find themselves in all sorts of inadvertent direct accusations and inadvertent breaches of this bill or this act because what they thought was serious harm or was not serious harm was considered by an individual or another group as being serious harm. So where you are talking about psychological and emotional harm and other varieties of harm, I think the definition needs to be more succinct. Otherwise, we risk of course having the proverbial 'lawyers' picnic', where they will queue up to advise businesses large and small about what could be a serious breach. Of course those who err on the side of caution will say let's report every single breach to the Information Commissioner, who may or may not have the resources required to deal with what could be thousands, tens of thousands or maybe hundreds of thousands of complaints every year.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The other aspect—and I will conclude shortly—is which businesses are exactly captured by this. I recognise that there are some broad parameters in here. My concern is principally for small businesses, who are often ill equipped to deal with onerous regulations and compliances mandated by governments. I believe that small businesses should be able to get on with building their businesses and trying to generate wealth for them and their families, generate jobs and improve the economic conditions for all involved. Sometimes governments can put forward well-meaning initiatives that create an enormous amount of red tape and bureaucracy for small businesses in particular, who then are forced to employ people to comply with various aspects of it or, as I mentioned earlier, maybe get legal advice, which is expensive—sometimes prohibitively so—and end up running their business for the government rather than for the benefit of the country.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I would like to think that small businesses will not be captured here, but those that are captured are:</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">… those that provide a health service, are a credit reporting body, or trade in personal information.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Political parties trade in personal information. A not-for-profit with a turnover of over $3 million would include the Labor Party, the Liberal Party, the Greens and maybe some other political parties and organisations. Does that mean, if a fraction of their membership list gets leaked by one of their branch officers, they are going to have to notify the Office of the Australian Information Commissioner and have an investigation into how this took place and so forth? Is it going to apply to doctors' surgeries? Will it apply to direct-mailing houses? What is an information breach? Is it just someone's name or a list of names? Or does it have to include personal information such as dates of birth, perhaps, or email addresses? Does it include physical addresses or just a mailing address? These are the sorts of questions that I think people are entitled to ask and have concerns about. Anyone with a mailing list could potentially fall foul of this, depending on the definitions.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">As an Australian Conservative, I am concerned about the regulation and red tape. I am concerned about the lack of specificity in this bill, because it does leave it open to a number of subjective assessments and I do not think that it is a positive way to go. Nonetheless it is clear to me that this legislation is going to get through. I hope the Attorney-General and the minister will take on board some of these questions and maybe provide a response but also be aware in future legislation that maybe some amendments will need to be made. I thank the Senate.</span>

                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">
                    <a href="bv7" type="MemberSpeech">
                      <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Senator SINODINOS</span>
                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">New South Wales</span>—<span class="HPS-MinisterialTitles">Minister for Industry, Innovation and Science</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">12:17</span>):  I think I am at the summing-up stage now. I want to thank honourable senators for their contribution to the debate on the Privacy Amendment (Notifiable Data Breaches) Bill 2016. There has clearly been a lot of interest around the chamber, and a number of issues have been raised during the debate, some of which I have here in front of me. Let me start with amendment C: significant data breach. Section 26WE is already intended to cover incidents that would be considered significant data breaches. The government expects that guidance material from the Office of the Australian Information Commissioner will help ensure that entities subject to the bill understand the full range of incidents covered here under section 26WE as currently drafted.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">One of the other issues that has arisen is the scope of the scheme. Why are small businesses and other entities covered or not covered? The bill's mandatory data breach notification scheme applies only to entities which are already subject to the Privacy Act—that is, Australian government agencies, other than those exempt from the act such as: intelligence agencies; private sector organisations with annual turnover greater than $3 million; and specific kinds of small businesses such as health service providers, credit reporting bodies and credit providers, and tax file number recipients. The Privacy Act seeks to achieve an appropriate balance between ensuring that entities that hold personal information apply appropriate privacy standards and not imposing unnecessary regulation on small business.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The bill's mandatory data breach notification scheme is linked to the information security requirements which already apply to entities subject to the Privacy Act, in particular, existing Australian Privacy Principle 11, which requires entities to take reasonable steps to secure personal information they hold. Expanding the scheme to cover entities not currently covered by the Privacy Act would apply it to entities who do not have pre-existing information security obligations under the Privacy Act and could not be subject to other enforcement action by the commissioner under the act. It is also not considered desirable to alter existing Privacy Act exemptions which apply to entities such as intelligence agencies or media organisations acting in the course of journalism solely for the purpose of the mandatory data breach notification scheme.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Another issue that has been raised is why the bill does not provide specific assessment notification time frames. The proposed section 26WH applies where an entity has 'reasonable grounds to suspect that there may have been an eligible data breach of the entity'. Section 26WH requires entities to conduct 'a reasonable and expeditious assessment' of whether there are reasonable grounds to believe that there has been an eligible data breach of the entity. A 'reasonable' assessment is expected to be one that focuses on matters that can be reasonably justified as relevant to determining whether a data breach has occurred. 'Expeditious' in this context is not defined. It will depend on all the relevant circumstances, with the intent being that entities should move as promptly as possible in the circumstances to determine whether notification is required.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Section 26WH also includes the additional requirement that entities must 'take all reasonable steps to ensure that the assessment is completed within 30 days' of when the entity first suspected an eligible data breach may have occurred. This is not a hard 30-day deadline but instead reflects the policy intention that 30 days would generally be an appropriate amount of time in cases where there may be a likely risk of serious harm to individuals arising from an individual. Section 26WH recognises, however, that in some cases entities may need longer than 30 days to complete an assessment—for example, where the facts of a suspected eligible data breach are particularly complex, or where completing the assessment within 30 days would require an unreasonable application of resources. This responds to concerns that were raised frequently in the exposure draft consultation, from December 2015 to March 2016, about the potential complexity of assessing whether a breach has occurred. The 30-day requirement must also be read alongside the requirement in section 26WH to undertake an expeditious assessment. This means that in some cases an entity may be required to complete an assessment in less than 30 days—for example, where the circumstances are relatively straightforward.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">If when an entity first becomes aware of a data breach it is clear that there are reasonable grounds to believe that there has been an eligible data breach of the entity, then section 26WH will not apply and the entity will be required to move straight to the notification requirements in sections 26WK and 26WL. The proposed sections 26WK and 26WL provide that, where an entity has 'reasonable grounds to believe that there has been an eligible data breach of the entity' the entity must prepare a statement about the breach, provide a copy of the statement to the Australian Information Commissioner, and notify affected individuals of its contents, as soon as practicable. What constitutes a practicable time frame will vary, depending on the circumstances of the eligible data breach, and the entity that experienced the eligible data breach. This flexibility recognises that while in many cases prompt notification will be appropriate, in other cases entities may need additional time to comply with the notification requirement. Guidance materials from the Australian Information Commissioner is expected to provide practical assistance in determining appropriate time frames to notify an eligible data breach. The Information Commissioner could also investigate failure to notify an eligible data breach as soon as practicable or issue the entity with a direction to notify, under proposed section 26WR, if the commissioner became aware of an eligible data breach that the entity had not yet notified.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">A number of speakers, principally from the opposition, have raised an issue about the time taken to introduce the bill. The government has taken time to consider the design of the Mandatory Data Breach Notification Scheme contained in this bill and to undertake a proper and adequate consultation process with stakeholders. The time line is this: an exposure draft bill was released on 3 December, 2015, with submissions open until 4 March 2016. A total of 56 submissions were received, including 47 public submissions, which are available on the Attorney-General's Department's website. The bill was scheduled for introduction in the autumn 2016 sittings of parliament, but this did not occur before the election was called. The government introduced the bill in the spring 2016 sittings of parliament and has promptly brought the bill on for debate.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I believe Senator Ludlam has raised an issue about the enforcement bodies exception—section 26WN. The proposed section 26WN provides an exception from the requirement to notify individuals if an enforcement body, such as the Australian Federal Police, experiences a breach, where notification would compromise an enforcement related activity, such as an ongoing investigation. However, section 26WN does not excuse the enforcement body from notifying the Australian Information Commissioner. This should ensure appropriate oversight of data breaches of this kind.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The purpose of the scheme is to ensure that individuals can take steps to protect themselves in the event that their personal information is compromised in a data breach. As such, it implements the government's response to the Parliamentary Joint Committee on Intelligence and Security's February 2005 advisory report on the Telecommunications (Interception and Access) Amendment (Data Retention) Bill 2015. The bill will create a Mandatory Data Breach Notification Scheme that will apply to Australian government agencies and private sector organisations subject to the act. They would be required to notify an individual whose personal information is subject to unauthorised access, unauthorised disclosure or loss, where a reasonable person would consider the individual is at likely risk of serious harm as a result. The extensive consultation undertaken on this bill has ensured that it strikes an appropriate balance between effectively protecting individuals while remaining workable for business covered by the bill. The bill complements existing information and security requirements in the Privacy Act and will provide individuals with confidence that they will be notified in the event of a data breach that places them at likely risk of serious harm. In an environment where entities collect and use growing volumes of personal information in their business activities, and individuals enter into increasing numbers of online transactions, the bill is an important consumer protection measure that builds on the strong privacy protections already provided in existing privacy legislation. On that basis I commend the bill to the chamber.</span>

Firstly, regarding the issue that we just took the second reading vote on, can the minister explain, just in case senators are not aware, why political parties are exempt from the Privacy Act? The second reading amendment that we just voted on is, as a second reading amendment, basically guidance to the government. It does not oblige the government to do anything, but we believe that political parties and businesses that are carrying large amounts of personal information, whether they are operating above or below a really arbitrary $3 million turnover threshold, should be obliged to notify users if they lose control of their private information. Why are political parties exempt from the parent act that we are amending and, therefore, from the operation of this bill?</span>

Just to confirm then, according to your response if the Liberal Party or the Labor Party, the Greens, the Xenophon party—or anybody at all who is collecting information on the electorate, on their voters, supporters and people who are not supporters—are hacked, and if that information of fairly intimate details of people's political leanings gets into the public domain, are the parties in question still not obliged under any law of this country to disclose that to the people whose interests they might have harmed?</span>

I guess that is confirmation. So it is voluntary for everybody at the moment, and we are tightening the net for some entities but not for political parties.

What is with the $3 million?</span>

In terms of the expeditious handling of this legislation—I do not agree with anything that Senator Ludlam, I am sure, will be putting to the chamber—it just seems that we are in a position where we are likely to have a double handling of it, where the same questions might, indeed, be asked again of Senator Brandis.

In the writs attached to the explanatory memorandum, the government is boasting that the proposed scheme will only apply to around six per cent of Australian businesses. So 94 per cent of Australian businesses will not be caught by this bill. I do not understand why it should relate to turnover rather than the fact that some of these small businesses will hold considerable amounts of people's private information, and, yet, that will be exempt from the bill. Rather than just a blanket statement that it would be unwieldy for them, why not move, as the Australian Privacy Foundation and many others have pointed out, to have the threshold be related to harm to the user base rather than to turnover of the small business? I genuinely do not understand why the government has gone that way.</span>

It is better that that be an empirically verifiable basis.

However, that judgement will exist if you are a bank, if you are a government department, if you are a large company, if you are Coles or any of the other entities that I mentioned in my contribution earlier. You are already going to need to be exercising judgement, as is explained in the EM and in the bill, around whether you have caused your user base, or people you have been collecting information on, serious harm. Why not extend that to anybody who is holding considerable amounts of information on their users? I would have thought that the purpose of the bill, which is going to be supported by everybody in here when we come to the final vote, is about protecting people. So we are imposing an obligation on one sector of the economy and on one big part of the public service but not on others not through any arbitrary distinction about whether they are holding information or not but around scale. I would have thought that scale, as the kind of metric that you are describing, is actually irrelevant under this circumstance.</span>

This bill, as I outlined in my speech in the second reading debate, has gone through a very extensive consultation process and this is the time frame that has been identified as part of that process. I think it is difficult for senators to determine what is reasonably practicable for some of these entities simply by having a discussion on the Senate floor. I share some of the concerns of Senator Griff and Senator Ludlam regarding expeditious notification. I would note that there were changes to this section, 26WH, as a result of the consultations, so our view is that it would be best at the moment to proceed with the time frame that was the subject of lengthy consultation.</span>

The 30 days is a maximum under section 26WH, but section 26WH also imposes a requirement that the party upon whom the obligation is cast must undertake an 'expeditious assessment'. So it may well be that an assessment is able to be undertaken in a much shorter period of time than 30 days. Thirty days is the outside, it is a statutory maximum, but against an obligation to deal with the matter expeditiously. It is the obligation, in fact, to deal with the matter expeditiously that is the governing obligation here, and then some guidance is to be given as to what is beyond reasonable compliance with that obligation of expedition. That is within at least 30 days but it may be sooner.</span>

The second two amendments—which I will move shortly, once we have dealt with this one—go to the fact that with many data breaches, such as those that I, Labor senators and Senator Griff identified during our contributions, it takes some time before some of these companies or departments even know that they have had a breach. So the clock is not ticking from the time they realise they have lost control of people's information but from the time that the breach occurs. That could be weeks, months or, in some cases, years after the breach is discovered. I believe that in most cases in the list of examples I read earlier it was a period of weeks before the breach was actually discovered, at which point your obligations begin.</span>

That implies that the ICT teams get moving and try to identify what has actually happened. What we do not want to have is companies and departments being tied up for up to 30 days, working as rapidly as they can, trying to figure out whether they are obliged to report the breach. We would rather just see, on balance, that the reporting happens earlier. That will go to the second amendment that we are going to move shortly. We think 30 days is far too long and we also believe you have identified the reason that it is far too long in your own explanatory memorandum, where you have said—I am going to put this on the record one last time:</span>

It defines whether the bill works as intended. If the threshold is set too high then almost nothing will get reported and we can pat our backs and say that we all worked here in a very crosspartisan way to improve the law but in real life almost nothing will have changed because these breaches can still occur and people will not be notified. If the threshold is set too low then you risk what some submitters have identified as notification fatigue.

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I think, Mr Temporary Chair Bernardi, when you made a contribution earlier you alluded to this issue as well. There is confusion about whether you have obligations under this act or not. The Privacy Foundation continued:</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We do not want to pass this bill into law if the threshold is set so high that people will be given their 30 days and will decide that serious harm has not been done. These amendments effectively amend two different parts of the bill to say that if the disclosure 'would be likely to result in harm to any of the individuals to whom the information relates or is a significant data breach' then you are caught, then you report, then you disclose, then you notify. That should really cut down on some of the red tape that Senator Bernardi was referring to. It should cut down on the need for 30 days. The assumption is one of disclosure, and we think that is entirely appropriate.</span>

It is, I hope you would agree, important that legislation that imposes what is potentially 'quite an onerous obligation' on those who hold data applies only to non-trivial breaches, breaches that are causative of harm and are significant. It is very difficult—indeed, I dare say impossible—to legislatively define the threshold at which one considers a breach to be non-harmful or non-trivial and therefore in these circumstances it is necessary to use reasonably generic language. </span>

I readily acknowledge that different minds will differ as to where the line should be drawn between trivial and non-trivial breaches and harmful and non-harmful breaches, but, as I said, if one accepts that the legislation should apply only to non-trivial breaches and should apply only to harmful breaches then in the absence of any more precise capacity to formulate that in the statute it will be formulated by practice and the development of precedent guided by the guidelines of the Office of the Australian Information Commissioner.</span>

In fact, I think I agree with everything that you put. The distinction that I am trying to draw is that, the way the bill is currently drafted, an obligation will not apply to an entity unless it believes that serious harm has occurred. The distinction that you are drawing between trivial or nonharmful conduct and harmful conduct is precisely where I think we should be drawing the line, but the bill, as drafted, does not do that. Presently, an entity can decide—after the maximum of 30 days and after it has expeditiously done its assessment—that it has in fact caused harm and still not be caught by the bill, because it might have decided that it was not serious harm. I am at a bit of a loss, Senator Brandis, because I agree with your description of how the bill should work but I do not think it is how the bill will work. My reading is that the amendment the Australian Greens are putting forward would draw the bill closer to the way that you just described you believe it should operate.</span>

One further point I should have made in the observations that I made a few moments ago is that this is subject to a reasonable person test. In section 26WE the test is whether a reasonable person would likely believe that the data breach would cause significant harm. Senator Ludlam, as you know, it is a very commonplace device in the law to subject these kinds of criteria—which cannot be defined on a case-by-case basis, because of the infinite variety of potential circumstances to which they might attach—to a reasonable person test, and that has been done. I think I will stop there. What we are trying to achieve is not very far apart, if not essentially the same. There are various ways of testing this. As a result of quite extensive consultations, the government has landed at adopting the test that I have expressed. That is a test that is workable and can be informed by practice, precedent and the guidelines of the Information Commissioner.</span>

I believe we are fairly close in what we are trying to do and I have no problem with the reasonable person test or with their reasonableness—that is a longstanding practice—but the test that this abstract reasonable person would be applying is not between whether nontrivial or nonharmful and trivial or harmful conduct has occurred; the distinction that they would be asked to draw is whether or not serious harm has been done. That is where I have a problem. As the Privacy Foundation and other submitters suggested, an entity would be able to draw the conclusion that it had caused harm to people and yet still not be subject to the operation of this bill. That is certainly, Senator Brandis, not how you have been describing it. You have been describing it in the way that I would hope the law would operate. Under this bill, an entity would be able to draw the conclusion that it had caused harm to its users but that, because it was not serious harm, it did not need to disclose it. I think that is completely unacceptable. That is all we are trying to fix this morning.</span>

                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">South Australia</span>—<span class="HPS-MinisterialTitles">Leader of the Opposition in the Senate</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">13:06</span>):  I rise to speak on the Criminal Code Amendment (Firearms Trafficking) Bill 2016 on behalf of the opposition and I indicate at the outset that, with amendments, the opposition will be supporting this bill. We welcome the chance to strengthen Australia's laws to combat firearms trafficking. There is a growing firearms problem in Australia, and there is growing gun crime in our communities. The Australian Criminal Intelligence Commission estimates that there are as many as 600,000 illicit firearms in the community. Once firearms fall into the illicit market, it is extremely difficult to get them back, and they can all too easily end up, as we know, in the hands of criminals, gangs and terrorists. We can and we must do more to tackle illicit firearms.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The Australian community rightly expects the government of the day to take responsible and effective steps to crack down on gun crime. On this measure, the government is failing the community. We saw this most clearly last year, when this government was at war with itself on firearms policy. It was a government so focused on its own internal division that it could not provide the leadership Australians expect their government to show on matters of community safety. Today we see the Turnbull government trying to distract the community from this division. When leadership is called for, what we see yet again is cheap politics. Instead of putting forward sensible measures which would address this problem, the government continues to put forward failed Abbott government measures in a desperate attempt to distract from the fact that it is hopelessly divided on guns.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The bill proposed by the government would see the introduction new mandatory minimum sentences of five years for the offences of trafficking firearms and firearms parts within Australia; and trafficking firearms and firearms parts into and out of Australia. It would also amend maximum penalties to imprisonment for 20 years or a fine of 5,000 penalty units or both. This is the third time that this Liberal government has attempted to introduce mandatory minimum sentences for firearms-trafficking offences. On each previous occasion, the Senate has wisely rejected such measures, and I ask the Senate to consider doing so again. The opposition has circulated an amendment to remove the mandatory minimum penalties in this bill. The reason for this is very simple: mandatory minimum sentences do not work. State prosecutors, including the directors of public prosecutions in New South Wales and Tasmania, have criticised them. The legal profession is opposed to them. Experts agree they are ineffective in making the community safer. One would have hoped that that is the measure that the government of the day should apply, not cheap politics.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">In fact, in its very own document, <span style="font-style:italic;">A g</span><span style="font-style:italic;">uide to framing </span><span style="font-style:italic;">C</span><span style="font-style:italic;">ommonwealth offences, infringement notices and enforcement powers</span>, the Attorney-General's own department says that mandatory sentences should be avoided. In that document, Senator Brandis's department states that mandatory minimum sentences interfere with judicial discretion to impose a penalty appropriate in the circumstances of a particular case; may create an incentive for a defendant to fight charges, even where there is little merit in doing so; preclude the use of alternative sanctions; and may encourage the judiciary to look for technical grounds to avoid a restriction on sentencing discretion, leading to anomalous decisions. And reviews of the implementation of such provisions confirm these concerns.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">In December 2015, the Northern Territory Department of the Attorney-General and Justice published a review of the Northern Territory Sentencing Amendment (Mandatory Minimum Sentences) Act 2013. It was assessed that the introduction of mandatory minimum prison terms 'resulted in an increase in the length of time and number of court appearances required to finalise defendants who pled guilty, and may have contributed to a decrease in the percentage of defendants with a final guilty plea'. In other words, you tie up more of the court's time and get fewer outcomes. Not only do these measures drain precious law enforcement resources; they increase the chances of reoffending. It is therefore unsurprising that the government has been unable to provide any evidence in the EM to this bill to support the idea that mandatory minimum sentences for firearms trafficking will enhance or sustain Australia's firearm's control regime by deterring potential offenders. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Of course, this chamber and the Australian people have not forgotten that this government has been playing politics with our world-leading gun laws for more than a year. We all saw just how cynically the coalition could behave when we learnt that the government was trading guns for votes. Trying to use the mass importation of a rapid-fire lever-action for its own political gain has to be one of the low points over the last few years. It was a government willing to trade community safety for partisan advantage—a shameful episode. And, of course, when it suited them, the Turnbull government also welched on its deal with Senator Leyonhjelm. It broke its word to a senator and it failed in its most important duty: to ensure the safety of the Australian community.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Who can forget last year, when we saw Prime Minister Turnbull and his predecessor, Mr Abbott, openly contradict each other on the floor of the House of Representatives? Then, in this chamber, we saw the National Party split from the Liberals on the floor of the Senate, with cabinet ministers being very conveniently absent and Nationals senators voting to let a dangerous weapon into the country. On national television, we saw the Deputy Prime Minister, Mr Joyce, contradict Mr Turnbull's position. And we saw members of the government, including Senator McKenzie, Senator Williams, the member for Parkes, the member for Flynn and the member for Moore all calling for a weakening of our gun laws. This bitter division on guns, the way this has played into the Liberal—</span>

This bitter division on guns and this weakness of leadership and the division inside the government, which was played out so clearly on the floor of both the House and the Senate through that time has very real consequences. We have a government that is much more focused on internal division and on playing political games than on good, strong and effective policy. In fact, on this government's watch, a record number of weapons have flooded into the illicit market. The Australian Criminal Intelligence Commission estimates that 10,000 of the guns in the illicit market are handguns—the weapon of choice for gangs and criminals. </span>

And we can and must do more to find these guns and stop them being trafficked across state boundaries. The reintroduction of the ineffective measures that are set out in this bill, for a third time, is not amongst the appropriate responses. It is just an attempt to distract from the fact that we see a government still divided on guns. </span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The opposition has also circulated an amendment to introduce new aggravated firearms trafficking offences, with a maximum penalty of life in prison. I propose to expand on the detail of the amendment in the committee debate rather than in the second reading debate. Labor believe that the amendments we propose, comprising tough new aggravated offences, alongside the higher maximum penalty for the basic firearms trafficking offences in the bill, which we support, will send a clear message that gun trafficking is as serious as drug trafficking and will attract the same severe penalties.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We all saw the government's real commitment to gun control last year, when it was prepared, extraordinarily, to trade guns for votes and water down Australia's gun laws. The opposition had sincerely hoped that the government's approach to our gun laws could have improved this year. Unfortunately, it does not appear to have been the case. That is a disappointment to all Australians who want to see effective action taken against gun crime.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal"> The opposition will continue to fight for tough gun laws. While the Turnbull government reheats failed Abbott government proposals, we are putting forward strong and sensible measures that will actually contribute to the fight against firearms trafficking. I commend the opposition amendments, to be moved in the Committee of the Whole. I would encourage the government to approach this area of policy not with tired political games but with a sensible approach to ensure that we do in fact make our community safer.</span>

                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">
                    <a href="CPR" type="MemberSpeech">
                      <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Senator RHIANNON</span>
                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">New South Wales</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">13:15</span>):  When it comes to debating gun control measures, or what appear to be gun control measures, in this house that come from the Turnbull government or from any Liberal-National government, one needs to look at them very closely. Increasingly, this government is seen to walk both sides of the road. They try to make out on the public record that they are concerned about public safety and that they are attempting to deal with gun crime. But, when you look at the actual detail, they have not brought forward measures that would actually deliver in that sense. The question that is very relevant to this debate is why that is. It is because there are competing interests between the Nationals and some Liberals, particularly around the issue of winning support.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I saw this at very close quarters in the New South Wales parliament with the rise of the shooters party. They were first elected to that parliament in 1995. I understand it was the first parliament where they gained elected representatives. From that moment, sadly with the Labor Party as well as the Liberal Party and the Nationals, there was a real courting of the section of the community that votes largely on issues to do with greater availability of firearms. How this will play out is very troubling for the security and the safety of people here in this country.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We need to be very mindful of that factor—that so much of how the government handle firearms issues is now coloured by their interests in trying to make out that they are out there looking after the gun lobby, everything from individual shooters across to the actual industry itself, from the importers to those who sell firearms. They are trying to make out that they are out there looking after the shooters and looking after the industry by weakening gun control measures. We see that so clearly with the National Firearms Agreement being weakened and with the relevant minister recently being outed on how he refers to that fine document. I have put on the record many times that that is one issue that I do pay credit to the former Prime Minister John Howard for. The current minister calls it 'red tape' and is now working with the industry on how they will deal with that red tape. That is the lens that we have to examine in the debate that is before us now.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">If the Turnbull government were serious about reducing gun crime, they would toughen up on imports, tighten licensing and increase coordination between state and federal law enforcement agencies. There is a lot of talk these days across so many areas—education and transport—of industry about how we have to have consistency across the country. When it comes to something so obvious as consistency with regard to laws covering firearms and the movement of firearms in their sale, there is virtually no consistency in all.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Having that coordination between state and federal law enforcement agencies would include requiring the various state police forces to have well-functioning digital databases where information could be readily shared between law enforcement agencies at a state, territory and federal level. How logical is that? I am sure there are people in those agencies who have probably been trying to achieve that but are getting stymied because what works for the pro-gun lobby is not having that coordination in place. They do not want the restrictions and they do not want that data to be available on lost and stolen weapons.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">There are a lot of wrong things going on in this industry, and I would really ask anybody who comes in on this debate to not try and distort the Greens' position to make it seem like we want to shut down guns and not allow anybody to have a gun, even sporting shooters. We totally acknowledge there is a place for that, but what has to be primary is public safety, and that is certainly not being delivered by the legislation before us.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Just staying with this theme about the need for well-functioning digital databases in Queensland their firearms registry is a joke. It is well known that it is so antiquated that it is virtually useless. It is largely nonshareable and does not capture very important information. This is where we need to identify that it is a priority. What we have is the government coming up with that favourite line of conservatives, banging the law-and-order drum and trying to scare people and talking about increased sentences, when we know for a fact that that will not reduce gun crime. We know that is the case. If you look at some of the work that has come out of the Australian Criminal Intelligence Commission, they have put out a report. They said:</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">… illegal importation accounts for a comparatively small percentage of illicit firearms.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I put that on the record that. Again, it is about identifying the problem. It is a furphy saying the problem here is external. The problem is internal. We are now into 2017 and we still have not got the coordination of these databases so we know about the movement of guns out into the illegal market. Clearly the government are barking up the wrong tree here. We saw that again with how the whole debate around the Adler played out—about importing that and the magazine extensions that were involved there. They have been very deceptive about how all this is playing out.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I also want to raise that I understand the Labor Party have amendments and that their position on mandatory sentencing is consistent with ours. We are pleased to support those amendments because we know that increased sentences are largely ineffective in reducing crime. There have been so many studies on this, and I really do imagine that most people are aware of this. There was a recent one from BOCSAR, and they said:</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">Increasing the length of stay in prison beyond current levels does not appear to impact on the crime rate after accounting for increases in arrest and imprisonment likelihood.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Again: is the government really serious about public safety, about ensuring that there are not more firearms moving into the illegal market? When you look into the detail of it you really find it hard to take the government seriously on what they say they want to achieve here.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Each Australian jurisdiction maintains a separate firearms registry and details, and individual licence holders are required to advise the appropriate registry when they dispose of or receive a firearm from interstate. But the accuracy of that is what is being questioned. In fact, in this day and age, having a well-functioning digital database where this information can be readily shared should be the starting point here. At the moment a powerful gun lobby is increasingly operating in this country. We know from various boasts from sections of the pro-gun lobby in this country—some of the statements made in the last federal election—of close contacts with the National Rifle Association in the States, with advice and sometimes personnel coming from that organisation on how to elevate support for a pro-firearm stance, a stance to weaken gun-control measures. That is penetrating the electoral process here.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">So, we need to have that awareness, because this bill before us is not going to achieve what the government is making out that it will. Public safety is not the primary factor here. It is really a smokescreen—saying that action is being taken when it is largely business as usual for the firearm lobby and the intersection between the illegal market and the legal use of firearms. This is not the advance that we needed, and the Greens will continue to take up this matter and support a number of the amendments before us. Thank you.</span>

                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">
                    <a href="I0V" type="MemberSpeech">
                      <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Senator WILLIAMS</span>
                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">New South Wales</span>—<span class="HPS-MinisterialTitles">Nationals Whip in the Senate</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">13:24</span>):  I welcome this legislation, the Criminal Code Amendment (Firearms Trafficking) Bill 2016, and let me explain why. I supported the gun buyback by the Howard government. At the time I had eight guns and rifles and I had to hand one in, a semiautomatic .22. It did not worry me one bit to get paid to hand it back, because I saw it as a dangerous weapon—a semiautomatic—the reason being that if it holds 10 shots in a magazine then you might shoot off four shots for some vermin or whatever you are trying to kill and then the weapon is left loaded, ready to go—dangerous. I have never been a big fan of semiautomatics.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">But I discussed this with one of my state National Party friends some years back. The taxpayer spent over $300 million buying the guns back, the rifles back, from innocent people, who were innocent enough to hand them in. We set up a register of the rifles' and guns' ownership. It did not worry me, when I was a young fella living in South Australia—you had to register your guns back in the seventies. If you bought an air rifle, you took it down to the police station and registered it. They had the name of who owned that air rifle. So, registration never worried me one bit. It was part of my life. And you, Acting Deputy President Gallacher, coming from South Australia: if you ever bought any weapons you would be in the same situation.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">What I found frustrating was that the innocent people did the right thing: handed their weapons in. The taxpayers of Australia forked out the $304 million to buy the weapons back when they were destroyed or whatever back then. And we have a situation in which a black market exists in firearms. Now, I think it would be the scariest experience of your life if you were working at a service station at two o'clock in the morning and someone walked in and put a pistol to your face. That would be scary, and, sadly, it does happen. Where does the weapon come from? It is probably stolen or brought in on the black market. So, I think this is good legislation because it has a mandatory minimum sentence of five years for anyone trafficking in weapons or weapon parts.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The reason we have to have this is because of what John Laws calls jelly judges. How often do we see people charged with serious crime and the punishment does not fit the crime? It simply does not. A minimum sentence is a strong message to those out there who are contemplating trafficking weapons and the black marketing of them—bring them in from China somehow in containers stashed away, hidden, and it is up to Customs to keep doing their fine job to keep a close eye on what actually comes into our country as far as the black market goes, and what is stashed, hiding in containers and various packages. But seeing this sends a strong message that if you get involved in the black marketing of weapons and you sell them on the streets—Mr Acting Deputy President, I would say it would be a fair guess that if you gave me $1,000 in cash and I went to some parts of Sydney then within a day I would have a black market pistol. I say that with confidence.</span>

Give me $1,000 cash; I will put on a wig, a beard, an earring, some jeans and thongs and go underground to see if I could buy a weapon in Sydney. I think at the end of the day I would have a black market weapon, for sure.</span>

                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">But the point I make, again, is that the Howard government led the debate with the states to bring in the laws, a register—tougher gun laws. We handed our guns in. Senator Wong was saying that I support slackening the laws. No. With the Adler, under class A—shotguns are in class A—I wanted the Adler seven shot to go into class B. As a farmer, I can have a class B rifle; I can get a 44 Magnum 10 shot repeater under class B. Why wouldn't you put a seven shot shotgun in class B? I see it as a tool of trade for the farmers, especially helicopter shooting of wild pigs. I had one senator say to me, 'You can't shoot wild pigs with shotguns!' I said, 'Of course you do.' In fact, Mark Coulton, the member for Parkes, was telling me that in a helicopter day out over the Gwydir wetlands last year 900 pigs were shot. They use No. 4 cartridges and No. 5, used for shooting much smaller birds or whatever—pests. They use SGs or SSGs—large lead shells. That was a tool of the trade. I would like to have seen that go into category B, as Minister Troy Grant, the police minister in New South Wales, suggested. I think he was right. It was not easing the gun laws. It was in class A and it had been there for many years. Class A is too lenient for a seven-shot repeat shotgun. There is no problem at all for the slow-moving projectile from a double-barrel or single-barrel gun.</span>

                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Back to this debate, all my life I have heard of people committing various criminal activities—terrible crimes. Then you hear their punishment and you think, 'What is the judge doing? Oh, they were brought up in a single family. They had a bad upbringing; they were neglected; they were beaten or whatever.' The punishment does not fit the crime—we hear of that situation so often. It must be terribly frustrating for the police who get out there and catch the criminals and DPP prosecutors put them through the court. They are found guilty but when it comes to sentencing, it is just a smack on the hand with a feather. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I support this legislation and I have wanted it for many years. I am glad to see it coming through at a federal level. I thought we would have to go through the states, and so it is good it is coming through the federal parliament so that it sends a clear message right across Australia, which says: 'You break the law, you traffic in illegal weapons. You try to bring our society down, you try to make money out of this by putting weapons in the hands of people who should not have hold of them—people who would rob banks or service stations or commit murder and serious harm to fellow Australians.' They should be punished severely, and this legislation does exactly that.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">In winding up, I have explained why the gun buyback was there and why the Adler seven shot should have gone into category B. That is the case for the National Firearms Agreement between the states to work through that issue. I am very pleased to see these minimum laws come in, because, as I say for a third time, we see so many judges and magistrates hand out punishments that simply do not fit the crime. If that is going to be the case, we will see more of this legislation come through state and federal parliaments over the years ahead. When we see judges handing out a punishment that is too lenient, too soft, there is no deterrent for the general public to commit that crime. There has to be a deterrent, and then people know that if they go in for trafficking guns or weapons and pistols and if they get caught—and it is highly likely that they will—it is five years in the pen minimum. It is a very good thing to send a strong message to the minority of Australian people who wish to get involved in this industry and do the wrong thing that this is what you are going to face under the legislation. I support the legislation.</span>

                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">

                      <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Senator SINGH</span>
                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Tasmania</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">13:32</span>):  The reintroduction of these measures is clearly a desperate attempt by government to distract from the fact that it is hopelessly divided when it comes to guns—among other things. Of course, Labor supports tougher penalties for firearms trafficking, but we will not support measures which are ineffective. What we seek to do is to remove the mandatory minimum sentences which do not work and instead we propose amendments to introduce new offences for aggravated firearms trafficking with a maximum sentence of life in prison.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Let's recap on the history of this bill. The coalition government introduced it to give effect to mandatory minimum sentences to those found guilty of trafficking illegal firearms, despite the last parliament rejecting these measures twice. Yet here we are again, Groundhog Day, with the introduction of this bill. In February 2015, Labor successfully moved amendments in the Senate to remove the introduction of mandatory minimum sentencing contained in the government's Crimes Legislation Amendment (Psychoactive Substances and Other Measures) Bill 2014. In August 2015 Labor was again successful in moving amendments in the Senate to remove the reintroduction of mandatory minimum sentences, this time in the Crimes Legislation Amendment (Powers, Offences and Other Measures) Bill 2015. Now we have the Criminal Code Amendment (Firearms Trafficking) Bill 2016 before us.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">There is no convincing evidence to prove that mandatory minimums act as a deterrent, and presumably that is the whole point of the government's intent in this legislation. We know this because the minister's own department has said that mandatory sentences may create an incentive for a defendant to fight charges, even in hopeless cases. The Attorney-General's Department's document, 'Guide to framing Commonwealth offences, infringement notices and enforcement powers' states at 3.1 that minimum penalties should be avoided. The government is ignoring its own departmental advice. Why did the Attorney-General's Department say they should be avoided? Because they, inter alia, may: 'interfere with judicial discretion to impose a penalty appropriate in the circumstances of a particular case'; 'create an incentive for a defendant to fight charges, even where there is little merit in doing so'; 'preclude the use of alternative sanctions such as community service orders that would otherwise be available in Part IB of the Crimes Act 1914'; and 'encourage the judiciary to look for technical grounds to avoid a restriction on sentencing discretion, leading to anomalous decisions'.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Further to all of that evidence which the government had before it, the Senate Committee on Legal and Constitutional Affairs received evidence from a number of stakeholders in inquiries for the two previous bills, which I outlined earlier, who strongly opposed the introduction of those amendments. The Law Council of Australia referred to a number of unintended consequences of mandatory sentencing, which included 'undermining the community's confidence in the judiciary and the criminal justice system as a whole'. The Australian Human Rights Commission noted that these 'amendments give rise to the potential for injustices to occur' and 'run counter to the fundamental principle that punishment should fit the crime'. There were also concerns previously raised by state prosecutors, who believed that these provisions could lead to unjust results and impose a significant burden on the justice system.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Here we have the government moving into its rhetoric, unfortunately, which it continues to do rather than look at the facts, rather than look at the evidence, rather than a look at its own government department's advice. But this, I think, all comes down to the government's bitter division and disunity within itself on gun control. It has still not come out and supported the measures that we put forward, and now it is 2017. So, yes, Labor will stand on the side of reason and will push for tough new penalties to allow judges to put the worst gun traffickers away for life. And Labor will, as I mentioned, recognise that tougher penalties for firearms trafficking is an important step when looking at the evidence provided.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Last year was a very telling year in gun control. The government lost on gun control last year. Tony Abbott and Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull were both willing to let the dangerous Adler A110 lever action shot gun into Australia in exchange of course, as we know, for a vote in this place. The National Party then split from the Liberals on the floor of the Senate, voting to let a dangerous weapon into this country. The Deputy Prime Minister, Barnaby Joyce, then contradicted Malcolm Turnbull's position on national television and members of Malcolm Turnbull's own party came out in favour of weaker gun laws. It was an absolute shemozzle. And that shemozzle has not gone away. That division is still there within this government. If we needed to see any evidence of that division in the last week, it was the resignation of Senator Bernardi from the Liberal Party, who simply could not stomach the rank hypocrisy within this government any longer. But under this government's watch, a record number of weapons have flooded into the illicit market. Right now the Australian Criminal Intelligence Commission estimates that there are more than 260,000 firearms in the illicit firearms market and possibly as many as 600,000. The commission estimates that 10,000 of these are hand guns, the weapon of choice for gangs and criminals and the like. But of course the government is too divided to fight it.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The Liberal Party and the Nationals are too divided on guns to take meaningful action to address this issue of illicit firearms. The reintroduction of these very ineffective measures for the third time in this place is just an attempt to distract from the fact that they are still divided. It is about smoke and mirrors to show that they are doing something. Well that something is certainly not good enough.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The Labor Party is the only party that is willing to protect our world-leading gun laws. Coming from the state of Tasmania and recognising the steps that former Prime Minister John Howard made—something very much supported by both sides of parliament after that atrocious and terrible event that occurred in Port Arthur—I have a duty to ensure that we have and continue to have world-leading gun laws, not a weakening of them and not the introduction of these illicit firearms of the magnitude that I just outlined coming into this country.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The proposals put forward by the Abbott and Turnbull governments to tackle firearms trafficking only contain maximum sentences of 20 years. Labor believes that prosecutors should be able to pursue tougher penalties for the worst forms of firearms trafficking. In 2012, Labor introduced legislation that would have created an aggravated offence for firearms trafficking with a maximum sentence of life imprisonment, the same as the maximum penalty for drug trafficking. These measures passed the House of Representatives with the support of the coalition at that time. But the bill lapsed in the Senate at the end of the 43rd Parliament. So Labor is seeking to amend this bill to implement these provisions, which we proposed when we were in government. That is the consistent nature, the consistent policy position of this party as opposed to the constant inconsistency that we continue to see from the coalition. These amendments that we put forward are for new aggravated offences for people who traffic 50 or more firearms or firearm parts either within Australia or across its borders in a six-month period. The maximum penalty for these offences will be life imprisonment and this will send a very strong message that trafficking in firearms and the violence that it creates will not be tolerated.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The Liberals are proposing ineffective measures in order to distract from the fact that they are weak on gun control. Labor is proposing tougher measures to create new aggravated offences with the strongest penalties available—that is, life imprisonment. And only Labor can be trusted to protect Australia's world-leading gun laws. The government's fixation on mandatory minimum sentences makes, I think, a hollow mockery out of the Australian people's desire for our community to be safe. It really does make a mockery of it. If the government really does support tougher gun laws, it will vote for Labor's tough aggravated trafficking offences.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I would like to highlight the importance of why we should be delivering this, not just for the community but also because we are a part of something a bit broader. We are part of a number of treaties when it comes to dealing with trafficking of firearms. Looking at it from a criminal justice angle, for example, not only is there the United Nations Convention against Transnational Organized Crime but also the Protocol against the Illicit Manufacturing of and Trafficking In Firearms, their Parts and Components and Ammunition supplementing the United Nations Convention against Transnational Organized Crime treaty series. I understand we have signed that protocol; I think we have not yet ratified it, and I would hope to see that we do that. There is the Arms Trade Treaty as well. There are a number of instruments other than those important treaties that we also need to take into account as to why this is important when we are talking about the trafficking of firearms, because it could be trafficking within our country, out of our country or into our country; it could be trafficking of parts of guns, whole guns, all of the components or the ammunition. All of that needs to be taken into account. That is our multilateral framework that we act upon when looking into how we form policies to make our community safe and go forward with tougher gun laws.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Finally, I want to highlight the fact that this government, as I think I made fairly clear, is not serious about tough gun laws. Labor are pursuing tough new penalties to allow judges to put the worst gun traffickers away for life because we are serious about tough gun laws. That is the whole point and meaning behind our amendments. We all know that the government trades its vote with some crossbench senators in this place, but I cannot think of a more important issue right now to not trade a vote in relation to than not weakening gun laws. Yet last year we saw the government do just that. We saw the government trade guns for votes. Mr Turnbull and Mr Abbott at that time contradicted each other on the floor of parliament. The Nationals then split from the Liberal Party, voting to weaken our gun laws. Do you really think that division has gone away? The government is too busy fighting within itself to come up with effective policies to fight gun crime. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I outlined figures from the Australian Criminal Intelligence Commission of 600,000 illegal weapons in circulation in Australia. The fact that the community is simply at risk with these numbers of guns circulating illegally in the market should be something to cause alarm for this government. That should be a reason in itself for the government to not trade guns for votes. Once guns enter that illegal market, they are difficult to get back. We do not want to see in our community these illegal guns stay on the streets and be available to criminals, gangs and terrorists. That is why we need these tough gun laws, and that is why Labor, in putting our amendments forwards, very much hope the government will support them.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We have had enough, though, of the Prime Minister's weakness on guns. We have had enough of the Prime Minister's backflips on a number of policy issues and the fact that he does not stand for what he believes in anymore, but weakness on guns is simply unacceptable. It is beyond the pale. We are moving these substantial amendments to this bill, to create the new aggravated firearms trafficking offences, because we need serious action, not absurd and childish game-playing within the Liberal and National parties. I hope the coalition stop wasting the time of this Senate and the time of the Australian community and start acting on the tougher gun laws that Labor have put forward. They should stop wasting time on things that simply do not work. I hope that they join Labor in putting serious gun traffickers away for life, and the only way to do that is to support Labor's amendments.</span>

                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">South Australia</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">13:49</span>):  I rise to speak on the Criminal Code Amendment (Firearms Trafficking) Bill 2016. This bill is identical to the bill introduced in the 44th Parliament. The bill before us amends the Commonwealth Criminal Code in order to set new mandatory minimum penalties and maximum penalties for the offences of trafficking firearms and firearm parts within Australia and trafficking firearms and firearm parts into and out of Australia. Under the government's proposal, each of these offences in the Commonwealth Criminal Code will apply the following penalties:</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">… a mandatory minimum sentence of imprisonment for five years, and</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">maximum penalties of imprisonment for 20 years or a fine of 5,000 penalty units, or both.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This bill and its predecessor have been the subject of two Senate inquiries. During both of the inquiries, submissions raised significant concerns about mandatory minimum penalties. The Nick Xenophon Team supports the intent of this bill but shares the concerns of agencies and state prosecutors about mandatory minimum sentences for firearm trafficking offences.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This is the fourth time the parliament has considered similar provisions related to mandatory minimum sentences to those proposed in this bill. Similar provisions were included in the Crimes Legislation Amendment (Psychoactive Substances and Other Measures) Bill 2014 and the Crimes Legislation Amendment (Powers, Offences and Other Measures) Bill 2015. While both bills were passed, in each case this only occurred after amendments in this chamber removed mandatory minimum sentence provisions. The Nick Xenophon Team maintains that mandatory minimum sentences are inappropriate and that these provisions should be rejected once again. Currently, there are no mandatory minimum penalties in the Commonwealth Criminal Code. Mandatory minimum penalties do exist in the Commonwealth Migration Act, at section 236B, which contains mandatory minimum sentences for certain people-smuggling related offences. However, this is a rare example.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">There is no doubt that firearms cause serious harms and that firearms trafficking offences are serious crimes that pose a significant threat to community safety. The Nick Xenophon Team acknowledges the government's objective of ensuring that sentences reflect the seriousness of the offences they relate to. However, we cannot support the provisions relating to mandatory minimum penalties, because to do so would contravene the separation of powers by limiting the role of the judiciary. The mandatory minimum sentence provisions in this bill would thereby operate as a partial restriction of judicial discretion that would hamper the sentencing judge's ability to hand down a sentence that is appropriate after taking into account all of the circumstances of the individual case. It is the role of the legislature to forbid certain conduct through laws. The community relies on us to strike the right balance when passing laws designed to keep them safe. The role of the judiciary is to apply those laws with the expertise and knowledge they have acquired as judicial officers to each and every case on an individual basis. In doing so, they are utilising their judicial discretion to determine what penalty should apply for contravening those laws.</span>

                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Mandatory minimum sentences depart from the fundamental principle that punishment for criminal offences should fit the crime. By arbitrarily establishing a minimum sentence in advance for every case of a particular type, mandatory minimums risk disproportionate outcomes in individual cases where the specified minimum is not justified in the circumstances. Unjust outcomes result from mandatory minimums where the circumstances of a particular case indicate that a lesser penalty is in fact appropriate.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I bring to the attention of the chamber the current version of the publication <span style="font-style:italic;">A Guide to Framing Commonwealth Offences, Infringement Notices and Enforcement Powers</span> produced by the Attorney-General's Department advising that minimum penalties should not be used. Specifically, at page 38 the government's guide states:</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">While there are some examples of minimum penalties for Commonwealth offences, fixed or minimum penalties should also be avoided for the following reasons:</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Small">Fixed and minimum penalties can interfere with the discretion of a court to impose a penalty appropriate in the circumstances of a particular case.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Small">Defendants may be less likely to cooperate with authorities if such cooperation cannot be reflected in sentencing. Fixed and minimum penalties create an incentive for a defendant to fight charges, even where there is little merit in doing so.</span>

                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;        margin-left:&#xD;&#xA;      35.45pt;&#xD;&#xA;        &#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:-6.1pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">Fixed and minimum penalties preclude the use of alternative sanctions available in Part IB of the Crimes Act, such as community service orders. In particular cases, these alternatives provide a more effective mechanism for deterrence or rehabilitation.</span>

                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;        margin-left:&#xD;&#xA;      35.45pt;&#xD;&#xA;        &#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:-6.1pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">Industry confidence in an enforcement system directed at industry regulation is undermined where less serious cases do not result in lesser penalties.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Small">The judiciary may look for technical grounds to escape restrictions on sentencing discretion when faced with minimum penalties, leading to anomalous decisions.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">These guidelines illustrate that the contentious element of this bill remains the introduction of mandatory minimum sentencing. Mandatory minimum sentences are uncommon in Australian law with only a handful of examples in state legislation and in the example I previously noted.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The research is clear on mandatory minimum sentences that show they disproportionately affect poor, minority and disadvantaged groups in society. There is no evidence that mandatory minimum sentences reduce crime, but there is much evidence that it can lead to manifest injustice. Despite strong criticism from criminology experts, judicial officers and the legal profession it is concerning that this government remains determined to remove the courts' power to impose a penalty it sees fits, even though all the evidence suggests that this does not actually assist in crime prevention. There is no evidence that mandatory minimum sentences act as deterrents to firearms trafficking. The explanatory memorandum to the bill asserts that these amendments will achieve 'reductions in gun-related violence', without producing any evidence from Australia or overseas to justify such an assertion.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We believe that effective deterrence is achieved by increasing penalties applicable to the most serious firearms offenders rather than the imposition of mandatory prison terms at the other end of the scale. Increasing maximum penalties for firearms trafficking would adequately reflect genuine community concern about the consequences of firearms offences. We understand the government wanting to send a strong message to criminals about the consequences with this bill, although we believe that increasing the maximum penalties is appropriate, necessary and sufficient to achieve the government's aim here. For the reasons I have outlined, the Nick Xenophon Team will be supporting Labor's amendment to remove the provisions in this bill for mandatory minimum sentences.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The Nick Xenophon Team will also be supporting Labor's amendment to introduce new offences for aggravated firearms trafficking. These offences would apply to the trafficking of 50 or more firearms or firearm parts in a six-month period, with a maximum penalty of life imprisonment or 7,500 penalty units or both. This would make the maximum penalty for trafficking in firearms the same as the maximum penalty for trafficking in drugs, with no mandatory minimum for these offences. There have been a number of high-profile matters, like the 120 Glock pistols that found their way to New South underworld figures after being illegally imported by a gun-smuggling ring, or the cache of six fully automatic assault rifles and 96 semi-automatic handgun frames that were due to be imported to Australia last year, if they had not been intercepted in the US. The infiltration of these illegal firearms into our society could have had catastrophic consequences. The Nick Xenophon Team acknowledges that these new offences are designed to tackle the worst types of gun trafficking and for that reason we support Labor's amendment.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">On behalf of the Nick Xenophon Team I will be moving an amendment to Labor's amendment that will increase the maximum penalty for the basic firearms trafficking offence from 20 years to 30 years imprisonment. The Nick Xenophon Team believes that increasing the maximum penalty for this offence sends a strong, decisive message to both the community and potential offenders that trafficking firearms is not acceptable and the consequences for doing so will meet with harsher penalties.</span>

Let me begin by saying that they are more sophisticated because in this chamber, since they have been here, they have supported important pieces of government legislation. They have been prepared to cooperate with us, and if the opposition were prepared to cooperate with us on more legislation not only would the opposition be more sophisticated but also we would not have to rely on the crossbenches as much. It is important to understand that. In those same remarks on that program yesterday I made the point that when it comes to values there is a clear divide. For example, I said that on this side of the House we believe in a non-discriminatory immigration policy very strongly. We do not discriminate on the basis of ethnicity, race, creed or colour in our immigration program. I made that very clear.</span>

We have a parliament that has been thrown up to us by the Australian people. It includes representatives of the Greens, One Nation and the opposition. We have to work with all sides, and when they are willing to approve or support our legislation we will work with them. As I said before, if the opposition wants us to do less business with One Nation they should support more of our policies—the policies which we promised at the last election. Please help us keep our promises to the Australian people.</span>

The Australian economy is growing faster than all but one of the G7 economies, at twice the rate of the US and Canada and at well above the OECD average. We are, right now, in our 26th year of continuous growth. On Friday Australian time, the IMF released its regular review of the performance of the Australian economy. Their assessment is very compelling indeed. The IMF points out that from mid-2015 the Australian recovery advanced with a marked pickup in activity. The report points out:</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">But there is more. It says the IMF directors:</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">And, of course, we continue to work with the Senate to give effect to our efforts to balance the budget. The report also observed that front loading the consolidation path is appropriate and prudent under the current circumstances. Finally, the report says:</span>

The Turnbull government has a comprehensive national economic plan, which involves making our tax system more growth friendly. The next instalment is our Ten Year Enterprise Tax Plan, which seeks to reduce the corporate tax rate to 25 per cent for all businesses. That is because we understand that in order to ensure that we can create as many jobs as possible in this economy we need businesses across Australia to be as successful and as profitable as possible, so they can hire more Australians and pay them better wages over time. Every respected economist in the world will tell you that a more competitive business tax rate will help you to boost investment and boost productivity, and will help more successful businesses across Australia to hire more Australians. The Labor Party does not get this. The Labor Party seems to think that jobs grow on trees. No, jobs do not grow on trees; jobs are created by hardworking businesses across Australia. <span style="font-style:italic;">(Time expired)</span></span>

Sadly, there is an alternative approach that is promoted by the Labor Party. Under Mr Shorten's leadership, the Labor Party has become the most left-wing Labor Party in the history of the Commonwealth. The Labor Party in Australia today stands for higher taxes, higher energy prices, less trade and more red tape. The Labor Party went to the last election promising more than $100 billion in additional taxes. Senator Bushby asked me about what the implication would be. The implication of higher taxes, higher energy prices, less reliable energy supply, less trade and, indeed, more red tape is less investment and fewer jobs. If you make it harder for business to be successful, which is the Labor Party policy approach, business will be able to employ fewer Australians, which means that unemployment would go up. <span style="font-style:italic;">(Time expired)</span></span>

Senator Sterle, that is a fact. It is entirely a matter for the state executive of the Western Australian division of the Liberal Party to decide whom it should preference. The Liberal Party and the National Party, I am advised, will be preferencing one another in every lower house seat. I am also advised that, in relation to upper house seats, it has not been uncommon for the National Party to preference the One Nation party ahead of the Liberal Party, as occurred in the 2008 election.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">As you know, Senator Sterle, being a Western Australian yourself, the Liberal Party and the National Party are not in coalition government in Western Australia. They are in alliance for the purposes of forming a government but they are not a coalition. There have been occasions in the past, in particular in 2008, when the National Party in Western Australia has, in the upper house, preferenced the One Nation party ahead of the Liberal Party. These decisions are made by the state divisions of political parties, depending on the political circumstances at the time. But I can assure you, Senator Sterle, one thing the Liberal Party in Western Australia is determined to do—and although I do not speak for them, I am sure one thing the National Party in Western Australia is also determined to do—is keep out of office the job-destroying, ruinous policies of the Australian Labor Party.</span>

That is a very important question because on 2 February—that is, at the end of the week before last—the full court of the Federal Court delivered an important decision called McGlade v Native Title Registrar<span style="font-style:italic;"></span>in relation to the single Noongar Settlement. The effect of that decision was to overrule an earlier decision of a single judge of the Federal Court in 2010 in a case called Bygrave (No. 2), which had settled the law in relation to the necessary requisites for an Indigenous land use agreement to be registered. In short, what Justice Reeves had held in Bygrave, which until the week before last was understood to be settled law, was that it was not necessary for all members of the claimant group to consent to the registration of the Indigenous land use agreement, or ILUA.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The McGlade decision some 13 days ago overruled that decision and decided otherwise. This is a very significant development in relation not only to Indigenous land use agreements—of which there are 123 registered in Australia at the moment—but to all Indigenous land use agreements seeking registration because the effect of it is to enable a single member of a claimant group, by withholding their consent, to prevent the registration of the ILUA. This is, as I say, a very significant development in the law. It had not been anticipated.</span>

I refer to the resignation of Professor Clive Hamilton from the Climate Change Authority. Professor Hamilton resigned saying that it was 'perverse' that the government would be boosting coal when 2016 marked the hottest year on record. He also bemoaned the fact that the Climate Change Authority no longer had any role in the development of climate policy in Australia. Minister, with Sydney just having experienced its hottest month on record and New South Wales now in the midst of climate change related bushfires, do you accept the independent advice of the Climate Change Authority that burning more coal will lead to more extreme weather and bushfires such as those being experienced currently in New South Wales?</span>

Nevertheless, I have been advised that Professor Hamilton has resigned as a member of that authority. But I point out that his appointment was due to expire on 30 June in any event. So the departure of Professor Hamilton from the Climate Change Authority has brought the matter forward by some 4½ months. He has served on the Climate Change Authority since 2012.</span>

The fact is, Senator Di Natale—as you should know—that as a result of our signature to the Paris climate change convention Australia has adopted, per capita, the most ambitious emissions reduction targets in the world. And Australia is on track to meet its emissions reduction targets. So, Senator Di Natale, we do not believe, as you do apparently as a matter of ideology, that renewable energy—</span>

As I said in answer to your primary question, under the leadership of Mr Turnbull, at the Paris climate change conference Australia adopted per capita the most ambitious emissions control targets in the world—the most ambitious targets in the world. But also under the leadership of Mr Turnbull the Australian government takes a technology agnostic approach, not an ideological approach, as you do—the very opposite of the science which you constantly invoke, Senator Di Natale, but an ideological approach which refuses to countenance the fact that the best results will be delivered to the Australian public, as they ought to have been delivered to the public of South Australia, by a multi-technology mix that includes renewables but also includes traditional sources, including coal.</span>

Usually, traditionally, they would have a firm commitment to matters concerning national security, but that is glaringly absent in this case, for what appears to be the sake of puerile local politics, as far as I can tell. There is not a lot more to it than that. In fact, the government has been quite clear in saying that the concerns which were raised by landowners and the process of planning that has been underway by the Department of Defence are what led to the decision that I announced last week in relation to the acquisition of land.</span>

It is a process which has been underway for some time between the Department of Defence and other parties, of course including the government of Singapore. The detailed planning which took place and led to the finalisation and signing of the memorandum of understanding with Singapore on 13 October 2016 actually formally set out the agreed parameters of the increased training access that Australia would offer. It represented the formal agreement by both countries to the scale of the increased access Singapore would be offered. That was not finalised until October of last year. Following the signature of the MOU, Defence was then able to begin the process of detailed master planning so that the precise requirements could be clarified and engagement could begin with stakeholders.</span>

As servants to the people of Queensland and Australia, I and people in the One Nation party have repeatedly advocated the need for lower energy prices. These prices are out of control, and an understanding of energy production and its supposed market is clear: it is being distorted by subsidies, the renewable energy target, regulations, bureaucracy, politics and vested interests. Senator Hanson-Young made a brave attempt to patch over her failed policies by trying to blame the renewable energy market but did not succeed. Could Minister Birmingham advise the reasons for the Prime Minister's change of mind and the energy minister's change in policy? Is it politically driven or economically motivated?</span>

Senator Roberts, I can assure you—as I can the entire Senate and all Australians—that everything the Turnbull government does in relation to energy prices, energy reliability, energy affordability and energy security is driven by a desire to ensure that Australia has the most affordable and the most reliable energy possible. We are driven by a desire to make sure both that Australian households, Australian families—be they in Queensland, South Australia or anywhere else—can feel comfortable turning the air conditioning on in summer and turning the heating on in winter and that Australian businesses can feel comfortable knowing that they can invest with confidence, grow and create jobs, whether that is an aluminium smelter in Victoria; Nyrstar, in my home state of South Australia; or any of these businesses.</span>

                  </a>  Thank you, Mr President. I will do my best to make sure that Senator Hinch can hear us as well, because it is important for Senator Roberts and all senators to appreciate that, during the six years of the previous Labor government, electricity prices across Australia rose by 101 per cent. There was a 101 per cent growth in electricity prices during that time, but, under the coalition government—as demonstrated by ABS data released in June 2016—it is clear we have seen the largest fall in electricity prices on record. That, of course, was driven in part through the abolition of the carbon tax and in part through reforms to network regulation that our government has overseen. We are determined to keep working on measures to bring down prices. Of course, our reforms to the renewable energy target to ensure that we have a target that is achievable without the types of pressures that were in place before are further measures in place to try to make sure that electricity generation is more affordable in the future, and we will keep pursuing—as we are through the Finkel review and other mechanisms—means to do so.</span>

Our policy will absolutely be driven by evidence—evidence of what can guarantee reliability, affordability and meeting our emissions reduction targets. It will be driven not by ideology like those opposite, but by ensuring that investment, whether it is in storage capabilities such as pumped hydro or in cleaner coal capabilities, meets our commitments to the world as well as our commitments to Australian consumers, households and businesses for affordable and reliable energy.</span>

We are committed to ensuring that Australia meets its emissions reductions targets—as Senator Brandis acknowledged earlier, our world-leading emissions reductions targets on a per capita basis. Australia has of course always done so. We have met our targets and exceeded them at every juncture. We will do so again with the 2020 targets, and we will ensure that we do so again with the 2030 targets. But we will be doing so with a firm eye as a government, as we always have, on how it is you do so while ensuring affordability and reliability. That is why our government will meet the 2020 targets without Labor's carbon tax, without that job-destroying carbon tax, which we removed, putting downward pressure on electricity prices, because we have implemented more cost-effective policies that deliver for the Australian people—</span>

I have just completed chairing a series of roundtables on behalf of the Minister for Agriculture, Barnaby Joyce, in Camperdown, the Kiewa Valley, Congupna and Gippsland. My question relates to the Australian dairy industry, which employs over 140,000 Australians, contributes $13 billion to our economy and is the No. 1 exporter off the Melbourne docks every day. What is the Turnbull government doing to support the dairy industry in my home state of Victoria?</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Queensland</span>—<span class="HPS-MinisterialTitles">Minister for Resources and Northern Australia</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">14:39</span>):  I thank the senator from Victoria for her question and recognise her longstanding support for our dairy industry and also the work she has done over the past couple of months to get out and about and listen to the dairy industry. Senator McKenzie has been hosting roundtables on behalf of the Deputy Prime Minister in rural Victoria over the past few months to listen to the industry and hear from them how they are responding to what has been very tough and a struggle for many farmers, given the low prices we have seen.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">It is important to listen, and Senator McKenzie has done that. But it is even more important that a government acts after listening to those concerns. Having spoken to Senator McKenzie after her roundtable, I know that she did hear from dairy farmers about how waiting times were too long to receive assistance through Centrelink and that sometimes the assets tests and how they were applied were not well suited to the farm sector—that they were more designed for non-farm individuals trying to access assistance. Because of that, the government has acted on those concerns. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">On 9 February last week an amendment bill was introduced into this parliament proposing that farm household allowance recipients not be required to serve waiting period before they commenced receiving payments. Furthermore, the bill proposes clarifying the treatments of certain assets, such as water assets, to ensure that these are recognised as an essential operation of a farm enterprise. This will mean that more dairy farmers will be able to receive assistance more quickly. It is a sign of a government that is acting on the real issues and concerns that face average Australians in the real world. We do rightly offer generous assistance to those farmers that find themselves in difficulty, but we also must recognise that sometimes that assistance does not flow on the ground. I congratulate and again recognise Senator McKenzie for her work in making sure that the decisions made here do flow through and help people out there in the real world.</span>

This package included $555 million of dairy recovery concessional loans, which provide loans at a rate of 2.47 per cent over 10 years—a very generous rate—to help dairy farmers get back on their feet. It involved providing $2 million for a milk commodity price index to improve transparency and predictability in the marketplace, and the government is also putting more resources into rural financial counselling. </span>

There are concerns about behaviour of processors and some retailers. There are remaining concerns about dollar-a-litre milk in the marketplace as well. That is why the government has announced an ACCC inquiry into the supply chain. At the same time as Senator McKenzie was conducting roundtables, the ACCC was conducting symposiums with the dairy sector to feed into that supply chain inquiry, and the government will be considering very carefully any recommendations that flow from that inquiry.</span>

These are all measures that are helping our dairy sector and making sure we have a strong farming sector in our country, and the government will remain committed to ensuring that occurs.</span>

The damning report of the Small Business and Family Enterprise Ombudsman, Kate Carnell, into the big banks found that they have been unacceptable and possibly unconscionable in their dealings with small businesses. Given that Ms Carnell, like thousands of Australians, is 'fed up' with the banks, when will the government admit that the banks will not change their ways, and establish a royal commission?</span>

We want practical outcomes which will address the very kinds of problems that not only Ms Carnell but also many other commentators and several inquiries have pointed to. Senator Gallagher, you seem to have, if I may say so, a very, very, very insouciant faith in royal commissions to change culture. We do not think that having a royal commission that will no doubt go on for years and which will no doubt cost hundreds of millions of dollars in lawyers' fees is the way to change the culture. Rather, what the Turnbull government announced last year is that it would bring the banks, through their CEOs, on a regular basis right before the House of Representatives Standing Committee on Economics and put them on the mat in that public forum regularly. That, in our view, is a much more effective way in which to change the culture to which you have pointed.</span>

The Turnbull government's comprehensive reforms of Australia's child care system will help the most hardworking Australian families to meet their bills. They will ensure that around one million Australian families benefit from comprehensive reforms restructuring child care services which will empower families to choose the days they work and the hours they work to suit their personal circumstances and, in doing so, to be able to do so without fearing about falling off a cliff in terms of their child care support.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Our estimates are that around 230,000 Australian families will increase their participation in the paid workforce because our child care changes will make the system fairer and more flexible for those who need it most. In particular, we will end the cliff that many families fall off midyear in terms of the child care support they receive. Around this time of year, many Australian families start to find they run out of subsidy under the $7½ thousand cap. Our changes for families earning less than $185,000 per annum will see that cap abolished completely. That will help around 90,000 families who hit that cap at present and of course empower many more to be able to choose to work more hours.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">We will better target support to those on the lowest incomes so that families earning less than $65,000 a year will see the weight of subsidy paid for child care going up from 72 per cent to 85 per cent—</span>

And to help Senator Collins, let me give the Senate a couple of examples. Let's take a single-parent family earning $50,000 a year, with one child in long day care for three days a week. That family, that single parent, will be around $2½ thousand a year better off net of the family tax benefit changes, net of the entire package. A hardworking family earning around $80,000, with both parents working and two children in long day care for three days a week, will be around $3,000 better off in net terms. Yet the Labor Party sits there and says that they will oppose, they will vote against, reforms that in totality will ensure that those hardworking Australian families who are juggling work and family responsibilities are going to be denied additional support because of the Labor Party's votes. But thankfully, hopefully, those on the crossbench will be more considerate, will help us to deliver for those hardworking families. <span style="font-style:italic;">(Time expired)</span></span>

They were going to put another tweak to the child care rebate cap, just lift that a little bit. Of course, the last time the Labor Party did that we saw that completely gobbled up through price rises in the child care sector. What we instead are proposing is to put in place an effective rate cap that will constrain future price rises and ensure that the additional support we give to hardworking Australian families will actually benefit those families, not simply flush through taxpayers hands and straight into the hands of child care operators instead.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">Labor have now talked—at the National Press Club the shadow minister spoke—of starting a national consultation about child care reform. Well, the coalition government has already done that. We had a comprehensive Productivity Commission inquiry that recommended the exact type of approach we are adopting. We have undertaken the regulatory impact statements. We have had multiple Senate inquiries. As Goodstart Early Learning has said, now is the time to act; now is the time to get these reforms passed and implemented. <span style="font-style:italic;">(Time expired)</span></span>

I refer to media revelations today of departmental advice to the government that the cause of blackouts in South Australia during last September's storm was indeed because of the storm and the damage. This advice showed that the Prime Minister and his ministers were told from the beginning that the power outage was not the fault of wind power. The Prime Minister and his government ignored that advice, opting to attack South Australia's renewable energy industry instead. The Prime Minister has now been caught lying. When will the Turnbull government stop lying to South Australians by falsely blaming renewables for our state's energy crisis and start being part of the solution?</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">

                    <span class="HPS-MemberAnswer">Senator BRANDIS</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Queensland</span>—<span class="HPS-MinisterialTitles">Attorney-General, Vice-President of the Executive Council and Leader of the Government in the Senate</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">14:56</span>):  Senator Hanson-Young, I think I really answered that question to your leader, Senator Di Natale, because he asked the same question. So, forgive me if I go over some of the territory that I covered in response to Senator Di Natale. First of all, it is absolutely false to say that the Prime Minister lied or misrepresented the position. The Prime Minister always acknowledged that the storm knocked out transmission lines. He acknowledged that. But he went on to observe, as is the case, that South Australia's over-reliance on intermittent energy and renewables created vulnerabilities in the system. And so it did. And let me read just a little of the report of AEMO, the Australian Energy Market Operator, into that event. This is what AEMO said:</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Small">The growing proportion of this type of generating plant within the generation portfolio is leading to more periods with low inertia and low available fault levels, hence a lower resilience to extreme events.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">That is what AEMO said, and that supports what the Prime Minister observed as a matter of common sense—that if you create vulnerabilities then, if there is an unpredictable event such as a storm, the system will have less resilience; it will have less capacity to respond to a black swan event like the storm that knocked the physical facilities in the South Australian network. That is what caused the problem, and there is no doubt that, as AEMO found, over-reliance on intermittent energy sources was a contributing factor.</span>

This has been an abject policy failure by Premier Weatherill and his ministers—an abject policy failure. A very important reason for it is that there is not enough resilience in the South Australian network. That is because there is not enough redundancy in the South Australian network so that when an event of the kind that we saw in South Australia occurs the network is unable to respond. It is unable to respond, and that is what you get, Senator Hanson-Young, when you favour ideology over science, as you do.

That is fact No.1. Fact No.2: the Turnbull government is committed to the most ambitious emissions targets per capita in the world, which we committed to at the Paris climate change conference. You can hardly impeach the Turnbull government for not implementing policies to encourage the renewable sector. But fact No.3: unlike you and unlike the Australian Labor Party, we take a technology-agnostic approach because we acknowledge that the most important obligation of all is for a government to preside over an energy policy that will keep the electricity generation network on stream and that will keep the lights on.

              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Small">That the Senate take note of the answers given by the Minister for Industry, Innovation and Science (Senator Sinodinos) and the Attorney-General (Senator Brandis) to questions without notice asked by Senators Wong and Sterle today relating to preference arrangements with Pauline Hanson's One Nation.</span>
              </p>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">Last week in this place I described the Prime Minister as:</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Small">… a man who has sold his soul for leadership. A Prime Minister so weak he’s only allowed to remain in the job for as long as he betrays virtually everything that he ever stood for. </span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">Now, with Malcolm Turnbull's capitulation to Senator Hanson, we can remove the word 'virtually' and confidently declare that this government is undeniably led by a man who has betrayed everything he has ever stood for. Last year in the middle of the election campaign, Mr Turnbull said of Pauline Hanson:</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Small">Pauline Hanson is, as far as we are concerned, not a welcome presence on the Australian political scene.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Now he boasts that he and his government will work very closely with One Nation Senators. He defends his Western Australian Liberal colleagues in doing a deal that not only preferences One Nation above Labor but against his own coalition colleagues, the Nationals.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I say to the National Party: I suppose you are experiencing what everybody who has dealt with Mr Turnbull is now finding out about him. That is, he stands for nothing but himself and he will junk any cause, any belief, any friend and even members of his own government if it stands in the way of Malcolm Turnbull's one and only interest, and that is Mr Malcolm Turnbull. This is the man who used to believe in marriage equality; this is the man who used to believe in the Australian republic; this is the man who said that he would never lead a party that was not as serious about climate change as he was. We now see him leading the charge against serious action on climate change. And now, today, the man who just nine months ago promised the Australian people, declared to the Australian people that Senator Pauline Hanson was 'not welcome' is now bending over to do deals with Pauline Hanson, even at the expense of his own coalition colleagues here in Canberra.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Senator Sinodinos defends this backflip because he insists that Senator Hanson and her party are now 'more sophisticated'. Well, you have to wonder whether this is yet another thing that Senator Sinodinos might not be able to recall in the future, because you would have to ask: what is more sophisticated? Is it Senator Hanson's plan to scrap the GST and replace it with a two per cent tax on everything including pensioners and the poor? Is it One Nation's plan to force everyone to sign a prenuptial agreement? Is it her plans to fingerprint everyone in the nation and then force them to provide their fingerprint before they can access Medicare? Maybe it is her belief that vaccines cause autism or that fluoridation amounts to the mass poisoning of the population. Maybe it is her plan to set up a patriotic broadcasting commission or her belief that Australians should be allowed to keep military style firearms in their homes or her admiration for President Putin. Or is it that she is now targeting Muslims instead of Asians?</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I thought it was very significant this morning when asked to provide evidence, an answer to the question as to where One Nation had become 'more sophisticated'—to use the words of Senator Sinodinos—the Prime Minister could not name a single policy, not a single one. Because the truth is, when it comes to One Nation, nothing has changed. Nothing has changed since another Liberal leader, with a lot more conviction and more principles than the current leader, declared in 1998 of the then member for Oxley and I quote Mr Howard: 'She is fanning racist sentiment. She is, I believe, appealing to racist sentiment.' And he went on to describe a speech she had given as 'not only an inaccurate, dishonest speech but it verges on the deranged in various places'. As Senator Hanson herself said, just last month, 'my policies have not changed over the years'. At least she is up-front. It is not One Nation who has changed; it is Malcolm Turnbull. He is so desperate to hang on to office he will trade any belief, any conviction and even his own colleagues if he thinks it will buy him a little time.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Today in question time, Senator Sinodinos told the truth. When asked why he believes that One Nation was 'more sophisticated', he said this: 'Let me begin by saying they are more sophisticated because in this chamber since they have been here they have supported important pieces of government legislation.' That is what it all comes down to. This is a government that is prepared to sell out on its principles to do what John Howard was not prepared to do, to trade with One Nation and Senator Hanson, because they are desperate to govern with them and they now believe they will not be re-elected without their support.</span>

                  </a>  I will come back to you, Senator Dastyari. And it is our obligation as senators to deal with all of the people that the Australian people send to this chamber. The Australian people decided that the government should not have a majority in the chamber. The Australian people decided that the opposition should not have a majority in the chamber so they gave the balance of power, as they more often than not do, to the crossbench. One of the largest elements of the crossbench is the One Nation Party. We are not doing our job if we do not respect the fact that the Australian people sent every one of the 76 of us into this chamber with the expectation that we would deal with each other, not that we would agree with each other, because there are many issues—I daresay most issues—in which I profoundly disagree with Senator Hanson. But, nevertheless, unlike Senator Wong, I do find it perfectly easy to treat her with professional courtesy. Unlike Senator Wong, who, in an unprecedented display of petulance, actually walked out and boycotted Senator Hanson's maiden speech.</span>

                  </a>  Dead right, she interjects. This chamber, ever since 1948, has been elected on a proportional representation franchise and that means, as we know, that it is a rare occasion that the government has a majority. So every government whether it be Labor or whether it be Liberal has an obligation, not out of anything other than respect for the Australian people, to deal with all elements of the crossbench and in doing so—unashamedly doing so—we do not say we agree with them. There are occasions on which the government last year accepted support from the Greens. We do not have any time for the Greens either but that does not mean to say that we do not respect our constitutional obligation to respect the wishes and the decision of the Australian people.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">
                  <a href="39801" type="MemberSpeech">
                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Senator CHISHOLM</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Queensland</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">15:16</span>):  What an extraordinary rant we just saw there from Senator Brandis. It goes to show that he misses the point of what this is all about. Once upon a time there were Liberals and Nationals in this chamber who were prepared to stand up and call Senator Hanson out when she was making racist and bigoted comments. That is not what we see from the Liberals and Nationals today. Instead we see the complete opposite. They are prepared to go out of their way to do deals and legitimise One Nation. We will absolutely stand up against them and highlight the damage that they will do to Australian society.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">What we have seen over the last 24 hours is an astonishing about-face from the Liberal Party in a concerted effort to justify their decision in Western Australia. It is pretty obvious that the key word from the Liberals has been 'sophisticated'. They have used that repeatedly in the media and they have also used it in this chamber today. They claim that One Nation is more sophisticated. Let's look back to 1998 when we were last dealing with One Nation. What did we see? We saw racism, cheap populism and demonising of minorities. We still see exactly the same today, only with some conspiracy theories added to the mix. Even the discredited two per cent 'Easytax' has made a comeback. This is what we are seeing from One Nation. The only thing that is more sophisticated is that they use Facebook Live to espouse these same views. Use of a social media platform does not make one more sophisticated, especially when those views belong deep in the dark ages of Australia.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">It is not One Nation that has changed; it is actually the modern Liberal Party. Senator Wong hit this nail right on the head. It is ironic that the leader of this effort to make a deal with One Nation has been Senator Sinodinos. Senator Wong correctly identified that he has at times had a dodgy memory. We are all well aware of this. Clearly he remembers none of the lessons from when he worked with former Prime Minister John Howard. John Howard was someone who was prepared to stand up and advocate that all Liberal parties—not only the national Liberal body but also all state Liberal parties—put One Nation last. That is what a leader of the Liberal Party did at the national level back in the nineties.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">But in question time Senator Sinodinos let the cat out of the bag. He was clear that his view of their being 'sophisticated' is based on One Nation's support of the government in the Senate. That is what the government are relying on. They are so desperate to keep their threadbare agenda going and to stave off leadership tensions inside the Liberal Party that they are willing to deal with anyone to keep the government afloat. Senator Brandis's performance was very, very mediocre. When you compare it to Liberal leaders of the past, his failure to condemn what the WA Liberal Party has done was a very, very poor effort.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Today we have also seen Nationals speak out about this deal, but they are not speaking out about the Liberals doing a deal with One Nation; all they are speaking out about is that they put One Nation ahead of the Nationals. Once upon a time you used to have giants of the National Party like Senator Ron Boswell, who was prepared to come in here and fight One Nation. Indeed in his farewell speech to the Senate this is something that Senator Boswell said:</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Small">In the fight of my life, against Pauline Hanson, I risked everything to stand up against her aggressive, narrow view of Australia. Defeating Pauline Hanson and One Nation in 2001 has been my greatest political achievement.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">What a sad bunch this current group of Nationals are in this chamber. They once had a giant of conservative politics in Queensland and in Australia whose defining legacy when he left the Senate was defeating One Nation, whereas all we see here from the current mob are people who are tripping over themselves to do a deal with One Nation and govern with their support.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Again, look at what John Howard said when he was asked about the Western Australian Liberals and whether they should put One Nation last in 1998: 'Yes, I think it was the right decision so you have a uniform, consistent position in the Liberal Party throughout Australia in both lower and upper houses.' He went on to say: 'Let's not deal with the periphery. The Liberal Party which I lead will put One Nation last.' <span style="font-style:italic;">(Time expired)</span></span>

                  </a>  You should know him, Senator Chisholm; you were a former state secretary in Queensland. He called up my staff on 25 January this year and wanted to do a grubby deal with us. Listen to this: Evan Moorhead wanted One Nation to run dead in all Queensland Labor seats and in return Labor would run dead in One Nation strongholds or in seats they had no chance of winning. So don't talk about grubby deals.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The fact is, I will not apologise for being a patriotic Australian—for standing up for Australian values and for the Australian people. So you can do your deals with the Greens, and all the rest of it, who want to see Australian coal destroyed, jobs destroyed and opening up for extremists in this country. Do your deals with them—that is absolutely wonderful! That is not what the people want. It was right when Senator Brandis said that 600,000 Australians voted for One Nation at the last election. Are you saying they all got it wrong? I don't think so.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">You should get out your tissues for the tears running down your cheeks, because you have not been able to do preference deals with us. The fact is, you have lost your way in this nation. Whether you have held government in the states or federally you have run this country into the ground. You have gone so socialist with your policies. You have the CFMEU, the unions, running you, so you have no control over your own destiny. People cannot rely on you at all, so don't talk to me about grubby deals.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I have worked hard and I have put my policies out there to the Australian people who voted for One Nation—not only myself, but two senators in Queensland, one in New South Wales and one in Western Australia. It was based on our policies—what the Australian people want.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The Labor Party has well and truly lost its way. I am not going to stand here and support the Liberal or National parties either, because I think they all have a lot to learn about what grassroots Australians really want. From the very beginning I said that when it came down to doing preferences in Western Australia I was going to do what I thought best for getting One Nation candidates elected to the floor of parliament, and that is exactly what I am doing.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I am not here to prop up the Colin Barnett government, and I am certainly not here to ensure that Mr McGowan is elected into the parliament either. That is a decision for the people. When they go to vote their preferences belong to them. The how-to-vote cards are only a recommendation. They belong to the voter. That is my message to the people. I will put myself out there with my candidates. We will put our policies up and the people will decide.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">You waste time in this chamber talking about this when we have over 200,000 homeless. I am fighting for the cane farmers up in Queensland who are about to go under—the cattle producers and everyone. And here you are in this chamber talking about One Nation and the preference deal in Western Australia. That is a state issue. It has nothing to do with matters federally. I really think it is pathetic. You should be absolutely ashamed of yourselves for the people watching this to think that you raised this as an issue. The people of Australia will be watching this and they know that I am out there fighting for them and their issues. If I say anything extreme they will judge me. But it is a shame that you have actually judged me because you are in fear of losing your seats to One Nation. I will put myself up against you any time—the Labor Party, the Liberals, the National Party or the Greens—based on my policies and how I fight for the Australian people.</span>

My issue is not with One Nation or with Senator Hanson. One thing that Senator Hanson has said is true: this is the same party that it was 20 years ago. They are the same policies and the same views. They have stayed true to what they said 20 years ago as an organisation. My issue is with a Liberal Party that will fundamentally change. Bill Shorten could not have been clearer about this: we will never do a preference deal—have not, will not, shall not and cannot. It is in our platform that we will not.</span>

                  </a>  I know that the Leader of the Government in the Senate has had some choice words in the past about the former Prime Minister. But on this issue the former Prime Minister was incredibly strong. Yes, it took Prime Minister Howard a while to come around, but when he did in 2001 he said, 'My view on one nation preferences is very clear. They should be placed last on every Liberal Party how-to-vote around the country.' He even went on to say, 'Flirting with One Nation will damage the Liberals.' But it is this notion that these extremist views are acceptable, that they are mainstream.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">My issue is not with them. They are entitled to those views, and they have been strong and consistent. What has changed? The only thing that has changed is that you have become desperate. The only thing that has changed is that you need them in this chamber. It's funny how none of the National Party senators are here defending it. The National Party in Western Australia has most definitely been thrown under a bus. National Party in Western Australia was the long-term coalition partner with the Liberals. We heard what Barnaby Joyce had to say this morning about all of this—they certainly were not the nicest of words. But to do that based on no principle! How is it okay that, 'We are being swamped by Asians,' has now been replaced by, 'We are being swamped by Muslims'? How does that make it acceptable? How does that make it okay? How does a party policy platform that has been consistent for 20 years and holds views that are abhorrent make it okay?</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">There was this notion that was being projected by Senator Sinodinos on the weekend, which I found despicable—the idea that it is because they have changed They have not changed. They will tell you they have not changed. They are the same party they have always been. And that is why since 1996, on every single how-to-vote, the Labor Party has seen to it that the One Nation party is placed with the other fringe bottom dwellers at the bottom of our how-to-vote ticket—every single one. We have been clear with them and they have been clear with us, because the ideological divide could not be greater. I respect them as individuals. I quite like some of them as individuals, but that does not mean that our policy agenda, their views and my views are alike.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Senator Brandis, I actually think you have had quite a respectable tenure, but if this is a Liberal Party that will go that far, to that extreme, I think you are going to look back on this period and it is not going to be a period of pride for the Liberal Party, just as in the Labor Party, when we look back on eras like the Calwell era, we look back with a sense of shame. Prior to the Whitlam resurrection, if you will, the Labor Party was founded with White Australia as our founding principle. It is not something we are proud of. We should acknowledge that. I believe this will be looked back on as the Labor Party looks back on that dark chapter of our own history.</span>

He sort of roughly echoed Mr Shorten's sentiments, which sadly have gone out the window insofar as Labor tactics today have gone. But on his program just this morning, he said, 'Just on politicians who tell us they understand, they get what we are banging on about when we say, "Guys, guys, you've lost touch; you're really not dealing with issues that affect people."' 'So what are they doing today?' he asks. 'They will go: "Yes, yes, yes, we will pay more attention. We'll get things right. It's all about you guys."' 'So what are they arguing about today?' he asks. He says, 'Today's big argument is preference deals, preference deals for the Western Australian election.' And he expresses nothing but disappointment in the fact that the political representatives from his home state are spending their time talking about this. And here we are today, using up the take note debate, to talk about this specific issue. So while power prices are spiking, as he says, the NBN switch is going to cost extra, fuels are up et cetera, he says, 'This is what opposition politicians are asking about: preference deals in Western Australia.'

                  <span class="HPS-Small">This Bill is in direct response to the decision of the Board and management of the Australian Broadcasting Corporation (ABC) to cease its shortwave transmission radio service to international audiences and to the Northern Territory on 31 January 2017.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">The purpose of this Bill is to require the Australian Broadcasting Corporation to restore its shortwave transmission services, following an announcement by the ABC in December 2016 that it would end its shortwave transmission service in the Northern Territory and to international audiences from 31 January 2017.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">The ABC's shortwave transmission service is the only option for many people who live, work and travel through rural and remote areas, including in the Northern Territory, South Australia, Western Australia and Queensland. It is a vital service for emergency broadcasts, news and weather. Shortwave transmissions are reliable, long-range and are not interrupted by adverse weather conditions unlike FM radio.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">The decision to cease the shortwave transmission service from the Northern Territory will mean ABC programs from Radio National and ABC local radio will no longer be available to those in vehicles and with portable radios from the remote parts of Australia referred to, including the top two thirds of South Australia. It will also significantly impact on our near neighbours in the region, where these broadcasts have been a reliable source of news and current affairs, including emergency information. Ceasing these broadcasts diminishes Australia's role in the region.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">For instance, shortwave radio played a valuable role in providing information to communities during the civil disturbance that occurred in East Timor in the lead up to independence.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">

                      <span class="HPS-MemberContinuation">Senator McGRATH:</span>
                    </a>  The Senate previously passed orders for the production of documents relating to the Perth Freight Link business case and the cost-benefit analysis, which was part of the business case on five occasions. In addition, on 12 November 2015, the Senate agreed to an order seeking the modelling and forecast of freight figures, as well as peer reviews undertaken of freight figures. That motion also implicitly relates to material relevant to the business case. The government has provided responses and some documents in response to those requests, which I now again table, together with those various previous orders of the Senate. I also table an answer to a question on notice provided by the Minister for Finance on 21 December 2016. These responses explain that the documents sought in the Senate's orders were either cabinet in confidence for the WA state government or contained information that is commercial and sensitive in nature, and their release in a full unredacted form would prejudice commercial negotiations and/or would potentially damage the relations between the Commonwealth and the WA government.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">
                    <span class="HPS-OfficeInterjecting" />These are public interest immunity grounds that have long been recognised by the Senate to justify the refusal to publicly release certain information and documents. In particular, it should be noted that the release of the documents could prejudice settling the contract for section 2 of the Perth Freight Link, which is not yet contracted. I would note that a summary of the business case was publicly released in December 2014 and further information on the project has been subsequently released by the WA government. The business case summary contains a substantial portion of key information from the business case. I also table that document again for the information of senators.</span>

Despite total school funding doubling in real terms from 1987-88 to 2011-12 and continuing to grow in real terms at 27.1 per cent, Australia's student performance in international literacy and numeracy tests has declined. That is why the coalition government is making sure its future school funding is needs based and is conditional upon practical, evidence based classroom reforms such as early literacy and numeracy assessments and phonics teaching that help improve student results.</span>

                  </a>  With respect to networks, the Australian Energy Regulator, in their benchmarking studies, have consistently found that privately owned networks are more efficient and productive than government owned ones. Regarding generation, at the time of the blackout wind was supplying around 2.5 per cent of demand. Had wind been producing at its capacity, it would have supplied over half of South Australia's electricity needs and there would have been around 1,400 megawatts of spare capacity. The other 97.5 per cent was being met by gas fired generation and brown coal from Victoria.</span>

What an indictment on the incredible work of Senator 'Wacka' Williams over such a long period of time. What an indictment on Barnaby Joyce, the national head of that party. What an indictment on the relationship between the Liberals and Nationals. This shows what they really think of each other—and that, clearly, is not very much at all.</span>

                  </a>  Leadership! What has changed is leadership. One Nation themselves will tell you they have not changed. Their policy agenda now is the same policy agenda they had them. Sure, it started off with bashing Indigenous Australians, then they were being swamped by Asians, and now, of course, that has been updated and upgraded to being about the Muslims—there are clearly too many of them. I say to my friends from the subcontinent: watch out; you are next! That has not changed. The racist policy agenda has not changed. The economic madness of a lot of what they suggest has not changed. What has changed is that we have a weak, pathetic Liberal Party leader who does not have the strength or stamina to actually stand up to anybody. We had the Prime Minister come out last week and say, 'I'll look billionaires in the eye; I am so tough,' and yet at every opportunity he folds; at every opportunity for leadership he collapses. It is weak. It is pathetic. It is not the type of leadership that this country needs. The policy agenda has not changed; the only thing that has changed is that we have a Prime Minister who is too weak to stand up to it.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">The Western Australian Liberal Party has effectively said: 'We will do anything we can to try to hold on at this point in time. Even if it means we will have an unworkable upper house, even if it means we are handing the balance of power to One Nation, none of that matters. Even if it means destroying a long-term coalition, none of that matters, because the act of attaining power is everything.' We have two obligations in this place. Of course we all want to win votes, but there has to be a red line somewhere. John Howard, Ron Boswell—the leaders of those opposite a generation ago—were people of principle who were prepared to stand up. On so many different policy areas you would not find me agreeing with Ron Boswell or former Prime Minister Howard, but where we would agree is that there are some fundamentals of Australian society, a core set of values we have in this country, that have to be protected, and we have to work together to achieve that. Legitimising extremist views is not a way of achieving that.</span>

                  <a href="250216" type="MemberSpeech">
                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Senator REYNOLDS</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Western Australia</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">16:33</span>):  I too rise to speak on this matter of public importance. There are two main points that I would like to discuss today. The first is the nature of the arrangements in Western Australia, about which there has been a lot of misinformation today; the second is the gross disrespect shown by my colleagues in this chamber to our One Nation colleagues. I think it is quite appalling. I will come back to that but first of all I will speak about preference arrangements in Western Australia.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We do things differently in Western Australia on many issues, and our relationship with the National Party is one of those different arrangements. In Western Australia we do not have a coalition; we have an alliance arrangement. The Liberal Party and National Party are not in coalition with each other in Western Australia, and that is because the Western Australian Nationals have preferred that arrangement to preserve their independence. It is quite unlike the coalition arrangements that we have in other states. My own view is that a strong and united coalition like we have at federal level, with direct preference flows between our respective candidates, is always preferable, but I respect the right of the WA Nationals to make their own arrangements with the WA Liberal Party organisation. Again, this is a direct state party to state party arrangement and has absolutely nothing to do with the Prime Minister or the federal Liberal Party.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Upper house voting tickets are officially registered with the Electoral Commission, so it is a matter of public record that, in practice, Brendon Grylls and the WA Nationals have preferenced other parties, including One Nation, ahead of the WA Liberal Party since the 2008 election. Following the 2008 election, both the WA Nats and WA Liberals preferenced other parties—the Shooters and Fishers, the Australian Christians party and Family First—ahead of each other. Finally, and I think very importantly, contrary to some other inaccurate stories earlier today, of course the WA Liberal Party will provide the preferences of our own candidates to the National Party in all the seats the WA Nationals are contesting. My understanding is that our arrangement with our alliance partners in Western Australia, the National Party, are actually no different from those at the last election—our arrangements with the National Party are actually the same.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">What I find particularly disturbing about the behaviour of those opposite on this topic is that they would use a state preference decision made by a state Liberal organisation to criticise the Prime Minister. Not only that but, as we heard in the chamber today at question time and just now from Senator Dastyari, they are using this opportunity to blatantly demonise three of their colleagues here in this place—three of their colleagues who were duly elected by nearly 600,000 Australian voters. Even if those opposite have no respect for their Senate colleagues, they should have respect for the 600,000 Australian voters who voted for them.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">It is the right of every Australian to have their voice heard in Australian politics and to vote in accordance with their own choice and their own free will. No matter how uncomfortable it may be for some in this place to hear it, it is incumbent on us all to respect alternative points of view. Every one of us in this chamber should know that as parliamentarians it is not our duty to condescend to and dismiss Australian voters or to tell them how to think. Instead, it is our duty to listen to the people who voted for and represented them. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We have seen time and time again in this place, and in the other place, that Labor does not respect the will of the people. They continue to block and frustrate the mandate of this government. They carp, they whine, they block and they say no, but they fail to offer any other solutions. Again today we have heard the Leader of the Opposition claim that he is above the fray. Unfortunately, I do not think that message got delivered to this place and to the Labor senators here today. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Those opposite are continually so afraid of public opinion and so committed to scoring political points that they blocked the plebiscite on same-sex marriage. Had you not done that, had you actually had the will to listen to the voices of Australian people, by next month gay couples in this country would have been able to get married. But you were so afraid of the debate and of listening to what Australian people had to say, you closed it down. You were so afraid and so intolerant of those opposite, of listening to other points of view—remember that shameful episode when Senator Hanson was delivering her first speech. All of us in this place are duly elected by Australian people and have the right to be heard by all of us in this place. But when the Greens walked out en masse in an absolutely cheap stunt, I do not believe I heard anybody in the Labor Party criticise the Greens for it. Everybody else paid due respect to Labor senators and to Greens senators for their first speeches. We might not agree with what you have to say, but we respected your right to say it and we listened to it. Again, that shows how disgracefully intolerant those on the other side of the chamber actually are. You are so full of your own opinions and your own self-righteousness that you cannot tolerate any other points of view. In fact the Greens walked out. They have such sensitive ears that they could not even sit here and listen to Senator Hanson give her first speech. That is a disgraceful situation for this democracy. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Unlike those opposite, we actually do respect the mandate and the people who voted for One Nation. The other thing we respect is that One Nation's policies are resonating not only with coalition voters but with Labor voters. And I think it is incumbent on all of us to listen to what those ordinary Australians are saying.  I might disagree with much of what they say, but that is actually irrelevant. We actually have the right to respect their party and respect the people who voted for them.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">Labor's sanctimony on preferences is yet another manifestation of their hypocrisy. Labor rallied against the policies and values of former senator Steve Fielding, when he was in this place; some of you here will remember that. But it was Labor who ensured his election by directing votes to him in a preference deal. Who here remembers what the Greens did at the last election? They voted in Clive Palmer's party and gave him preferences, ensuring that Clive Palmer's party actually got elected and got seats in this chamber. That was on the back of—guess what?—Greens preferences.</span>

If you had no pity for Senator Hanson after listening to her speak in response to your attack on her at question time, I do not know how you can possibly look at yourself in the mirror. You might not like what she has to say but she has the right to say it. Many Australians—even though I do not necessarily agree with a lot of what they say—we have the right to discuss it and to respect that. </span>

                  </a>  As I said, the WA Liberal agreement, as it has been reported, with One Nation is completely different from any other arrangement. It has nothing to do with the Prime Minister and it is absolutely nothing that the Liberal Party has not done before with the National Party in Western Australia. The fact that you are trying to drag up a situation with John Howard from over 20 years ago, I think, is really quite pathetic. With all of the other issues we have on our agenda here and the things in this place that we should be talking about—child care, national security, employment, education—you are sitting up and dragging three of your colleagues through the mud. You are condemning them for absolutely no reason. They were elected by over half a million people and they have a right to have their voices heard in this place. So, if you are going to be true to your word that we should not in Western Australia do a deal with the National Party or with One Nation or with the shooters and fishers or any other party, have a look at your own preference records; you are completely hypocritical on this, as are the Greens. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The Greens are the party that got Clive Palmer elected with their preference deals. So what are you going to do? Are you going to keep doing preference deals with the Greens? What is the difference? You are completely and utterly hypocritical. This sort of sanctimony and game playing is why the Turnbull government acted to put the powers of preferences federally firmly in the hands of voters with our Senate reforms last year. We believe that voters should choose where their preferences go. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Finally, what also disturbs me is that not only are you going back to 20 years ago, to a completely different political environment, but you clearly do not understand the difference between state and federal election arrangements, because this is a WA state party arrangement with a party that has every right to campaign, exist and seek government in Western Australia. Just because we respect the voters and what the voters are telling us does not mean we have to agree with their point of view.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I want to put on the record how disgraceful I thought Labor's performances were here today. It was wrong for them to attack three of their Senate colleagues on the basis that they have no right to go into negotiations or to deal with any other political parties, and it was wrong that Senator Hanson had to come here to justify her humanity and her existence. Instead of playing the person, instead of vilifying them, why don't you start playing the politics and start coming in here and debating the issues? Come in here and debate the issues they and we are raising, rather than just attacking individuals in the Senate. It is demeaning, and I think it is beneath us all. <span style="font-style:italic;">(Time expired)</span></span>

That is what it is about. Senator Reynolds commented that it is a WA issue, so perhaps Senator Sinodinos should not have made the comments that he made yesterday about One Nation being more sophisticated and evolved. Let me read you a couple of the comments from the 'sophisticated and evolved' candidate for One Nation in the Pilbara in Western Australia. On the comment that Tony Abbott made about lifestyle choices, Mr Archibald wrote:</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">Maybe that is why Senator Sinodinos was commenting about their evolution as a party. He went on:</span>
              </p>

                <span class="HPS-Small">This will result in a rapid rise in the portion of the population that is lazy and ugly. We know what causes pregnancy these days, so everyone who gets pregnant outside of marriage is a volunteer. This is an easy one for defunding.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">Mr Archibald also used the article to suggest defunding the disability support pension and child care. He said:</span>

                <span class="HPS-Small">The 800,000 Australians on the disability pension. OK, not all of them. But a good proportion are able to drive cars, bash police and each other, go fishing and so on.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">He also then went on to have a go at federally-funded child care. He said:</span>

                <span class="HPS-Small">This is a lifestyle choice. Looking after children is very labour-intensive … If society wishes to encourage childbearing, it should reward that with tax rebates to the childbearing pair and leave it at that.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Tasmania</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">16:48</span>):  Rarely do I come into this chamber expecting to have a lecture from someone like Senator Reynolds. I am used to it from Senator Brandis—we can even have a bit of banter about it between us. But for Senator Reynolds to jump up and spend a good 10 minutes of her speech so sanctimoniously telling us what we do wrong on this side and how everyone should be more tolerant is just beyond belief. I would like to reiterate everything Senator Siewert said. I was going to mention some of that, but I will not go over that as well. Senator Reynolds obviously did not watch <span style="font-style:italic;">Insiders</span> yesterday and did not see Senator Sinodinos talk about how sophisticated One Nation have become. I will leave that at that.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Rarely do we get senators on this side of the chamber standing up to defend the words of former Prime Minister Howard. We heard Senator Dastyari do that, and I am also going to, because one of the few wise things Mr Howard said was that One Nation should be placed last on every Liberal Party how-to-vote card around Australia. We know that some people on that side, including Senator Brandis, are not that keen on Mr Howard—Senator Brandis famously referred to him as, shall I say, an unflattering member of the animal kingdom—but even Mr Howard did not stoop as low as the level that we have seen in Western Australia, that I think we will probably see in Queensland and that I will be very surprised if we do not see nationally. It is a sad day when the Liberal Party show such poor leadership that they cannot even listen to a piece of advice from one of their elder statesman.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Last week I made a contribution to the debate about the lack of leadership within the Liberal Party. With this recent announcement from Mr Barnett and the Liberals, perhaps I made my contribution to that debate a little bit too early. I do not think those who hold the government benches both in Western Australia and in this parliament could show worse leadership than in that decision. Mr Turnbull does not have the leadership to actually stand up and say he will not deal with One Nation, and Senator Sinodinos would not actually say yes or no on <span style="font-style:italic;">Insiders</span>, but this is what I reckon: they will do a national deal with One Nation and they will do over their National Party colleagues. I think we are seeing the extraordinary weakness of Malcolm Turnbull once again. He is beholden to the right wing of the Liberal Party and this is just another example of his weakness showing through.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">Only Labor has shown leadership on this issue. We will not be cosying up to One Nation nationally, in Western Australia, in Queensland or wherever it may be. Labor will not make those deals. The Liberal Party leadership has become so feeble that a member of the Queensland parliament elected for the LNP has defected to One Nation. We have to remember that, after 10 years as an LNP MP, Mr Steve Dickson, the member for Buderim on the Sunshine Coast, has left the LNP and joined One Nation. Obviously this is for political gain. In fact, I am sure the whole deal is just for political gain; it is for power at the expense of some of your own colleagues. Who cares as long as they can get and hold power? That is what it is all about. I do not see those on the Nationals side in this chamber jumping up and down, being happy about it and thinking that it cannot happen to them. I think they have probably worked out that pretty soon the same thing might be happening to them.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Despite being in a coalition with the National Party for decades, the Liberals have chosen to preference One Nation even over their national coalition partners. That is the gist the whole debate. Murdoch University political lecturer Ian Cook said that 'the Liberals' jumping into bed with One Nation could backfire and jettison the party out of power. He further said, ' For the Liberals, it looks like a desperate move to hold onto power at any cost. I'd be surprised if it worked.' The Deputy Prime Minister, Mr Joyce, from the other place, is warning of an all-out brawl, so we know they are not happy. Mr Joyce described the outcome as 'a disappointing move'. He said he hoped its architects 'clearly understand the ramifications of the decision'. He raised the prospect of retaliation against the move by the Nationals: 'The Nationals could stand in every lower house seat in Perth and preference another party. What would that mean?' <span style="font-style:italic;">(Time expired)</span></span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Western Australia</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">16:53</span>):  Oh, what a tangled web we weave when first we practise to deceive—reference Wong, Senator P, 13 February 2017,  Senate of the Australian parliament. What confected outrage did we hear from Senator Wong and Senator Chisholm from Queensland in terms of apparent deals for preferences. But wasn't Senator Chisholm cut down instantly by none other than the architect of all this—Senator Hanson herself. Let me quote from only a few minutes ago in this place. This is Senator Hanson responding to the outrage of Senator Chisholm: 'Thank you very much. Well, isn't it amazing what comes across this chamber? You must be really worried about One Nation.' </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The whole fact is that Labor has approached One Nation for preferences. Oh, but you do not want to talk about that one. 'How about Evan Moorhead, the Queensland state secretary?' she said to Senator Chisholm. 'You're a former state secretary. Well, he actually called up my staff on 25 January this year and he wanted to do a grubby deal with us.' What a web we weave in this place. So it has come home to roost, has it not—all the confected outrage from Senator Wong and Senator Chisholm, and all we see of course is the hypocrisy, which has been exposed so brilliantly by Senator Hanson. When I say 'hypocrisy', do I think back to some of the preference deals that have been done in her own home state of South Australia—the deal done between the state Labor government of then Premier Wran—</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">I then go to the deal between the Labor Party and the National Party which caused Minister Karlene Maywald, the then member for Chaffey, to be in the Labor ministry from 2004 to 2010. We know of the deal done between Labor and the Greens political party in Tasmania. In fact, the Senate has two previous members of that ministry, in Senator Singh and Senator McKim, under the premiership of David Bartlett. So bad a government was it, of course, that it delivered government to Mr Will Hodgman. Then of course we know of the deal done between Labor and the Greens to deliver government for Ms Gillard 2010. So let us not worry too much about the confected hypocrisy of the Labor Party in this particular position. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">What it has done, through you, Acting Deputy President, to Minister Payne, is to give a very good understanding of how things are run in the Labor Party. I know, from when I was there last—I have not been for some period of time—that it is the Western Australian division, the lay party itself, the executive, that makes the decision.  As we know from out of the mouth Senator Wong today, if the Labor Party nationally were a horse, you would say it were owned, trained and ridden by the CFMEU. Of course, the poor victim of it is Mr Shorten. We know that Mr Shorten, in his turn as the puppet of the CFMEU, directs the Labor Party in Western Australia. So we know how it happens in WA. Well, it does not happen like that in the Liberal Party in Western Australia. It is done of course by the state executive. The second point to be made so strongly is the fact that, as Senator Reynolds said, in Western Australia the relationship between the National Party and the Liberal Party is not a coalition; it is an alliance. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I go back to the election of 2008, which was a cliffhanger and nobody could form government. So what did Mr Grylls, the now member for the Pilbara, as the leader of the party do? Senator Reynolds knows. He entertained the possibility of forming government with the Labor Premier, Mr Carpenter. We know of course, because they are friends of mine, that 'Tuck' Waldron in Wagin, Max Trenorden in Northam, Grant Woodhams in Moore, Phil Gardiner in the midwest and Terry Redman down in Denmark all said, 'We couldn't walk down the main street of our towns.' They said to the leader, Brendon, 'If you decide to join forces with Mr Carpenter, we will cross over and we will form government with Liberal Party.' So do not be too concerned about all these things. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We then go forward to 2010, when the National Party stood a candidate against a sitting member, Mr Tuckey. That led to Mr Tony Crook not coming to Canberra to represent the National Party at all; he sat as an Independent for two years. He never ever sat in the coalition party room. He did sit with the National Party for a while. He never sat with the coalition. So we are talking about that excellent relationship that you have up and down the east coast of Australia. We have not been a party in coalition. If time permits, I will get back to the nonsense of the grubby production deal, the slug, that Mr Grylls is trying to do to rump out our two major iron ore producers—again, not consistent with the policy of the government.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">In 2013, when, indeed, in a landslide the people of Western Australia quite rightly returned the Barnett government, Mr Barnett could have governed in his own right, but, being the statesman that is, he said, 'No, we have had this alliance with the National Party—I will continue to include the National Party in the ministry.' So that is the standard of excellence of this man. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Let us then turn to what the actual arrangements are in Western Australia. Let me make these points very, very clearly. The first point is that the Liberal Party will preference the Nationals first in every lower house seat in which the National Party is running but have promised that the One Nation party will not be placed last. So with all of this outrage and nonsense that has been going on, we have the simple fact of the matter that, in those non-metropolitan seats in which the National Party is putting up candidates, the Liberal Party will preference them first.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The second point that must be borne in mind is that of history. For those who choose to ignore it, they are bound to repeat it. Let me tell you what did happen in 2008. In the 2008 election, when I was a candidate myself in the state election for Western Australia for the seat of Alfred Cove, the National Party in all rural upper house regions had preferenced the Christian democrats, Family First and One Nation ahead of the Liberal Party. Where was all this confected outrage then? In 2013 both of our parties—the Nationals and the Liberals—preferenced the Christian democrats, Family First and the Shooters, Fishers and Farmers Party ahead of each other.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">There is nothing unusual about all of this, but what have we done so that of course we can contest this election and hopefully keep out an underperforming what is now opposition led by Mr McGowan and the recycled Ms Alannah MacTiernan if she gets another go? It is critically important that— <span style="font-style:italic;">(Time expired)</span></span>

He has reminded us of the seething hypocrisy of the Labor Party coming in here and lecturing the Liberal Party about having done a deal with One Nation when actually they were playing footsie with One Nation until somebody, whether on the west coast or the east coast, told them to cease and desist. But, the fact is, who was in the frame today? The Liberal Party of Western Australia—the desperate Premier Colin Barnett, who has thrown his Nationals colleagues under the bus not for the first time, as Senator Back has said, but probably the most consequential time because this could deliver balance of power in the Western Australian Legislative Council—the upper house—to One Nation.</span>

No, Senator Sinodinos, you are. It is not the One Nation party that has evolved—the Liberal Party has devolved. The standing and morals it had have evaporated.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">Mr Barnett has, for eight years, led a completely pointless government. The only achievement that they have to point to after eight years is coming out of the greatest commodity boom in the state's history $40 billion in debt. They have nothing to show for it. They are an empty government with no plan for the next four years for Western Australia and so they have cut this slimy deal with One Nation, a splinter party that has generated support across Australia by promoting race hate and white supremacy—the kind of white nationalism that has now reached such dangerous threshold levels in the United States and elsewhere. Premier Barnett is playing with fire in doing this deal. If it was a government worth saving maybe you would sort of understand the fact that they would cut some slimy preference deals, but this is a government not worth saving.</span>

Thirty per cent of Liberal voters said they would be less likely. They will regret this deal. <span style="font-style:italic;">(Time expired)</span></span>

                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Senator McALLISTER</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">New South Wales</span>—<span class="HPS-MinisterialTitles">Deputy Opposition Whip in the Senate</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">17:04</span>):  There has been some discussion today about the return of One Nation as a force in Australian politics. I think at the start of this debate we ought to be very clear where responsibility for this return lies, because it is true that One Nation is receiving some level of support in some parts of Australia. The real responsibility for the return of One Nation as a political force lies with the Liberal-National coalition and with the Greens. It lies in the events at the end of the last session when a deal was put into this chamber to ram through legislation to achieve Senate voting reform, as was referred to by Senator Reynolds in her speech, that ultimately delivered One Nation back to this chamber with three at the moment but ultimately four senators. So we now have four One Nation senators eligible to sit in this chamber from a pre-election position of absolutely none.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Now to respond to that, do we see the Liberal-Nationals pushing back on this? No, we do not. What we see is an attempt to actually consolidate their position and assist One Nation in holding this foothold within Australian politics. I will say this to Senator Reynolds, who urged us to respect the voting system, the process of democracy and the outcome of the election: I do respect the political process. I absolutely respect what voters have said, and I respect the things that they say are important to them, but that does not mean that I or anyone else in this chamber ought to assist One Nation by delivering them political preferences in state elections. Respect is just not the same thing as this. Respect, incidentally, does not mean adopting the world view that One Nation advocates and advocating for this in this chamber. Respect is not the same as sitting passively by while One Nation reviles whole sections of the Australian community. And respect is certainly not the same as sitting by passively while we see a state branch of the Liberal Party delivering preferences to One Nation.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">What I will say, because it has been brought up already in the debate, is that there has been a false report about the behaviour of the Queensland Labor Party. Evan Moorehead, who is the secretary of Queensland Labor, has gone on the record this afternoon saying that those reports are absolute nonsense. He said to the <span style="font-style:italic;">Guardian</span>:</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Small">Ashby rang me looking for preference discussions and I said no. I said the issue is that in a lot of the places that they’re talking about, the two-candidate preferred battle will be between One Nation and the Libs. And we’ve always had a position on putting One Nation last.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">So, let's hear no more of that story. That is the position that the Queensland secretary has put on the record this afternoon.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">It is the position, of course, that should have been taken by the Prime Minister, Mr Turnbull. Last year, Mr Turnbull said that Pauline Hanson was 'not a welcome presence' on the Australian political scene, but we do not hear any more of this now, do we? In January this year he ducked it, saying that preference deals with One Nation are a matter for the state branch and for the premier. Well, it is a shame he does not have the courage to express now the position he held such a short time ago. Even Barnaby Joyce is willing to put a more principled position on the table, saying:</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Small">It seems a bit desperate I've got to say and when you go and make friends with people who don't share the same values of you, it makes it very hard to form a government.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The defence, of course, put by Senator Sinodinos is that these guys are 'more sophisticated' now than they were before.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Well, is it sophisticated to express admiration for Vladimir Putin, saying, 'I like him as a person; he's a strong leader'? I do not think that is sophisticated; I think that is appalling, when six New South Wales residents in the state I represent were among the 298 people who died when a surface-to-air missile hit MH17 in 2014. Is it sophisticated to say that multiculturalism has failed? Is it sophisticated to run candidates who describe single mothers as 'too lazy to attract and hold a mate'? None of this is sophisticated. None of this represents the best traditions of Australian politics.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Labor has never preferenced One Nation. We will never make deals with people who espouse xenophobic and sexist views. Australia's major political parties once shared a broad compact, and that was respect and empathy for all people, regardless of their cultural background, regardless of their religion. And this Liberal deal undermines those values and the very principles of equality that build the best of Australia. <span style="font-style:italic;">(Time expired)</span></span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Queensland</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">17:09</span>):  On 25 January this year Evan Moorehead, the state secretary of the Labor Party in Queensland, speaks with a One Nation official: 'Hey, mate, here's the deal: One Nation's to run dead in Queensland Labor seats and in return Labor'—that very principled party—'will run dead in One Nation strongholds or seats where the ALP has no chance of winning'. Now, this is the team who has the hide to come into this parliament and blame the coalition for doing deals with One Nation. When it comes to the question of whether you believe Mr Moorehead—who I confess I do not know—or Senator Hanson, I will go with Senator Hanson all the time. You may not agree with what she says, but you always know that she speaks her mind and she speaks it truthfully.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We have just heard from Senator McAllister a third-hand assurance by the Queensland Labor Party—that principled group up there in Queensland—that they are going to put One Nation last. Okay, I do not believe it, but the proof is always in the pudding. But as anyone in this chamber knows, the Labor Party in Queensland and elsewhere does not run the campaign. The campaign is run by the CFMEU, the CPSU and all of the other unions who run around Queensland saying, 'Put the LNP last.' I will repeat that. This is the Labor Party's main campaign arm—the unions—running around Queensland saying, 'Put the LNP last.' Now, how does that coincide, how does that gel, with what we have just heard—that the Labor Party is going to put One Nation last?</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">It just shows the abject inability of the Labor Party to tell the truth, to have any semblance of honesty and forthrightness. If there are Labor Party Queensland speakers to speak in this debate today, I challenge them to say here and now that not only will the Labor Party put One Nation last but that our minders—the people who run us, the people who provide all of our money, the people who provide all of the thugs on the polling booths—will also put One Nation last. And I will bet that there is not a Labor person here who is prepared to say that, because Labor is controlled by the unions. They run the campaign. They know that they will run around at the next Queensland election with a slogan of putting the LNP last. And you can judge from that the absolute hypocrisy of the Labor Party in Queensland. <span style="font-style:italic;">(Time expired)</span></span>

I also do not blame her for cracking the best deal she could do in WA, and I think she will definitely get three seats in the upper house. She may even get six, or even more. And Hinch's hunch—I am often wrong—is that this deal will put the Labor Party into government in the lower house in WA.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">Now, 'more sophisticated': as I said on <span style="font-style:italic;">Sunrise </span>this morning, with Senator Hanson, I do not think it is sophisticated when 20 years ago your main kick was that you had been swamped with Asians and now your main platform is that you are being swamped with Muslims. But my fight is not with One Nation here. My fight is with the Liberal Party, who have thrown the Nationals under the bus. We heard Senator Back saying how wonderful it is, the agreement with the Nationals, and how they would support them elsewhere et cetera. On this occasion, they have thrown them under the bus, and I think it will come back to bite them. Senator Ludlam's time ran out before he quoted all of that poll that said that if people were asked, 'If your party were to vote for One Nation, would that make you less inclined or more inclined to vote?' On the Liberal poll—I saw the same poll—it was, as he said, 30 per cent of Liberals who said they would consider changing their vote, and I think it was actually 50 per cent of Nationals. That is why I say here on this occasion it is so cynical that you had the Prime Minister there virtually saying, 'It is a state matter, and it shouldn't be for us to justify it.' But you had Arthur Sinodinos at the weekend offering a great apologia about how wonderful One Nation is now and how they can lie in bed with them. As old Joh Bjelke-Petersen said: 'You lie down with dogs and you get up with fleas.' I think they will find out that is the situation in WA. I do not even need the whole 2½ minutes.</span>

                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Senator PRATT</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Western Australia</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">17:14</span>):  It is of no surprise to me that the Barnett government has done this dirty preference deal with One Nation in Western Australia. It is exactly what it appears to be—a sneaky and desperate act from the state Liberal Party. It shows very clearly that the Liberal Barnett government is tired and out of touch and it will do absolutely anything it can to stay in power. It is a deal hammered out behind closed doors in secret. It seems that Premier Barnett is so worried about losing government and so worried about his own failings as premier that he knows the only chance he has of staying in power is doing this deal with One Nation. It is not a deal that is in the best interests of Western Australia. It is simply about getting Premier Colin Barnett re-elected at any cost.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Make no mistake: if this deal goes ahead, a vote for One Nation in Western Australia would be a vote for the Liberal Party, if people follow their how-to-vote cards. A vote for One Nation is a vote for the same old tired policies of this very tired government. A vote for One Nation in Western Australia would be a vote to privatise Western Power. Prime Minister Howard made a promise to the Australian people that One Nation should be placed last on every Liberal Party how-to-vote card around the country, and the Liberal Party should continue to uphold his promise to the Australian people.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Prime Minister Turnbull should be condemned if he fails to uphold the same promise. Prime Minister Turnbull should stand up against Colin Barnett and this dirty deal. Is it perhaps something that Prime Minister Turnbull will do too? The Prime Minister's failure to rule out a deal with One Nation demonstrates what he is prepared to do to cling to power amidst the chaos of his own government. As we know, Prime Minister Howard would not preference One Nation and Labor will not preference One Nation, but Colin Barnett will. So today I ask: will Prime Minister Turnbull rule it out? Will Prime Minister Turnbull do a preference deal with One Nation? I ask him where his integrity is on that matter.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Our colleague Senator Sinodinos has said that One Nation has changed in the last 20 years, but how has it changed? Has it changed from discriminating against Asians to discriminating against Muslims? Is that the kind of change Senator Sinodinos is referring to? As we all know, Senator Hanson used her maiden speech in this place last year to call for a ban on Muslim immigration. It is a party that supports divisive policy, and there are many examples—Senator Wong referred to some in question time today. Is this something that the Liberal Party supports? It certainly seems that way in Western Australia. What is really true here is that the Liberal Party has changed, and Senator Hanson has not changed. Her policies have remained entirely consistent. What is really true is that the Liberal Party has changed and this is not the party of John Howard anymore. And so we have this insidious deal before us. It is time for Barnaby Joyce to come out and say whether he agrees with the WA Liberals to put One Nation above the nationals in WA. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Let's be clear about this: supporters of all parties should be able to make up their own minds about who they vote for and who they preference. Voters should make their own decisions when they are at the ballot box, and any government must work with whoever is elected. So it is disappointing to me that the Liberal government in WA would do this sneaky deal behind closed doors. With the double dissolution election last year, One Nation now holds seats in this place just, as it held the balance of power in the upper house when Labor was last in power in WA. In 2001 One Nation surged in the state poll, and both Labor and Liberal put One Nation last. What we saw was the election of a number of One Nation MPs—MPs whose time in One Nation did not last very long because they defected and left the party. All this illustrates is the ongoing dysfunction and chaos—<span style="font-style:italic;">(Time expired)</span></span>

It was Labor's slippery suggestion to meet and discuss Western Australian preferences to us through the Mineral Council. They wanted to have an underhanded meeting with us through the Mineral Council because they did not want to approach us directly. He actually said to my staffer: 'This is going to be off the record. If ever it is raised and I am asked the question "Are we going to do preference deals?", I am going to say, " No".' My staffer said in return, 'Well, we don't play those sorts of games.

After I was chased and hounded and criminal charges were laid against me, Peter Beattie changed the laws in Queensland just prior to my trial to make the jail term seven years retrospectively instead of six months. You have bent over backwards to try and get rid of me all these years because you never wanted to see One Nation in here. You knew the support that we were getting then and you know the support that we are still getting in this country right across the board—the polls are showing it—and you are terrified of it. Yes, we are a threat to you and it is about time because people want a change. They are sick and tired of it. You have a go at me and my policies about multiculturalism. We are multiracial, but, at the end of the day, we should all be treated the same equally under the one law. We are Australians.

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">
                  <a href="39801" type="MemberSpeech">
                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Senator CHISHOLM</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Queensland</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">17:22</span>):  Now let's be absolutely clear. The key issue that has gone on in this debate is the lack of speakers from the Nationals. Not one of the Nationals has come in and talked about this issue. Imagine if this was 20 years ago. Ronnie Boswell would have come bustling through those doors and he would have been the first one to speak about this, condemning One Nation and leading the charge for the Nationals in Australia to put One Nation last. Instead, we see a poor imitation representing the Nationals in the Senate chamber today. In Queensland, Senator Hanson had another go there. Let's be absolutely crystal clear. The current state secretary, Evan Moorhead, has put out a statement saying it was absolute nonsense. That was the statement from the former secretary. As his predecessor, I am sure he has got big shoes to fill but he has now put out a statement denying that any discussion like that took place.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">What we have seen in this chamber on this Matter of Public Importance is a good effort by the Liberals to avoid speaking about the key point—that is, the federal Liberals, led by John Howard, took the principled position to put One Nation last and they advocated that across all their state and federal branches. That was what the leader John Howard did when he was Prime Minister. What we now see is a decision by the Western Australian Liberals to do a deal with One Nation. We have seen nothing similar from the federal Liberals in the House of Reps or in the Senate. That is how far this discussion has come. The Nationals are just a poor imitation of what we saw all those years ago.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Let's compare the debate inside the coalition compared to where they were 20 years ago. Twenty years ago, they debated whether to put One Nation last with the eventual decision that they would. Whereas now we have the current day Liberal Party arguing not about whether they would be placed last but whether they would be placed ahead of the Nationals. The emerging issue from this decision by the Western Australian Liberals is the leadership tension that is on display within the Liberals and the Nationals.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">One of the first people to come out and talk about this was the former Prime Minister, the member for Warringah, Tony Abbott. He said that the Nationals should always be above One Nation in Liberal preferences—just to ingratiate himself with the Nationals in any forthcoming leadership dramas. But what we have seen from the federal Liberals has been a really disappointing effort today.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Queensland in particular should know better. We are really proud within the Queensland Labor Party of the stance that we took on One Nation. Senator Hanson mentioned Peter Beattie. He was the first one to say as a matter of principle that One Nation would be last on our how-to-vote cards. That led to him becoming Premier in 1998 and it was a stance that he maintained while he was there. Queensland Labor has always maintained that view. Indeed, at the recent state conference held on the Gold Coast last year, I moved a motion that One Nation be placed last on all how-to-vote cards at the upcoming state election. That was some months ago. That is something we stick to now and that is something that is an article of faith for the Labor Party in Queensland. We are proud of our role in defeating One Nation in Queensland and we will double our efforts at the state and federal elections in the coming months.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">But when you do a deal like the One Nation Party and the Liberals have, you have to own it. That is the problem for Senator Hanson; she has not owned it. What that means is that they are helping to re-elect the Barnett government. What are the consequences of that? The consequences will be more debt—I am sure Senator Roberts would be greatly concerned about that—and the privatisation of the electricity assets in Western Australia. The deal that One Nation has done will make it more likely that those things will occur. That is actually what that means. And we will see similar result as this relationship develops at the federal election. We are already seeing harsher industrial relations laws. We are already seeing support for more cuts to welfare and we are seeing attacks on the social safety net including Medicare. This is what we are seeing when One Nation and the LNP vote together.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The reality is that when it comes to the Liberal Party, this is a poor imitation compared to 20 years ago led by a Prime Minister who is just a shell with no policy beliefs. He is a leader who is willing to trash his own brand to cling to power. <span style="font-style:italic;">(Time expired)</span></span>

                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">The Government has no greater responsibility than keeping Australia safe and secure. As a result, we have committed to strengthening Australia's aviation and maritime infrastructure against serious or organised crime. We will strengthen background checking regimes, to ensure that individuals who pose a security risk or have links to serious or organised crime cannot gain access to the security-sensitive areas of our airports and ports. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">The <span style="font-style:italic;">Transport Security Amendment (Serious or Organised Crime) Bill 2016</span>, will address these issues and will ensure we keep illegal guns off our streets and our communities safe.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">This Bill was previously introduced into the House of Representatives on 11 February 2016. It passed the House on 16 March 2016, but lapsed at prorogation on 17 April 2016.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">Following referral to the Senate Rural and Regional Affairs and Transport Legislation Committee in the last Parliament, the Bill was recommended to progress to the Senate without amendment. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">The Australian Criminal Intelligence Commission has determined that organised crime groups are a threat to the Australian way of life, and estimate that organised crime costs the Australian economy $36 billion annually. In 2015, the Government committed to a comprehensive package of action to tackle the growing problem in our communities of the crystalline form of methamphetamine (commonly known as the drug 'ice'). The National Ice Taskforce, in its final report released late 2015, estimated that there are currently well over 200,000 Australian users of the drug. This is a significant increase compared to the reported less than 100,000 users in 2007.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">As a key priority, the National Ice Taskforce identified the need for targeted and coordinated law enforcement efforts to disrupt the supply of ice. Of note, was the recommendation that we harden the aviation and maritime environments against organised crime by strengthening the eligibility criteria for the aviation and maritime security identification card schemes (also known as the ASIC and MSIC schemes). This recommendation echoes those from several independent inquiries. These inquiries identified that the inadequacy of our aviation and maritime security measures to combat serious or organised crime, is an increasing risk to our communities.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">The Bill introduces the additional purpose to the <span style="font-style:italic;">Aviation Transport Security Act 2004</span> and the <span style="font-style:italic;">Maritime Transport and Offshore Facilities Security Act 2003 </span>(as I will now refer to as the Aviation and Maritime Acts) of combating serious or organised crime at our airports and ports. The additional purpose will apply solely to the ASIC and MSIC schemes, adding to their current purpose of safeguarding against unlawful acts of interference with our aviation and maritime infrastructure.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">The ASIC and MSIC schemes are an important part of securing the aviation, maritime and offshore oil and gas sectors. Under the schemes, any person with an operational need to remain unmonitored in security-sensitive areas at Australia's airports, ports, Australian flagged ships and offshore facilities, must hold a valid ASIC or MSIC confirming they have passed a background check.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">The primary purpose of the background check is to establish whether an applicant poses a security threat to aviation and maritime infrastructure. However, this check does not currently consider whether the individual poses a serious criminal risk within the security-sensitive areas of our transport infrastructure. This Bill will correct this by establishing the regulatory framework for introducing new eligibility criteria, which will be harmonised across both the ASIC and MSIC schemes.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">The eligibility criteria under each scheme currently refer to a range of offences relevant to unlawful interference with aviation and maritime infrastructure as per the purpose of the existing Aviation and Maritime Acts. The criteria do not include offences arising from serious criminal activity, such as anti-gang or criminal organisation legislation, illegal sale and possession of firearms and other weapons, illegal importation of goods, or interfering with goods under Australian Border Force control. These will be included in the new harmonised eligibility criteria. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">Under current eligibility criteria, an ASIC or MSIC applicant's status is based solely on the presence of a relevant offence in the applicant's criminal history. Under the new proposed criteria, less serious criminal offences will only become an aviation or maritime-security-relevant offence when a significant term of imprisonment has been imposed, while more serious offences will only require conviction. This approach places emphasis on the judgement of a court in determining the seriousness of the offence and hence its significance to the ASIC or MSIC scheme. This is a significant improvement to the transparency and accountability of the ASIC and MSIC schemes.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">Shifting the focus from low level or minor criminal offences to higher risk offences is expected to provide positive employment outcomes because more applicants will be found initially eligible for an ASIC or MSIC. These applicants may be issued their ASIC or MSIC faster than current timeframes, reducing the impact to their employment and increasing the staff available to employers. However, strengthening the schemes will mean people with serious criminal convictions will no longer be eligible to hold an ASIC or MSIC. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">Importantly, the changes presented by the Bill will not only improve the Government's ability to combat transnational and domestic organised crime, but they will also strengthen the schemes' existing national security purpose of protecting Australia's airports and ports against acts of terrorism and unlawful interference. The inclusion of new offences, such as foreign incursion and recruitment, will enhance the schemes ability to exclude persons convicted of offences of the highest severity.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Small">It is important that the Government's transport security regulatory activities remain effective and fit for purpose in an evolving security environment. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">The Bill I present today, the <span style="font-style:italic;">Transport Security Legislation Amendment Bill 2016</span>, will ensure that the transport security regulatory framework remains responsive to changes in the security environment. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">The <span style="font-style:italic;">Aviation Transport Security Act 2004</span> (which I will now refer to as the Aviation Act) establishes a regulatory system to safeguard against unlawful interference with aviation. This regulatory system aims to prevent conduct that threatens the secure operation of aircraft and airports. It is continually reviewed to ensure it mitigates current threats and the Australian public is provided with safe and secure air travel. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">As part of this continual review process, we are introducing measures at Australia's major international airports to mitigate the insider threat. Airport workers such as baggage handlers, caterers, cleaners and engineers have special access to passenger aircraft so that they can carry out their important roles. However, there is potential for this access to be exploited, either willingly or through coercion, to facilitate a terrorist attack against a passenger aircraft.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">Serious international security incidents targeting aviation, such as the bombing of Metrojet flight 9268 in Egypt on 31 October 2015 and the attempted bombing of Daallo Airlines Flight 159 in Somalia on 2 February 2016, have highlighted the continuing threat to the global aviation environment, in particular the insider threat. There is growing concern about the insider threat among the global aviation community and the Convention on International Civil Aviation, to which Australia is a signatory, places obligations on States to have measures in place to address this threat.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">The Department of Infrastructure and Regional Development (my Department), in consultation with the aviation industry, has developed a new model for strengthening airside security at Australia's nine major international airports to address the insider threat and ensure Australia meets its international civil aviation obligations for airside security. The measures introduced through the Bill are part of a broader suite of regulatory amendments that give effect to the model's three components, those being:</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">1. controls to ensure people, vehicles and goods entering airside areas at Australia's major international airports are authorised to do so;</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">2. random screening of people, vehicles and accompanying goods entering and within, the airside areas of the major international airports to detect unauthorised weapons and explosives; and</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">3. security awareness training for airport and airline employees, including contractors, that regularly work within airside areas at the major international airports.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">The Bill will introduce regulation making powers into the Aviation Act that will enable people, vehicles and goods to be randomly selected for security screening when they are inside an airside area or zone at security controlled airports. This complements existing provisions in the Act that provide regulation making powers for the screening of people, vehicles and goods before they enter an airside area or zone. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">Together, these provisions will give airports the ability to decide the best way to implement security screening controls for their airside areas. For example, for airports with few airside tenants, it may be more efficient and cost effective to apply screening controls at all airside entry points. However, for airports that host large numbers of airside tenants, each with their own access point into the airside area, it will be more practical and cost effective to apply screening controls only at some access points, and to complement this with mobile screening patrols inside the airside area.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">Separate to the strengthened airside security amendments, the Bill also makes further amendments to the Aviation Act and amends the <span style="font-style:italic;">Maritime Transport and Offshore Facilities Security Act 2003 </span>(which I will now refer to as the Maritime Act) to allow the Secretary of my Department to delegate his powers in these Acts to lower level APS employees. This will give the Department greater administrative flexibility and capacity to manage predicted industry growth, particularly in a changing security environment.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">The amendments will remove the references limiting delegations to Executive Level 2 APS employees, allowing the Secretary to delegate to lower level employees. The amendments will not expand the statutory powers of the Secretary in the Acts. The proposed changes will ensure the Government has the ability to make quality decisions while managing industry growth and responding to the changing security environment.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">I commend the Bill.</span>

                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Queensland</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">17:34</span>):  As a servant to the people of Queensland and Australia, I rise to strenuously oppose the Criminal Code Amendment (Firearms Trafficking) Bill 2016. This bill amends the Criminal Code Act 1995 (Criminal Code) in order to impose mandatory minimum sentences of five years jail for buying or selling guns or gun parts across state or national borders and doubles maximum penalties for the offence to 20 years jail. The justification for these changes is purportedly to:</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">… reflect the serious nature and potential consequences of supplying firearms and firearm parts to the illicit market.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The introduction of a mandatory minimum sentence of imprisonment for five years for these purported 'firearms trafficking offences' implements the government's ridiculous so-called 'Keeping illegal guns off our streets and our communities safe' election policy released on 26 June 2016. This repressive Criminal Code Amendment (Firearms Trafficking) Bill 2016 is just the latest illustration of the sanctimonious and illogical anti-gun philosophy pervading a significant part of the Liberal Party.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This bill obviously raises two separate issues. The first issue is the imposition by this bill of draconian penalties, including mandatory jail terms and up to 20 years maximum jail for any offence, even for a victimless crime. The second issue is the obsessive ongoing effort by enemies of freedom in this country to undermine the inalienable right of private citizens to possess firearms, of which this legislation is but the latest iteration. Throughout history, disarming citizens has always been a high priority for tyrants and totalitarian collectivists. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">First and foremost, Pauline Hanson's One Nation is utterly opposed to mandatory jail terms under any circumstances. We believe it should be up to the courts to impose the appropriate penalty. Secondly, we are implacably opposed to the imposition of jail terms for deemed offences and other victimless crimes, and certainly the idea that there should be a 20-year potential jail sentence for a victimless crime is utterly offensive for a nation that claims to be a liberal democracy. In terms of firearm laws, One Nation is absolutely opposed to efforts to undermine this crucial freedom. Unfortunately, it seems that fewer and fewer political parties share this view.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">It may be hardly surprising that the feral, pest-hugging collectivists in the Greens hate the idea of private ownership of firearms, just as they hate all other individual freedoms. The Labor Party, too, has in recent years leaned further and further to the Left and in the process has become more and more hostile to firearm ownership. However, I am afraid to say that the Liberal Party has a sorry recent history on supporting firearm ownership, and in recent years has actually been worse than Labor.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Let us not forget that in 1996 former Prime Minister John Howard, now a hero of the Labor Party, wasted nearly $400 million of taxpayers' money to forcibly acquire the registered legal guns of hundreds of thousands of law-abiding Australians as a half-baked, knee-jerk, populist reaction to the tragedy at Port Arthur. The repressive gun laws that subsequently resulted were made subsequently worse by various anti-individualist state governments, which apparently saw the victimless crime of unregistered gun possession as a more and more heinous sin.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Let us consider what actually happened in Port Arthur. A violent mental patient slaughtered scores of innocent people with an illegal weapon that had been previously surrendered to police in Victoria, a weapon that was sold back into the illegal gun market, apparently by a corrupt policeman. What rational reaction should we have had to this? Did the former Prime Minister conclude that dangerous mental patients need to be committed, corrupt police need to be severely punished, and illegal weapons need to be cracked down upon? No, he did not! Instead, the former Prime Minister cracked down on legally registered weapons owned by law-abiding citizens, none of whom had anything to do with a crime! He might as well have banned bicycles for all the relevance of this action. The absurd fallacy, apparently shared by many in this chamber, is that all guns are equally likely to be used in a crime and all gun owners are equally likely to commit one—an absolutely absurd contention. In fact, licensed firearm owners and registered weapons were not only not involved in the Port Arthur tragedy, but they continue to be uninvolved in almost all gun related crime.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Many lies continue to be told regarding the effect of this gun buyback, but here I would like to put the truth on record. Apologists for firearm restrictions have repeatedly claimed that the 1996 buyback resulted in a significant decrease in firearm homicides, but this is actually total nonsense. Prior to 1996, there was already a clear downward trend in firearm homicides, and this pattern simply continued after the buyback. The same pattern occurred in New Zealand, which continues to have liberal firearms laws, which do not even require firearm registration. Again, as with suicides, both non-firearm and firearm homicides fell by similar amounts. In fact, the trend in non-firearm homicides shows a much larger decline between the pre-buyback and post-buyback periods. This clearly indicates that crime has been falling for other reasons. It is therefore true to say that firearm homicides declined after 1996 but completely false to say that the buyback had anything to do with it. I would like the Senate to note in particular that the decline in the rate of homicides has not followed the rate of gun ownership. The number of licensed firearm owners has greatly increased since 1996, while the rate of gun related crime has declined.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I would also like to debunk another of the myths of the anti-gun lobby here, and that is the claim that there is a major risk of legally registered guns being stolen by criminals. In fact, the Australian Institute of Criminology reports that only one in every 2,500 guns is stolen, a rate of four-hundredths of one per cent. Of the 664 guns stolen, as described in their recent report only three were used in the commission of a crime.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The firearms phobia that began with John Howard's forced buyback culminated in that state of affairs that former Prime Minister Tony Abbott, in a fit of self-righteous indignation, called 'our gold-standard gun laws'. All I can say is that if our repressive gun laws are a 'gold standard', then by the same criteria Stalin's Russia would have been considered the 'platinum standard'.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The truth is that legal firearms ownership not only does not lead to gun related crime, but it actually reduces it. More legal guns actually mean less crime. It is no coincidence that the state of Illinois in the United States, which has some of the most restrictive gun laws, has one of the highest rates of gun crime, whilst the state of Texas, which has some of the most liberal gun laws has one of the lowest rates of gun related crime.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">If we look at the details of the latest attack on firearms ownership in the Criminal Code Amendment (Firearms Trafficking) Bill 2016, we find the confected crime of 'firearms trafficking', for which these draconian penalties are proposed. The phrase 'firearms trafficking' immediately conjures to mind images of cut-throat smugglers with crates of Kalashnikov assault rifles and RPG-7s in the hold of a rusting cargo ship bound for somewhere in deepest, darkest Africa. However, in fact in this bill it turns out that what is called 'firearms trafficking' may consist of nothing more than buying or selling interstate a single gun part—for example, a firing pin—or buying a shotgun or bolt action rifle not used in any crime, or even carrying an unregistered gun across state borders and letting someone else borrow it. In this bill, use of the term 'firearms trafficking' is ridiculous anti-gun propaganda. Deeming buying or selling a single gun or gun part as firearms trafficking is like calling buying a single joint 'drug dealing'. The intentional misuse of the term is simply an attempt to dramatise the offence to help to justify the absurdly harsh penalties. Worse still, this bill will have unintended consequences in which law-abiding, licensed firearm owners may face up to 20 years jail simply by ordering a small part for one of their registered guns from a website which, unbeknown to them, sources its stock from interstate or overseas. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">In addition to the confected nature of the victimless offence, the penalties too are something that might be expected for a horrendous crime: minimum five-year mandatory jail terms and maximum penalties of 20 years prison—is the government serious? Imposing mandatory minimum five-year jail terms and 20-year maximum penalties, as proposed, are penalties which may well be in excess of those imposed on people who commit sexual assault, robbery or even, in some cases, murder. These unbelievably severe mandatory minimum and maximum penalties for a victimless crime must be considered a new low for this very illiberal Liberal government and are totally out of all proportion to the seriousness of the offence.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Sadly, and in many ways reflecting the progressive shift to the left—to the control side of politics—of all mainstream political parties, the penalties that this bill proposes reflect the socialist approach of assuming that everyone is equally likely to commit a crime and trying to prevent the actions of a criminal minority by punishing everyone indiscriminately. If we are to still claim Australia is a liberal democracy that values the rights of the individual, it is incumbent on us to promote freedom over control. That is what Pauline Hanson's One Nation is all about—individual freedom and responsibility—and the voters are getting it.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I further draw the attention of the Senate to the fact that the imposition of increased maximum penalties and mandatory jail terms set out in this bill are opposed by both the Australian Human Rights Commission and the New South Wales Council for Civil Liberties, while the mandatory minimum jail sentences are opposed by the Law Council of Australia. So, even if these organisations may not share One Nation's unqualified support for law-abiding ownership of firearms, they do at least share our implacable opposition to the severe penalties that the bill automatically proposes.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">In the final analysis, however, this terrible legislation reflects the Liberal Party's complete acquiescence to the left-wing agenda—to the control side of politics—of prioritising punishment for politically incorrect victimless crimes, while going soft on violent offenders. If this bill is passed, people who use guns to commit serious crimes, including drug dealing and armed robbery, may actually face significantly lesser penalties than someone simply buying a gun part from a website. Instead of imposing draconian penalties on people who simply possess firearms, the government should be imposing stronger penalties on people who actually use guns to commit crimes. Accordingly, we urge all our fellow senators to join our One Nation colleagues in denouncing this draconian, Stalinesque bill and vote against it.</span>

                      <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Senator LEYONHJELM</span>
                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">New South Wales</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">17:48</span>):  The government bill before us today, the Criminal Code Amendment (Firearms Trafficking) Bill 2016, seeks to introduce mandatory minimum sentences for firearms trafficking. I opposed it last time it was before the Senate; I oppose mandatory sentencing. The sentence for individuals found guilty of firearms trafficking should be set by a judge—not by a politician and not by a shock jock, but by a judge. Only a judge can know all the circumstances of the guilty individual and their deeds: whether they were the ringleader or the accessory, whether they were coerced, whether they have done it before. The punishment cannot fit the crime unless factors such as these are considered. Mandatory sentencing is an attack by the executive on the judiciary.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We have seen attacks on the judiciary by the executive recently in the United States. Such attacks can be popular, but they undermine one of the safeguards keeping us from an authoritarian society. When the executive attacks the judiciary, they undermine the rule of law. This is an attack on our civil society and on our freedom. I call on all parties in this place, each of which has been dipping into President Trump's playlist, to resist the temptation to attack our system of law for cheap political points.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The government bill before us today also seeks to increase maximum sentences for firearms trafficking. The maximum term of imprisonment would double from 10 to 20 years, and the maximum fine would double from $450,000 to $900,000. Not to be outdone, the Nick Xenophon Team is pushing for an amendment to triple the maximum term of imprisonment to 30 years. Also not to be outdone, Labor is pushing for an amendment to increase the maximum penalty for extensive firearms trafficking to life imprisonment and a fine of $1.35 million. Neither the Liberal-National government nor the Nick Xenophon Team nor Labor have pointed out a single case where the current maximum penalties have been applied. In fact, they have failed to point out a single case of a successful conviction for firearms trafficking. And nobody has paused for even a second to consider whether firearms trafficking is a problem or why it might be. Could it possibly be similar to the situation with recreational drugs? Drug trafficking would not be a problem if our national policy was not one of prohibition. Just ask Portugal. Could it be similar to trafficking in illicit cigarettes and tobacco, something that did not even exist until tobacco taxes were jacked up so high that cheap smuggled cigarettes became attractive? Nobody has demonstrated why the problem of firearms trafficking is sufficiently serious to justify this bill. In fact, nobody has talked about how serious it is at all. The suggestion is that it is not at all serious. It looks to me as if the bill's only purpose is to appear tough on crime—and, of course, tough on those wicked, wicked evil guns.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I do not like to see firearms in criminal hands. They give law-abiding firearms owners a bad reputation. But this bill will do nothing to keep them in safe hands. If you really want to deter firearms trafficking, you have to make the trafficker think there is a strong chance they will be caught. Instead of doing the hard yards of working out why firearms trafficking might be more attractive than it used to be, if, indeed, it is, and why our customs and police forces are failing to stop firearms trafficking, if, indeed, they are, and then instead fixing the problem, we have the Liberal-National government, the Nick Xenophon Team and Labor just fiddling with the statutes, as if the problem of firearms trafficking can be eliminated at the stroke of a pen. This is lazy and deceitful.</span>

                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The Liberal Democrats reject the idea that you can increase a maximum penalty and a problem goes away. I reject this bill. I reject the silly amendments and I am dismayed by the parties in this place who support them.</span>

Due to their imperishable nature, firearms can remain in the illicit market for decades and be used in the commission of countless crimes over their lifespan.</span></span>

                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech" style="font-weight:bold;">It is regrettable that the opposition has not supported mandatory minimum sentences. Although the opposition claims to oppose mandatory minimum sentences, it has support them on several occasions—for example, in 2010 with people-smuggling offences in the Migration Act. As a general rule, mandatory minimum sentences ought not to form part of our criminal law, except in exceptional circumstances. It is the government's position that these circumstances are exceptional and mandatory minimum sentences are reserved for the most serious crimes. And, as Senator Williams noted, firearms trafficking is a serious offence for which the penalty must fit the crime. Not only is it, itself, a serious offence but it provides the gateway for the commission by those who traffic in firearms for the commission of other serious offences. So the government is unconvinced by the argument that this case—that is, the serious offence of trafficking in firearms—does not fall within the exception to the general rule against mandatory minimum sentencing.</span>

                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech" style="font-weight:bold;">The government appreciates the support of Senator Xenophon and senators from the Nick Xenophon Team for strong maximum penalties for firearms trafficking offences. However, once again, it is unfortunate that they do not see the benefit of taking a similarly strong approach to enforcing minimum sentences for such grave offences.</span>

                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech" style="font-weight:bold;">I commend the bill to the Senate. I look forward to the committee stage of the debate. But the resolution of the government to deal appropriately with what I think most members of the Australian community do regard as a serious matter which regards serious treatment, particularly in the sentences which the courts should award to those convicted of such crimes, is something the government is determined to deal with.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I want to make some brief comments about these amendments. As flagged in my speech in the second reading debate, the opposition proposes to amend this bill to create aggravated offences for firearms trafficking. I have referenced previously the government's deep division and disunity on guns, and Labor is in the position of having to push for tougher rules against firearms trafficking.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This amendment would create aggravated offences for cross-border firearms trafficking and international firearms trafficking under divisions 360 and 361 of the Criminal Code. These offences would target the worst forms of firearms trafficking and attract a maximum penalty of life imprisonment, 7,500 penalty units or both, which would bring the maximum penalty for firearms trafficking up to the maximum penalty for drug trafficking. The opposition believes that the serious nature of supplying firearms and firearm parts to the illicit market warrants this significant penalty. The imperishable nature of firearms also means that illicit firearms remain a serious threat to the Australian community for many years. During this time they can all too easily fall into the hands of criminal gangs or terrorists.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Labor sought to pass these measures some five years ago as part of the Crimes Legislation Amendment (Organised Crime and Other Measures) Bill 2012, a bill which passed the House with the support of the coalition, then in opposition, and the crossbench. Although the bill did not pass the Senate prior to the 2013 federal election, the Senate committee inquiry into the 2012 bill, conducted by both government and opposition senators, supported the introduction of such aggravated offences for firearms trafficking. As I said, these measures were introduced five years ago. It is disappointing that this work was not taken up by the coalition when they won government. With growing gun crime in our communities and continual reports of mass firearms trafficking through the media and otherwise, we believe that toughening our firearms trafficking laws as laid out in the amendments is appropriate.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The offences would capture trafficking of 50 or more firearms, 50 or more firearm parts that might be used to make one or more firearms, or a combination of both firearms and parts such that the sum of actual firearms and firearms that might be constituted by the parts is 50 or more. This could occur all on one occasion or on two or more occasions. This will target firearms trafficking enterprises engaged in the mass distribution and exchange of firearms. The threshold quantity of 50 or more firearms or firearm parts for the aggravated offences is identical to that in the bill that Labor introduced in 2012. It is a threshold quantity significantly higher than those in existing state or territory offences. That is because the aggravated offences attract a maximum penalty of life imprisonment, which is obviously a very serious penalty. Basic offences for firearms trafficking will still apply to trafficking which does not reach this threshold, which attracts a maximum penalty of 20 years, 5,000 penalty units or both.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">As I referenced earlier today, the Australian Criminal Intelligence Commission estimates there are up to 600,000 illegal guns in our community. Ten thousand of these are predicted to be handguns, which, of course, are the weapon of choice for many criminal elements. The amendments that the opposition is proposing will send a strong message about the seriousness with which the parliament views firearms trafficking and allow our courts to lock up the worst traffickers for life. I commend the amendments to the chamber.</span>

                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Queensland</span>—<span class="HPS-MinisterialTitles">Attorney-General, Vice-President of the Executive Council and Leader of the Government in the Senate</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">18:04</span>):  Unfortunately, notwithstanding the attempt to characterise the Labor Party 's position as a strong one, this is a weaker position than the government's. Senator Wong has indicated that she opposes mandatory minimum sentences and seeks to offer an alternative, and that is the creation of a circumstance of aggravation with a higher maximum sentence. There is no question whatsoever that prescribing mandatory minimum sentences is a much clearer indication of the parliament's view of the seriousness of an offence than creating a new, aggravated offence, particularly in view of the fact that courts, in sentencing, already take into account circumstances of aggravation when determining where within the sentencing range a particular penalty of imprisonment should be imposed. So Labor's attempt to portray themselves as taking a tough position will convince no-one. What Senator Wong is in fact doing is seeking to weaken the position by opposing the one effective measure, the one effective signal, that this parliament can send, and that is a mandatory minimum sentence so that no gun-trafficking offender will escape a term of imprisonment. That is a strong message. Anything less than that is a weaker message.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I appreciate that the Labor Party support the principles of this legislation. I accept that they take a serious view of the nature of the crime, that overall they are supportive, and that they will get their amendment passed given the state of the numbers in the Senate on this issue. But I regret to say that what the Senate, if it passes Senator Wong's amendment, will have done will have been to settle for a weaker message than the government would wish to see.</span>

I support Senator Wong and her appeal to get the maximum sentence increased to 30 years. If our magistrates and judges were doing their jobs properly, we would not need any minimum sentences. We see, in court after court, maximum sentences where state governments are bowing to popular pressure and increasing maximum sentences, but still you are seeing people walk free with suspended sentences, no sentences, short jail terms or what. On the other hand, I agree with the Attorney-General when he says that with the five-year minimum no drug trafficker will escape jail. </span>

But, sadly, some of our judges and some of our courts are such bleeding hearts about such issues that it would not surprise me, and that is why I will be supporting the government today. </span>

I note that the minister's response really just relied on saying 'Labor has a weaker positon', without really backing that up. I think this is actually an important debate when we come to deal with the issue of mandatory sentencing. It is worth reflecting on and giving that some time, because it is an important issue when it comes to delivering fair justice in our society. </span>

Mandatory sentences are not effective at deterring crime. I would like to again share some advice from experts in the field because, as I said, it is a very important matter and when we have the Attorney-General actually arguing for mandatory sentencing, I think it is worth fleshing this out. </span>

We have seen that in New South Wales with a very strong law and order approach from Labor, Liberal and National parties over the years. We are seeing it with the failure of terrorist laws that take a similar approach. I just want to put on the record yet again that the Greens—while we are supporting Labor amendments, really there is a major failure with this legislation overall in its approach to public safety when it comes to firearms. We need a national firearms agreement that works and that is strengthened. We still do not have that national firearms integration system. We still cannot trace firearms from the cradle to the grave. </span>

Because this is also a debate about one's position on mandatory sentencing, it is worth noting what some of the experts have said on this. The Law Council has voiced its unconditional opposition to mandatory sentencing as a penalty for any criminal offence on the basis that it raises the potential for unintended consequences. They have set that out in detail in many documents over the years. The Law Council goes on in their submission on this bill to say that imposing mandatory minimum imprisonment sentences is contrary to other sentencing provisions which judges apply. They point out that section 17A of the Crimes Act provides that a sentencing court shall not pass a sentence of imprisonment unless, having considered all other sentences, it is satisfied that no other sentence is appropriate in the circumstances. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">All that ability—the nuances that judges need in determining the human aspect of it, the circumstances that cannot be encapsulated in law—is lost if you go down the path of mandatory sentencing. That is why I wanted to speak further on this, because it is a very, very serious move that the government is attempting to use here, again just to bang the drum that they are doing something about firearm violence when they are not addressing the main game. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">To stay with some of the advice from experts on this issue, it is also worth noting that the Australian Strategic Policy Institute has been very informative on mandatory minimum penalties reducing or deterring the importation of illegal firearms. This is a quote from the Australian Strategic Policy Institute:</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">… if the desired outcome is to reduce the availability of illegal firearms in Australian communities the focus needs be on strategies which increase the likelihood that a firearms trafficker will be caught. Those strategies should focus on continuing to enhance our border agencies' capabilities to detect and investigate illicit firearm trafficking at the border.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">Mandatory sentencing of illicit firearms traffickers … won't deliver the desired results.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">It is very emphatic. The people who work in this field—and the Attorney-General would clearly know this—have rejected this approach time and time again. Considering the strength of the body of evidence from experts that mandatory sentencing does not work, I would like to ask the Attorney-General why he is persisting to use this discredited approach to firearm crimes. Why does he persist? I am interested in your response, Attorney-General.</span>

If you knew anything about this area, you would know that among criminologists and penologists there is a debate about the efficacy of various sentencing models and sentencing tariffs. There are some criminologists and penologists who agree with you, but, like those who invoke the language of experts in this chamber so commonly do, you entirely disregard the very relevant fact that there is a vigorous debate in that discipline among scholars and among experts. There are some who agree with you and there are others who vigorously disagree with you, but I think you will find, Senator Rhiannon, that among those who practise in the criminal courts and among judges who conduct criminal proceedings the overwhelming weight of opinion is that in appropriate cases, particularly in cases of premeditation such as trafficking in arms—which is classically an offence of premeditation rather than an offence which may be committed by an individual on impulse or in the heat of the moment—the prospect of an inevitable jail term does have a measurable deterrent effect. So, please, Senator Rhiannon, do not be so intellectually dishonest as to say, 'The experts say this,' when the fact is that there is a vigorous debate among scholars and practitioners. But the preponderant view is that in relation particularly to offences of premeditation the inevitability of a jail term does have a deterrent effect.</span>

You are the one who, in the context of advancing your arguments, has been banging the drum about mandatory sentencing rather than acknowledging that there are a range of opinions here. All I was doing was injecting into the debate some of the views that you have failed to bring into this discussion. Again you fall back on attacks and personal abuse, rather than giving the evidence that surely you should be.

                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">
                    <a href="AI6" type="MemberSpeech">
                      <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Senator CAMERON</span>
                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">New South Wales</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">19:43</span>):  I rise to speak in opposition to the latest government attempt to reduce wages and conditions and set up a system that exposes young workers to exploitation and exposes existing employees to unfair competition from exploited workers. Young Australian will be denied award wages and conditions. They will be classified as interns and not employees in a not so subtle expression of coalition contempt for decent wages, decent conditions and health and safety on the job.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The latest iteration of the government's antiworking agenda is this bill, the Social Security Legislation Amendment (Youth Jobs Path: Prepare, Trial, Hire) Bill 2016. It continues the coalition tradition of attacking worker protections. This bill sits comfortably in the tradition of Work Choices and the ABCC.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The bill is designed to give effect to so-called internships and provide wage subsidies, which were elements of the Youth Jobs PaTH measure announced in the 2016-17 budget as part of the youth employment package. The Youth Jobs PaTH program is being marketed as providing job seekers aged 17 to 24 years who have been in receipt of jobactive services for six months with work experience and to allegedly maximise their prospects of subsequently gaining employment. The reality is that it will expose them to unscrupulous employers with no access to workers compensation, no award wages and no union protection. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This bill will amend the Social Security (Administration) Act 1999 and the Veterans' Entitlements Act 1986 so the miserly $200 payment that interns receive is not counted as income for social security or veterans entitlements purpose. Secondly, it will amend the Social Security act to allow young people to suspend their payments if they are employed. They can then restart without reapplying if they lose their job internship through no fault of their own within 28 weeks. How this no fault of your own will ever be analysed and determined, I do not know.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">These job seekers will be placed into so-called voluntary internships, working for between 15 and 25 hours a week for between four and 12 weeks. For this they will receive payments of $200 per fortnight—not a week, a fortnight—on top of their income support payments. For many this will not be sufficient to cover the cost of travelling to work and the extra expenses associated with work. Businesses will be looked after; they will be paid $1000 to take on an intern and will receive a wage subsidy of between $6500 and $10,000 if they have participants at the conclusion of the internship—with an offer of a job that is expected to be ongoing and for an average of 20 hours a week over the six-month period. So they get well rewarded for exploiting young workers. That is the reality. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Instead of tackling the real issue of youth unemployment, the government has come up with a hastily cobbled together scheme that offers no solution to the problem of youth unemployment. Minister Cash was completely at sea during the estimates hearings when asked for details of how this bill would operate in real life. This bill, if passed, creates a pool of cut-price young workers who will be working at a rate that is less than the national minimum wage. The government is arguing that PaTH is needed to fix youth unemployment. Despite promising it would tackle youth unemployment, an incompetent Turnbull government has failed to deliver.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">On the Turnbull government's watch, youth unemployment has climbed to 13.3 per cent, double the overall rate of unemployment. According to their own figures, there are nearly 300,000 unemployed young people between the ages of 15 and 24. More than one million Australians are underemployed. On top of this, the department acknowledges there are another 170,000 people who have been unemployed for more than a year and who are discouraged from seeking jobs that are non-existent.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This government has left young Australians high and dry. It is unable to come up with a real plan to find jobs for our young people. In the meantime they are trying to sneak through changes in their Omnibus bill which will see young unemployed people left without any form of income for a month when they come to the government seeking assistance to survive. This mob has an absolute contempt for the unemployed, an absolute contempt for working-class kids and an absolute contempt for fairness and reasonableness in their dealings with young people.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This will simply be another failed coalition policy where they push young unemployed people into programs that do nothing to assist them into real, meaningful employment. You only have to look at the Work for the Dole program, where almost 90 per cent of the participants did not get a full-time job three months after finishing the program. Remember the Work for the Dole program and all the great speeches we had from the other side of the chamber? What a great thing Work for the Dole is! What a great program—just get these kids into some work and everything will be okay. It has been a massive failure in similar terms to this government as a failure.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">What has been the response of the Turnbull government to this failure? They have taken over $752 million out of Work for the Dole and shifted it into PaTH—that great successful program, let us take $752 million out and try and do something else. That is the reality: you fit one failed program into what will be another failed program. The very serious risk is that PaTH will displace people who would otherwise be employed to fill genuine vacancies. PaTH will take in 30,000 young Australians, classify them as interns and place them in businesses around the country in an already weakened labour market. Young people trying to get into entry-level employment will be competing with the people in the PaTH program, operating as cut-price labour for government subsidised employers.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The Turnbull government's definition of an intern is not going to match the public's idea of what an intern is. These young people will not be working in the white-collar roles with which interns are typically associated; in professional services or law firms. I do not think there will be any movies made about these interns. I do not think Hollywood will be looking at all the glamour for these young workers forced into below award wages, below poverty line wages. There will be no movies made about these interns. This is another example of an uncaring government with no answers for the unemployed, no answers for young Australians.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">What we will see are these interns working as waiters, working as shop assistants and even working as builders' labourers—areas where young people would get a chance, get an opportunity to get an award wage and maybe even a bit better than an award wage if they happen to have a good union like the CFMEU. But what are we going to get here? We are going to get young kids put into an area where there is already massive exploitation so more intern waiters, intern shop assistants, intern builders' labourers—the traditional employers of young people looking for their first full-time job. The fast food chains, the big retail stores are going to be supplied with a steady stream of interns, who will be working at a rate that is less than national minimum wage. The national minimum wage is $17.70 an hour but a PaTH participant, who works 25 hours a week and who receives all of their Newstart payments plus the $200 payment, will earn just $14.50 an hour. This is simply exploitation of young people.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">People have rightly been concerned about the cases of workers exploitation when wage scandals come to light. Can you imagine being an intern at 7-Eleven? Can you imagine being an intern at Pizza Hut? Can you imagine being an intern at Baiada Poultry? Imagine the exploitation that will go on there under this proposal. Cleaners working in Myer stores are exploited yet young people are going to go in there as interns and Myer is going to get paid by this mob to rip young workers off; that is the reality. Most recently we have seen Dominoes Pizza. How many young people have started off in Dominoes Pizza to go into their first job? We have seen Dominoes Pizza are ripping off young people yet they will be eligible to get this PaTH payment. It just beggars belief.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">There are examples of apprentice exploitation. Even when legally established wages are in place, employers exploit young workers. The Fair Work Ombudsman, in response to the constant flow of complaints received from the domestic building industry and in response to the vulnerable nature of apprentices working within the industry, audited Victorian building firms between 2011 and 2012 and found that 94 per cent of the 164 employers broke laws covering apprentices. Fifty-seven per cent of them failed to pay apprentices properly. And an ombudsman's random audit in 2013 of 142 businesses in Western Australia, South Australia and the Northern Territory found that more than half breached workplace laws and almost a quarter had underpaid their apprentices by a combined total of $67,180. These are apprentices who would have a contract for employment and a contract for training yet what we are seeing is systematic exploitation of these young workers.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">What we are hearing from this mob on the other side is that they want to put some of the most disadvantaged young kids into a situation where there will be even more exploitation even more on vulnerable young Australians. Why would our community stand for government program that sanctions undercutting the minimum wage?</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The Australian Chamber of Commerce and Industry has made a submission to the Senate inquiry into the PaTH program stating that the industry has the places to meet the demand of the program. I say to the Australian Chamber of Commerce and Industry: why are you not filling these places by hiring the many young jobseekers who need the work right now? I can tell you why, it is because the biggest advocates, the biggest cheerleaders for PaTH—big business—can see a pool of young unemployed Australians working at cut-price rates below the national minimum wage being used in a way that could potentially undercut jobs and undercut wages.</span>
                </p>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">What happens to interns who are involved in a workplace accident? Will they be covered by worker's compensation? According to the government, that will depend on the worker's compensation regime that operates in the particular state or territory in which these interns find themselves. Are you kidding me? You cannot make workplace safety in a program you devised someone else's problem. You cannot push 30,000 young people out into internships earning below the minimum wage with no guarantee of a job after the internship and palm off the fundamental issues of protecting young workers to the states. In some states and territories, an intern may be considered a volunteer, not actually an employee, and therefore unable to access worker's compensation. And it is not just Labor that has these concerns. ACOSS were damning in their assessment of participant protections.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">There is the more important question: after being used for up to three months at a rate below the national minimum wage, will these interns actually get a job? Interns Australia wrote in the <span style="font-style:italic;">Sydney Morning Herald</span> that unpaid interns are only offered employment with the same organisation 20 per cent of the time. Their conclusions about the PaTH program are absolutely scathing. They said:</span>
                </p>

                  <span class="HPS-Small">It creates an Australia where exploited interns are widespread but entry-level jobs are scarce, where business either flagrantly exploits its newest workers or doesn't know whether to hire them, and where the rights of interns are more confused and muddled than ever before.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">PaTH interns were supposed to be placed into businesses where there were real vacancies. That is the way it was described when this program was announced. But since announcing PaTH the Turnbull government quickly watered down this pledge to 'a reasonable prospect of a job'. There is genuine concern that young Australians participating in PaTH could be used and discarded every four to 12 weeks. For all they may deny it, this government share these concerns. Why else would this legislation provide a fallback position where the jobseeker payments are only suspended in cases where they lose their job through no fault of their own from the business that receives a youth bonus wage subsidy in relation to them under the Youth Jobs PaTH program? Interns Australia noted to the Senate inquiry:</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Small">… we have concerns this provision may encourage employers to hire an employee to receive the subsidy, terminate their employment, then hire another employee to receive the subsidy again.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Labor is opposed to this bill. This is a bill that is simply about exploitation. As I have said, this is a bill that stands alongside the Work Choices and ABCC bills as bills that are designed to exploit workers and vulnerable people and are about denying workers access to decent union representation and decent rights and conditions on the job.

But, when that failed, they had to move to this approach. This approach is really concerning because it exploits young people and advantages unscrupulous employers. No-one can convince me that this is going to work effectively, and the government should hang their heads in shame for exploiting young Australians.</span>

                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Western Australia</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">20:03</span>):  Unfortunately, unemployment in our nation is an issue that disproportionately impacts on young people. Youth unemployment is at double the national unemployment average—that is, nearly 300,000 young people across our nation are unemployed. We all know that this is an unacceptable statistic and, sadly, it is rising. But the primary cause of this unemployment is a lack of economic growth. Low-skilled and inexperienced young people are particularly vulnerable to these conditions in the job market. There are poor economic growth in particular pockets around our nation where this is a problem.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">It is a particular problem in my home state of Western Australia, where youth unemployment, I am sad to say, is reaching crisis point. The unemployment rates are still above global financial crisis levels. In some parts of Western Australia, unemployment is more than double the national average. All over my home state of WA, people are feeling it, from our southern metropolitan suburbs like Pinjarra, Mandurah, Rockingham and Kwinana right up to northern suburbs like Yanchep, Wanneroo, Joondalup and through our wheat belt region. This, I believe, is because the Barnett government has squandered our mining boom. It has hollowed out our economy. It did not invest in jobs and training for the future, and young people in WA are now, very sadly, paying the price for that.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This is very much why I am glad to see the work that Labor has done, with Bill Shorten and WA opposition leader Mark McGowan announcing in Perth earlier this month that they are working together on that job creation. It is about diversifying our economy and ensuring that we have jobs for the future. What we have seen under the watch of the coalition, both at a state and at a federal level, is a complete lack of commitment to diversifying the economy and looking to the industries of the future. My good colleague Senator Doug Cameron's remarks really highlight that.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">What we want to see in our nation is an opportunity for people to go to university or TAFE being confident that they will have a high-skilled, well-paid job at the end of it. What we have seen in our nation is a government in Western Australia that has been very focused on making sure that these jobs, frankly, go offshore. Each year they send a list here to Canberra promoting overseas workers into Western Australia in traditional trades where we already have large numbers of unemployed people back home. The Liberals are continuing to send these jobs overseas. The latest example is the Malaysian footbridge. That bridge could and should have been built in Western Australia, and the fact that the WA Liberal government contracted for that bridge to be built overseas is a disgrace. I cannot really fathom why the state government would do that when workshops in our home state are empty and young people are in desperate need of work. So I am really pleased to highlight the state Labor commitment to putting local jobs, training and apprenticeships at the heart of everything we do.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This stands in stark contrast to the legislation before us tonight. What we really want to see are commitments like making it law that government departments, including health, education, transport and housing are required to provide more apprenticeships for local people; and putting in place Western Australian industry participation plans that require as a part of all bidding processes for construction work across government a consideration of apprenticeships and traineeships. These are the commitments that state Labor has made in Western Australia and these are where you will find solutions to youth unemployment nationally, not in the kind of misplaced legislation that we have before us tonight. These are the real solutions to unemployment in our nation. They are the right approach. This is the approach that you should be taking at a national level.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">But, sadly, where is the Turnbull government on this question? In our country we need a solution to unemployment that is much better than the lazy policy approach that simply provides employers with free Labor. That is the solution you have put forward in this place. We need a solution that goes beyond your mantra of jobs and growth. We keep hearing this from a government—that their priority is jobs and growth—but, sadly, you are failing on this front. You are failing to tackle unemployment, which is why you are creating in the legislation before us these proxy jobs that are not real jobs at all.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Our nation is desperate for solutions to unemployment. I meet young people all the time in Western Australia who are extremely concerned about their future. This bill is not providing a solution for them. The introduction of a 12-week internships for jobseekers is a major change to employment program arrangements, and it is one that needs to be scrutinised very carefully by this place. It is a major change that should not be introduced until the concerns of the community have been resolved, as Senator Cameron outlined.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We have before us a really poor attempt at resolving the issue of youth unemployment. It will not improve outcomes for jobseekers. It is unlikely that it will make a difference to the unemployment rate for young people in our country.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The government is claiming that the measures in this bill are non-controversial, but in actual fact they form part of a much broader new program design that undermines the workforce standards that we here in Australia hold dear. A similar program in Ireland has been discontinued and one in the UK has been the subject of much controversy.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">In theory, what we have before us is something that is supposed to prepare young people for work by providing young job seekers aged 17 to 27 with pre-employment training and placement in voluntary internships of between four and six weeks. In this time they may work from 15 to 25 hours a week and will receive bonus payments of up to $200 a fortnight on top of their current income support payments. If you do the maths on that, an intern who works 25 hours per week but receives only their Newstart payments plus an extra $200 payment will earn just $14.50 an hour, and that is $3.20 less than the minimum wage. This means that young people participating in this program will be paid less than the minimum wage. Young people who are working, providing value to employers, contributing to a workforce and contributing to our economy will be paid below the minimum wage. This is simply not good enough.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">If someone is working they should be paid properly for that work, regardless of the circumstances. If a young person is going to be making any meaningful contribution to an employer they should be fairly remunerated. This has been and should be a basic tenet of workplace rights in our country. What we see here, sadly, is a classic race to the bottom attitude. It is an attitude we have seen time and time again from this Liberal government and the ones who came before them.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">What we also see here in the race to the bottom and the displacement of wages is the displacement of young people who would be paid properly to do those jobs. As Senator Cameron highlighted, there is nothing in this legislation that provides any guarantee that what you are putting forward is just providing a cheap labour subsidy to employers while displacing real people from real jobs. So this is not a fair deal for young jobseekers. In fact, it could make the situation much worse. It opens the door to the exploitation of young people who are already vulnerable and often in desperate circumstances. There are no restrictions on the times that interns will be required to work, leaving them open to working beyond ordinary working hours, with no penalty rates in recognition of evening or weekend work.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Interns under this program will not be classified as employees and, such being the case, will not be covered by occupational health and safety laws. What an appalling part of the legislation before us. This puts their safety at significant risk. It means there is no guarantee of a right to workers compensation should an intern injure themselves at work. It also seems that there are no provisions for checks to ensure that workplaces hiring interns are meeting health and safety requirements. We should not be allowing our young people to enter into the workforce without adequate protections for their health and safety.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This program also provides little protection from unfair dismissal. Increasingly, we are seeing people in our country, especially young people, feeling less and less secure at work. This is something that government should be addressing by providing more secure employment. There has been no detail from the government on what the work will actually entail. They cannot even tell us whether the participants will simply be observing the workplace or actually working.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">There are also no assurances that employers will not be able to take advantage of the program. What is to stop employers cycling through young interns every 12 weeks to make the most of free labour and incentive payments from the government? We will see young jobseekers across the country stacking supermarket shelves or washing dishes in restaurants for below the minimum wage, gaining no skills, and with no extra incentive for the employer to keep them on long term or provide them with any training. Is this what this program will see? And, whilst the program opens up the potential for these kinds of exploitation, there is no provision for advice or support for young jobseekers going through the program. It does not outline how participants will be supported to get to and from their internships or the required training. Travel costs have the potential to be a huge burden on young jobseekers, particularly from our outermost metropolitan or rural areas and the areas that most need that support. Other additional costs such as appropriate workwear or safety gear are also a consideration for how they will be able to meet the costs associated with the program. I am looking forward to an explanation from the government on these issues. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">What we want is a fair deal for young jobseekers in the legislation before us, but I do not believe that is what we have. It is putting existing jobs at risk, with the potential for existing workers to be replaced with cheaper labour. While the government claim that internships will be monitored to ensure that this churn will not happen, it is not clear how they are actually going to do this. There is no limit on how many participants can be used in any one company, so there is nothing stopping employers from using interns to complete their work rather than using permanent employees. This has the potential to undercut the workforce and force even more people into unemployment. We have no sanctions for employers who do this. What is to stop employers using this legislation and this program from using free labour instead of their existing workforce? Why would an employer pay their existing workforce weekend or night time penalty rates when they can use an intern under this program who is being paid by the government not only below the applicable penalty rates but below our country's minimum wage? The PaTH program could allow all of that to happen.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">In addition to all of those issues there is no evidence that the program will even work. There is no provision for evaluation or review—no standards by which to measure the success of the program. The program also does not specify where or how participants will acquire the necessary skills to gain long-term employment. Evidence shows that formal training providing skills and knowledge is the key to better outcomes for jobseekers. In order for a program such as this to be successful, the training provided must be meaningful and linked to jobseekers' work experience. There are many such programs that have proven their worth in our nation's history, but it is an area that has not been adequately considered in this program.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">As I have already said, in the UK a program similar to this was introduced in 2013. Fewer than half the estimated placements were made, and, I am sad to say, there was no identifiable increase in real job placements as a result of that. I really do not see how, as result of adopting a failed program here in Australia, there will be a different outcome. What we see is a program that has been put together quickly and without the thought or consultation that is required. Rather than quickly putting together a program with no long-term plan for its success, the government should be delaying the implementation of the program and be clear about the program's objectives, as well as providing proper evaluation and review processes. These elements are captured in the motion that Senator Cameron moved this evening.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The program we have before us looks like it has been designed to be a quick-fix solution to cover up the government's failure to fix unemployment in our country. It is being used as an excuse to cover up the failing of other government job programs, such as Work for the Dole. Work for the Dole programs required young people who were unemployed for more than six months to participate in an approved activity for up to 25 hours a week for six months of the year. These programs, which paid participants only $10.40 a week on top of their income support payments, have demonstrably failed at getting people into paid employment. The government's own figures show that 90 per cent of Work for the Dole participants are not in full time work three months after finishing the program. Irrespective of whether participants have been in or out of the program, their employment prospects are probably much the same. What we lack is real training, real engagement and real jobs for these people.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">While this program shows some improvements on the Work for the Dole disaster, such as increasing the wage bonus to $200 a week, it is not ready to be implemented and it does not adequately protect the rights of young jobseekers in our country. This program is diverting funding from one ineffective program to another ineffective—and potentially exploitative—program. The government could fix some of these issues by increasing the rate of the bonus payment to meet the minimum wage, by decreasing the maximum hours worked, by ensuring that workers are covered by workers compensation, and by making the objectives clear. These are all things that Senator Cameron has called on the government to do. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This all really does beg the question: why has the government refused to do this? I guess it comes down to the government's appalling record on jobs. They are a government that time and time again have attempted to undercut the rights and conditions of workers. We saw this with their attacks on penalty rates, we saw it with their anti-union ABCC agenda, and we saw it in their unfair public service bargaining framework. Again we see it here tonight in our chamber. The government show complete disregard for young people and a complete misunderstanding of the complexities of youth unemployment. Indeed, it was this government who were considering cutting all benefits for jobseekers for six months while they were looking for work. What an appalling thing to do. Here in question time today we had a rush to come to the aid of farmers in need but not a rush to come to the aid of young jobseekers facing unemployment. It seems like the government have a framework for the worthy and unworthy poor in our country, and it is one that I very firmly reject. It is a disgrace for this government to say that young people have an obligation to look for work, whilst taking no obligation themselves to create jobs so they can find that work.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">In conclusion, this Youth Jobs PaTH Program is an ill-considered, ineffective and potentially exploitative response to the growing issue of youth unemployment in our country. Young people in our country deserve better than this. Labor is demanding a better deal from this. Labor is calling for the PaTH program to be deferred until the issues we have raised and the issues the community have raised have been squarely addressed. Continuing with this program despite its obvious flaws is doing a disservice to those people who are in desperate need of a real solution to unemployment in our country. This program, introduced by Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull, is not creating jobs. It does not give young jobseekers the skills and opportunities they need for long-term work. This program is simply subsidising employers to place jobseekers into cheap work with no protection.</span>

                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">
                    <a href="e5z" type="MemberSpeech">
                      <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Senator SIEWERT</span>
                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Western Australia</span>—<span class="HPS-MinisterialTitles">Australian Greens Whip</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">20:23</span>):  I rise tonight to also contribute to the debate on the Social Security Legislation Amendment (Youth Jobs Path: Prepare, Trial, Hire) Bill that was introduced in 2016. This bill contains two measures that relate to the Youth Jobs PaTH Program, announced in the 2016-17 budget. These include the exemption of the fortnightly incentive payment of $200 from being counted as income so as to not affect the income support payments of the internship participants and the suspension of income support for up to 26 weeks for young people hired under a youth bonus wage subsidy so that they are not required to reapply if they find themselves unemployed through no fault of their own within the 26-week period. I will come back to that through-no-fault-of-their-own clause.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The Greens will not be supporting the passage of this legislation. We have a number of concerns with this legislation. Our key concerns with the PaTH program are related to: the limited remuneration the internship participants would receive; the possibility of existing employees being displaced and 'interns' being churned; the limited protections provided to the internship participants; and whether the internships are genuinely voluntary. We are also concerned that much of the PaTH program is not covered by the legislation. The bill is lacking a lot of detail. That is a key concern, as well. For example, the fortnightly incentive payment of $200 is not provided for in this bill. The Department of Employment, in answer to one of my questions on notice during the inquiry into the bill, said that this measure would not be included in legislation. This should ring alarm bells for everybody as it means that a future government, or this one, for this matter, at some point in time could decide to reduce the amount of incentive payment to be paid to internship participants.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Given we have concerns that internship participants may receive less than the minimum wage—in some cases as little as $4 an hour for their labour under the proposed parameters, the amount participants would be paid without the incentive payment or with a reduced incentive payment would not be acceptable. Because the incentive payment is not included in the legislation there is also no provision for it to be indexed over time. This means that the real value of the payment may not be maintained into the future and young jobseekers will be expected to live off even less. It would be even lower than the minimum wage.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The legislation also does not prescribe when a business hosting an 'intern' can ask the young jobseeker to work. This means the business may require an intern to work outside standard hours without having to pay them any prescribed penalty rates. This could lead to businesses overlooking existing employees for overtime or for work outside standard powers and, instead, require an intern to work. This will lead to employees conditions being undermined and interns being exploited. It could also lead to existing employees being displaced for interns, as the business will be in receipt of a youth bonus wage subsidy of up to $6,500 for intern participants that they offer an employment position to. For more disadvantaged jobseekers, this subsidy goes up to $10,000. The possibility of such displacement increases in workplaces where levels of employment fluctuate frequently and where there are a large number of casual workers, as these factors make it difficult to identify where displacement is occurring.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">There is also concern that instead of a business filling a vacancy in the workplace following an internship placement, they may just continue to engage interns under the trial stage of the PaTH program, receiving $1,000 for each intern they engage. If this happens, businesses will be abusing the public purse in order to save a few pennies. It will also undermine the highest stage of the program, which is supposed to see young jobseekers employed by the businesses they intern with. We are not convinced that the checking processes will be adequate to identify this churn process. The bottom line is that youth unemployment should not be used as an excuse to provide cheap labour sources for business. This is a poor way to address the fact that there simply are not enough jobs for young people.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">One way to ensure the participants are paid minimum wage would be to limit the number of hours internship participants could work in a fortnight. It is proposed at 50 hours. It would need to be kept at 30 hours to meet minimum wage standards. There should also be rules around when intern participants can work to ensure that they are not pressured into working non-standard hours.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The Australian Greens are deeply concerned about the lack of protections provided in the legislation and, otherwise, to intern participants because they are not classified as employees. The health and safety protections for the participants are, in our opinion, inadequate. Given the participants are not employees, it is possible they will not be covered by laws governing health and safety in the states and territories. There are concerns regarding insurance cover that will apply to the participants, including that it will not be to the same level of cover as is provided to employees under the schemes of the states and territories.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">As ACOSS said in its submission to the inquiry into this bill:</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">The Department has its own scheme for participants in employment programs but we understand this generally providers lesser benefits than State Workers Compensation schemes, no periodic payments, and no entitlement to rehabilitation.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">In this regard it is necessary that internship participants have access to adequate compensation cover in the event of an accident. The department's current cover for employment program participants is inadequate, in the view of the Australian Greens. We have seen the problems with Work for the Dole. As an aside, I am pleased the government has recognised that Work for the Dole has been an inadequate, unsuccessful program and cut it back quite a bit, but this program is not an adequate alternative.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">There is also the question of whether the internships are genuinely voluntary. This is a really important point because it is a point that the government stresses. I have raised concerns about this previously, including at estimates last year. We are concerned that young jobseekers may be forced to include an internship placement in their plan. They would be required to do that by their jobactive service provider, meaning that the young jobseeker might face penalties if they did not comply with the requirements of their plan.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The government has legislation—one of its many pieces of legislation around jobseeker compliance—where people would possibly subject to further penalties if they did not agree to their job plan. If job service providers say something should be part of a job plan, what leg do young people have to stand on in the event that they disagree? There is nothing in the bill before us today to alleviate this concern. Nowhere does it state that placements are voluntary and there will be no penalties for failing to attend or withdrawing from a placement. This also rings alarm bells because it means a future government, or in fact this government at some later stage, could decide to make the trial stage of the PaTH program mandatory or dispense penalties to young jobseekers who fail to comply with the government's wishes.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">In their submission to the inquiry into the bill, the Multicultural Youth Advocacy Network Australia and the Federation of Ethnic Communities Councils of Australia raised concerns regarding the authority some migrants and refugees confer upon service providers acting for the government, and the potential for those migrants and refugees to 'regard the presentation of what is actually a voluntary option as a requirement that must be followed'. It is imperative that it is appropriately communicated to all potential internship participants that the trial stage of the PaTH program is voluntary and they can choose whether or not they wish to participate.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">A number of other measures have been left out of the legislation. These include any details regarding the Prepare stage of the PaTH program, a definition of the term 'internship', any details about penalties for the displacement of existing employees and/or churn of interns, and an evaluation strategy for the PaTH program. All the measures outlined so far should have been included in the bill to ensure that they are scrutinised properly and subject to legislation. We need to be able to scrutinise those measures that have been left out but were clearly outlined by government as part of this program. By excluding them from the legislation, the government is keeping the details of the PaTH program hidden from the parliament, in the sense that we cannot scrutinise them properly. Nor can we ask questions, and the public are not able to comment on that process officially. Given its potential to impact young people significantly, this detail should be in the legislation and the information should be publicly available.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I note that the majority committee report of the inquiry into the bill says that the Department of Employment is adjusting the design of the Prepare stage of the PaTH program based on the feedback it received to its discussion paper on that stage. It is a shame that feedback was not requested on the other two stages of the PaTH program. Based on the submissions to the inquiry into the bill, I imagine a number of concerns would have been brought to the department's attention. The PaTH program focuses on the employability of young people, which demonstrates that the PaTH program is another example where the government is ignoring the real problem, and that is the lack of available jobs for young people.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We know from Anglicare Australia's jobs availability snapshot, published just last year, that there were 6.33 people for every low-skilled job available in May last year. The situation is even worse in Tasmania and South Australia, where there were 9.39 and 10.62 people respectively for every low-skilled job. This alone disproves the government's rhetoric that if jobseekers just tried hard enough they would be able to get a job. Jobseekers are disproportionately affected by the lack of low-skilled, entry-level jobs, as they often have limited work experience. Those from regional areas, migrants and refugees have it tougher still. The government's response by way of this PaTH program is unlikely to lead to the creation of the new jobs that are so desperately needed in order to provide ongoing employment opportunities for young people. This program employs people for less than the minimum wage in areas where there simply are not enough jobs. What example does it set for young people when we push them out into these so-called internships for below the minimum wage?</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The PaTH program is not a novel idea either. It has been based in part on two programs from overseas: the UK YES scheme and the Irish JobBridge program. Both of these schemes have had significant problems, and the Irish scheme has been discontinued. I understand there have been significant problems with the UK scheme and significant changes. This does not provide us with much hope for the success of the PaTH program, particularly given the unfavourable outcomes of the Irish JobBridge program, where participants were exploited and existing workers were displaced. I personally had an example given to me of a young woman who was displaced from a job in the UK under the UK scheme. The Greens have raised concerns that the PaTH program is destined to experience the same outcomes.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The government has cut funding to genuine apprenticeships and is now putting in place this poor substitute to proper training. It should instead be investing in wraparound, individualised supports and quality training programs. Reinvesting the money cut from apprenticeships in the VET system would be a step in the right direction. It should also abandon its enduring plans to throw young people off income support for four weeks plus the ordinary waiting period, which is five weeks. This place has shown time and again that it does not support this policy, and yet the government still will not abandon it. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">When the government talks about a young person leaving a job 'through no fault of their own', this is another poorly defined example of 'through no fault of their own'. Young people, if they are being bullied and harassed in work, if they are being asked to do unreasonable activities, if they are being asked to work non-standard hours, it is highly likely that they will be worried and scared and might leave that job, and will that be defined as 'through no fault of their own'?</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The unfortunate part is that, the longer the government waits to act in relation to youth unemployment and to genuinely develop the jobs that young people can go into it, the worse it is going to get. Youth unemployment will continue to grow until policy settings are corrected to enable an alternative outcome. If the government does not act soon, they will be locking this generation out of secure work for a long time to come. More and more young people, and also as they grow older, are continuing in temporary, insecure, part-time work rather than secure, longer term work. That is what we are locking this future generation into. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We will have many questions in the committee stage because, as I said, this legislation only implements a part of the PaTH program. It also does not guarantee the $200 into the future. There is no indexation there. We are not convinced by the government's responses to the question of what they are going to do about addressing issues like churn, like ensuring that existing employees are not put off so that younger people—being paid less than the minimum wage while doing 'training' and getting work experience—can have a job. </span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">If I was working in one of those areas that are likely to take on these internships, I would be very worried about my future employment, because, if an employer can get a younger person, get $1,000 and get a worker much cheaper, that is probably going to be incentive enough, for some of these businesses that will only take these people on, for existing employees to lose their jobs and be replaced by these interns. </span>

                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">It is good that the government is looking at how they can address youth unemployment and get experience for young workers, but this is highly likely to result in young people, young workers, being exploited and does not address the issue of jobs into the future. It does not develop new jobs into the future. When you have 6.33 people applying for each job, it is quite depressing, and this does not fix that. </span>

                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">

                      <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Senator CAROL BROWN</span>
                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Tasmania</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">20:41</span>):  I rise to speak on the Social Security Legislation Amendment (Youth Jobs Path: Prepare, Trial, Hire) Bill 2016. I want to say at the outset that I believe this legislation to establish the Youth Jobs PaTH program is, as many other speakers before me have indicated, poorly constructed, and I fear that it will place young Australian jobseekers at risk of exploitation. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Doing all we can to provide young people with opportunities to find work will always be worthy of our time and consideration in this place. Youth unemployment is a huge problem. In my home state of Tasmania we have among the highest rates of youth unemployment in Australia. In some parts of Tasmania the unemployment rate among 15- to 24-year-olds is as high as 27 per cent. We have a youth unemployment crisis. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We are failing our young people. The Liberals' youth PaTH program will put young jobseekers at risk and is fundamentally flawed in its approach to addressing youth unemployment. The program does not create additional jobs for young Australians. It merely places our young people on temporary internships without proper wages or conditions. Labor believes that the pathway to good, well-paid and secure jobs for young jobseekers is best done through investing in early childhood education, university and TAFE and genuine experiences that come from traineeships and apprenticeships. We want programs that genuinely help our young people find work. But this legislation that is before us here tonight does not provide sufficient safeguards for young people, who are among the most vulnerable workers in today's labour market. It has many, many deficiencies.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">There is, as has already been said in the debate here tonight, very little detail on just how the Prepare Trial Hire program, the PaTH program, will operate in practice. While I understand the need for flexibility, too much is left to regulation and administrative discretion. You would think that the government would have tried to get such important legislation right. You would think that the government would have tried to get this legislation right. But, while they talk about jobs, they do not have a very good record on creating jobs. We know that the Work for the Dole scheme has not had much success. On the government's own figures, nearly 90 per cent of participants in the Work for the Dole scheme are not in full-time work three months after completing the program. We must not see a situation where young unemployed Australians are given false hope and work for under award wages. This program does not create additional jobs; instead, it will subsidise employers to hire interns who will not have sufficient protections. We have heard about that in this debate tonight.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">These shortcomings and the many concerns from a range of community groups were outlined in submissions to the Senate's Education and Employment Legislation Committee received in the short amount of time the committee was given to look at this legislation. In their dissenting report, Labor senators noted that the government had not provided adequate legislative support to assure members or the community that this program will operate well. Labor's dissenting report made five recommendations, including that the bill not be supported in its current form until the genuine concerns about the overall program have been completely addressed. As I have said, there are many concerns about this legislation and, if it was to be passed in its present form, it would see a flawed program come into effect. We want to do everything that we can to improve the job skills of young people, but this program falls well short. We must take note of these concerns and act on them. The government wants to rush this program through this place, and that was highlighted when the Senate committee refused to hold public hearings into this legislation.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">One of the major concerns about this program is that the payments that would be received by participants would be well below the national minimum wage. Participants would be paid an extra $100 a week on top of income support. This would mean they would be performing work in companies making a profit, but they would be earning less than the national minimum wage. As the submission to the Senate committee from the Australian Council of Social Service noted:</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">Payment rates and hours of work for the internships mean that many people will work for less than (the equivalent of) the minimum wage:</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-SmallBullet" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-SmallBullet">Since participants will be working whether 'employed' or not, they should be properly remunerated.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-SmallBullet" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-SmallBullet">Fortnightly hours for internships should be capped at 30 instead of 50, so that participants are remunerated at least to the equivalent of the relevant hourly minimum wage.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">In its submission, the Australian Council of Trade Unions said that youth unemployment was one of Australia's biggest challenges and that the Youth Jobs PaTH program would be ineffective in dealing with it. The ACTU went on to say:</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">There must also be significant concern however that PaTH may serve to undermine the minimum wage system. The current program settings, hours worked and additional payments per fortnight, mean that the interns in this program are paid below minimum wage, potentially creating pressure on existing employees' wages or conditions. The ACTU is concerned that the scheme may encourage employers to replace existing minimum wage workforces with government sponsored interns or to reduce their wages or conditions. Interns are not paid superannuation or subject to worker's compensation and so represent a significant saving to employers when compared to regular employees.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The ACTU was also very fearful about the exploitation of vulnerable young people by unscrupulous employers. It feared that many young people may receive little or poor training on the job and that, when they finish their poorly-paid internship, they would be no more employable than they were when they started. The ACTU was worried that employers may take on many interns just to get the $1,000 sign-up fee. The union body also detailed a similar scheme in the United Kingdom, and we have heard about this in the debate that has thus far been held tonight. The United Kingdom scheme, launched in 2013, was ended 18 months later with fewer than half the estimated placements being made and with no clear increase in real job placements, but here we are in Australia with the minister putting forward a program that is clearly lacking. A number of concerns have been expressed by community groups and the labour movement, and this government is moving forward with no response to the concerns that have been put forward.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Jobs Australia also raised concerns with the minimal rate of pay. It pointed out that all Australian workers are legally entitled to receive the minimum wage and that, if this does not happen, young people in the program would be at increased risk of being exploited. Jobs Australia recommended that the payment should be legislated fully and not in the undefined manner of the legislation before us today.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I want to turn now to the inadequate protections in the bill. There are concerns that young people who take part in the Youth Jobs PaTH program may not be adequately covered by state workers' compensation and other legislated workplace protections. As I understand this legislation before us, interns will be classified as volunteers, despite the fact that they will perform work tasks, and this throws their protections into doubt. It is vital that a program designed to put 120,000 young jobseekers into workplaces has adequate protections for them. The Australian Council of Social Service said:</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">There is no legislative assurance that the health and safety of participants in the internships will be adequately protected …</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">     …      …      …</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-SmallBullet" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-SmallBullet">The Department has its own scheme for participants in employment programs but we understand this generally provides lesser benefits than State Workers Compensation schemes, no periodic payments, and no entitlement to rehabilitation.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-SmallBullet" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-SmallBullet">Either participants should be covered by State Workers Compensation scheme or equivalent coverage should be negotiated by the Department.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The bill before us and the trial stage of the PaTH program seek to introduce government subsidised internships. Yet they fail to give legal definition to the term 'intern'. Labor, along with a number of organisations, believes this is problematic. Uniting Care Australia noted in their submission that they are concerned about how these internships will be viewed and treated in employment terms. Interns Australia were worried that, because the term 'intern' is not defined in Australian employment law, there would be great confusion about the rights of participants in the Youth Jobs PaTH program. This gives us nothing but uncertainty in regard to the legal rights and legal consequences that may affect young people and workforces. It fails to prescribe the standards and workplace protections that are offered to ordinary Australian workers. As highlighted in the submission made by Interns Australia:</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">If interns are to be considered as legally different to employees, their rights must be clearly stated.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Failing to give clear definition to the terms under the scheme creates an environment of great vulnerability for young workers.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal"> Labor will not stand by while young interns may be required to undertake the same work as other employees for little or no pay, where there is no further skill, training or education on offer. Already, we have seen many employers and industries adopt the trend of offering young people internships that do not have clearly defined employment relationships. As parents and as members of this place, we should be incredibly cautious about this trend, which is fast becoming part of a widespread culture in Australian workplaces. Many of these emerging internships are unpaid and target vulnerable young people with little or no experience in the paid workforce.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">As I said previously, the bill in its current form is poorly constructed. In particular, it does nothing to address the 'churn and burn'—which we heard about in previous contributions tonight—of young workers by employees and businesses, which allows them to exploit one worker after the other to milk the program for their benefit. Instead, it provides both financial incentives through subsidies, and vulnerable labour to workplaces to exploit. These concerns were highlighted by Interns Australia, who noted that many employers under the program would be encouraged to hire an individual and receive a subsidy, only to terminate their agreement in order to hire someone else and receive the subsidy again.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal"> On top of this, the government has still failed to explain how they will prevent employers from churning through interns every 12 weeks. The Liberals' Youth Jobs PaTH Program may cause systemic, long-term and cultural damage to the job market for other young jobseekers. To allow this to happen would be a betrayal of our young people. ACOSS have made clear their concerns, saying that the 'internship positions created under this program are likely to displace paid jobs for other young people'.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Mr Acting Deputy President, I know you are very familiar with the Liberal Party policies at the last federal election. During the election campaign the government talked about the jobs and growth that they would create. Regrettably, it was all talk. They have failed dismally. The problem is not just unemployment but also underemployment. As the Australian Unemployed Workers Union pointed out in their submission to the Senate inquiry, it is not a matter of making young people more employable; it is about having the jobs for them. It said:</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">Currently according to the most recent data collected by the Australian Bureau of Statistics and the Department of Employment, there are 19 job seekers competing for every job vacancy. When you consider low-skill jobs— the sort of jobs young unemployed Australians will most realistically be considered for—this rate is even higher. Clearly, it is this dearth of low-skill jobs in the Australian labour market that has been the leading cause for Australia's youth unemployment crisis. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">It is clear we have a youth unemployment crisis. The Liberals' Youth Jobs PaTH Program is a path to nowhere. There are over 260,000 young people unemployed in Australia. These young jobseekers need real support and real solutions. The creation of opportunities for young people in the workplace, however, is never achieved through exploitation. I doubt that this program will see any more young people getting full-time work. In fact, if you look at the record of the Abbott-Turnbull government, you will see programs that they have implemented or raised as an option that have not worked. They do not work. This, again, is a program that will not see any more young people getting full-time work. I fear it will put young jobseekers, who are already vulnerable, in positions where they will be exploited. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">In drawing my contribution to a close, I will outline the main concerns the Labor Party has with the bill before us. There is no firm definition of an intern. The participant is likely to have only a reasonable prospect of a job. A large number of participants could be used within companies at the one time, with little sanction for employers that might churn through PaTH participants after the engagement concludes. Large numbers of interns could completely negate the need for existing employees in certain sectors to work at certain times—for instance, on weekends, which would reduce access to penalty rates for these employees. PaTH participants are considered to be volunteers in some jurisdictions, and I have talked about that, as have many other senators in this debate. They are considered to be volunteers in some jurisdictions, affecting the way worker compensation systems would treat participants in the event of a workplace incident. In concluding, I fear that this bill will put young jobseekers who are already vulnerable in a position where they will be exploited, and our young people deserve better than this bill that is before us.</span>

                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">South Australia</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">21:01</span>):  Our entrenched high rate of youth unemployment is a social travesty, especially when it is a product of generational welfare dependency or leads to long-term unemployment. We can never rest in our efforts to tackle this. This Social Security Legislation Amendment (Youth Jobs Path: Prepare, Trial, Hire) Bill is a positive step in helping alleviate this by putting in place formal steps, incentives and protections. We are therefore supportive of it in principle, particularly given that the government could implement this program without legislative reform. If the government went down that path, it would mean the fortnightly incentive payments the scheme provides to participants will be treated as additional income and taxed accordingly. It would also potentially impact their Centrelink payments. This would undermine the intention of helping the jobseeker afford the costs that come with applying for or starting a new job.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">As it stands, the PaTH program aims to give underskilled young people the abilities and confidence they need to approach a potential employer and secure a job. This is a modest ambition perhaps but one which, for some of these young people, probably seems unattainable. It is something other people can do, not them. The program provides eligible young jobseekers with intensive job-hunting and interview preparation training, followed by a short internship placement. It provides $200 a fortnight to offset travel and other job related costs, such as appropriate work wear, and it provides incentives for employers to take a chance and hire someone with no experience and little to recommend them other than a willingness to succeed. We think this is a very good start.</span>
                </p>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">If it is well implemented and well used, the youth jobs PaTH program will also benefit businesses by linking them to enthusiastic young people willing to learn and who can grow with the business. These are all positives in our book, but we do have a few concerns and will seek assurances on these from the minister during the committee stage of the bill. For instance, the 26-week suspension of a young jobseeker's income support may become problematic as this is also how long the wage subsidies to an employer will run. We know that most employers will engage with this program for the right reasons, but we have also seen too many instances in recent times where major youth employers, such as Grill'd, 7-Eleven and Pizza Hut, have underpaid staff and appear to view young people not as a valued resource but as a source of expendable cheap labour.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Whatever safeguards we put in place, there will undoubtedly be employers who will be lured by the subsidy on offer and will be intent on exploiting it. This makes the 26-week period for both the duration of the subsidy and the young employee's income support suspension problematic in instances where the employer takes on an intern as cheap labour and then dumps them soon after the wage subsidy ends. To avoid disadvantaging young people who have entered these positions with the best intentions, we would prefer to see the suspension period for income support extended beyond 26 weeks. Nine to 12 months would be appropriate if they remain employed with the same eligible employer. This small change would avoid vulnerable young people having to reapply for their income support and serve out a waiting period should they lose their job through no fault of their own after the 26-week suspension period ends.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Given these jobseekers are not classified as employees and, in many cases, may be ignorant of their rights, there is potential for the jobseeker to be exploited in other ways too—for example, by being asked to work excessive or non-standard hours or undertake potentially risky tasks without sufficient training. We would expect that each jobseeker's training will include instructions on their rights as well as their obligations in the workplace and anticipate that the minister will provide a guarantee that this will be the case. We will also be seeking assurances that providers will work with young people to determine what industries or roles appeal to them, even in the face of a 'dunno', and steer them towards suitable internships that will spark their interest and keep them engaged in their new-found job.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">While the scheme will be voluntary, it is important that this does not become simply a placement program where jobseekers are just slotted into available positions without due consideration of their aspirations. While many people view employment as black and white, that a job is a job and that you should be thankful for anything you can get, the reality is people do not tend to stay in jobs when they are unhappy. We should not set these young people up for inadvertent failure by pushing them into training and a job in which they have no interest or desire to engage. To do this would be a waste of taxpayers' $752 million investment in the program. For this program to have the best chance of success, we must not only empower these young people with enhanced skills and confidence about their ability to win and keep a job but also importantly ignite their passion by helping steer them towards industries and jobs where they can see themselves in the long term. We want these jobseekers to feel inspired to keep building their skills and create previously unimagined career paths that ideally will keep them off benefits and help break the suffocating cycle of intergenerational welfare dependency that so often only serves to steal the aspirations and futures of our young people.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">In closing, this bill has the potential to change the life path of young people for the better. That said, it is crucial that we do not take our eyes off the ball once the scheme is up and running. To that end, I indicate that I intend to move an amendment to have the program reviewed within two years to ensure there are no unforeseen and harmful circumstances.</span>

                      <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Senator McKENZIE</span>
                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Victoria</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">21:07</span>):  It gives me great pleasure to rise tonight to speak on the government's Social Security Legislation Amendment (Youth Jobs Path: Prepare, Trial, Hire) Bill 2016. I think this is one of the hallmark aspects of our government's agenda in our commitment to reducing youth unemployment across this country. I think all submitters to the Senate inquiry are absolutely united in acknowledging the scourge that is youth unemployment, particularly for those young people located in regional Australia, where unemployment rates are much, much higher than they are in urban areas. And when you go out and speak to employers, when you speak to young people, when you speak to careers teachers in schools and across universities, one of the key reasons for young people finding it hard to get secure ongoing employment is the fact that they lack the requisite work experience in the particular area or industry in which they are seeking to set out a career path.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Indeed, that is what is key and at the heart of this particular policy initiative—ensuring that young people actually get the work experience they need in the area they are interested in and that employers are incentivised to take on that young person, who may not have the full skill set required to fulfil that task. Employers, equally, are supported so that the young person can get experience, because finding your way as a young Australian, or a young person anywhere, through the myriad study options and employment options can be a tangled path, a long and winding road. Many young people, as we have seen with our university data, think that a particular course is going to provide them with satisfaction and ongoing enjoyment. However, once they embark on that course they find that it is actually not for them and they go on to find another course that will fulfil their particular needs and interests.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">So, too, it is for employment. Giving young people the opportunity to participate in industries and areas that they may not have come across in their particular region or school setting will I think lead to increased employability of all young Australians. So, I completely support the minister and really appreciate her bringing this initiative forward, because at least we are doing something. </span>

                      <span class="HPS-MemberContinuation">Senator McKENZIE:</span>
                    </a>  You want to talk about apprenticeships—and Senator Cameron, I am happy to have that conversation anytime you like—but your government ripped millions out of apprenticeship programs and indeed in your own campaign documents actually had no budgeted forward estimates for what you had put back in. At least we are actually looking at creative and innovative ways that we can get young people right across the country those key skill sets they need to be employed and to contribute—and not just to contribute to the national economy and pay their taxes and go to work each day but to actually enjoy it. That is why getting out there and having a crack is important.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">PaTH is about preparing young people, giving them the opportunity to trial different work options, and then hopefully that young person and the employer will have a meeting of minds and the young person will be offered an ongoing job, which this program supports employers to do—to offer a wage subsidy should that young person fulfil the employer's needs in an ongoing way. I find it quite disingenuous that the Greens are not supporting this initiative. They are out there trying to ramp up a $50-a-week increase to the Newstart allowance. This program offers a $100-a-week increase in the Newstart allowance plus valuable work experience that will assist that young person going forward.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">When we were looking at preparing young Australians we were wanting to increase their employability skills training to help them understand the behaviours that are expected by employers in the workplace, which will provide tailored industry-specific training that will prepare our young people going into jobs. We are offering voluntary internships for up to 12 weeks to give our youth a chance to show what they can do in a real, live workplace. And then, as I mentioned, there is a new youth bonus wage subsidy to support the employment of young people. The government is committed to addressing youth unemployment by assisting vulnerable young Australians who are at risk of falling into the welfare trap at an early stage in their lives. You leave school, you are looking around for options, you are not quite sure where life will take you. This program is exactly designed to assist that young person who is not quite sure what the future offers them a pathway to ongoing, sustainable employment. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We recognise that some young people require additional assistance in getting those relevant work-ready skills that they need, and this initiative is backed by data and evidence. As I said, I chaired the Senate inquiry into this bill, and all 15 submitters are committed to addressing the scourge of youth unemployment and commented on our budget allocation of $850 million to the youth employment package. This package was developed by the department though a consultation process in which we went out to the community, to a range of stakeholders, and sought their comments on our program, and we incorporated that in the final package.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The Australian Chamber of Commerce and Industry submitted that it strongly supports the Youth Jobs Path initiative 'as an important avenue to secure jobs for young unemployed Australians'. And I think we all acknowledge that this program will give young people real-job work experience. It is not just some tick and flick. It is not just some tokenistic effort. This is about placing young people with real employers so that they can get that hands-on experience.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The Brotherhood of St Lawrence also supported the bill and made some key recommendations. They commented on how rapidly the modern employment environment is changing within Australia and across our economy. It is profoundly testing for a significant proportion of young people—around 30 per cent of young people. The youth unemployment rate sits at double the rate of overall unemployment. As I said, all submitters, including ACOSS, are committed to addressing the issue. The government is to be commended for putting something on the table for consideration.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I want to address a couple of the criticisms that those opposite have raised. One of them was that there is not a decent wage and that is primarily because interns are actually interns. They are not employed as Australian workers. I do not hear anybody opposite critiquing any of the universities in this country that have embedded internship programs in their coursework requirements. University see internships as a valuable opportunity for young people to gain skills and experience in their chosen industry. Why won't you accept that this is an opportunity for young people to trial something that may be of interest to them? I will clarify the payment issue: the $200 fortnightly incentive paid to PaTH interns is on top of their income support. The incentive is paid by the government and is not a wage. If a host organisation paid a PaTH intern, the internship would cease immediately because—you know what?—it would become a job; it would not be an internship. That is the difference.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Senator Brown mentioned the churn culture and the submission from the Department of Employment went exactly to the heart of that by setting out measures to protect against the churn in the PaTH program. They include: </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">… program guidelines, in combination with the jobactive Deed 2015-2020 and the Transition to Work Deed 2016-2020, to make clear to employment service providers the parameters of the program. Department of Employment monitoring activities will help ensure that host organisations appropriately use the program. … The department's program assurance strategy will be applied to PaTH internships. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">In addition the department currently provides program assurance of employment services through a range of prevention, deterrence and detection and correction methods, and these will similarly be applied to the PaTH program.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I think it is quite disappointing when we look at what the alternatives may be. There has been a lot of brouhaha recently around the value or otherwise of internships. I would remind Mr Shorten that he does not mind the odd intern; the Greens, either internationally or here, at home do not mind the odd intern; Lisa Chesters and Brendan O'Connor do not mind the odd intern. In fact many parliamentarians—</span>

                    </a>  There you go. Thank you for that interjection—I will take that interjection from the good minister. Not only do interns gain valuable experience, but they can also provide valuable support to employers or, in this case, the parliamentarians they serve. We have heard a lot about class warfare particularly from Senator Cameron earlier. It is a tired old argument by Labor. I don't know why it is okay for those who are in Young Labor and who are moving up in the world to get priority internships in ministers' or shadow ministers' offices in the Labor Party or are spokespeople with the Greens, but it is not okay for country kids to head down to their local manufacturer to get some decent work experience. It is not okay for other young Australians who are experiencing chronic unemployment in their regions to get the work experience that they need. It is okay for the political class if you are from the Left, but it is not okay for others across the economy.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I would call on both the Greens and Labor to support this innovative initiative by the government. I hope we are all troubled by the tragedy of youth unemployment in this country. We need our existing programs and we need to grow and develop our economy so that jobs are available locally. We also need to recognise that some young people in our communities need that additional support. This program goes to the heart of addressing that—what those young people need to go out there and secure job in what can be a very daunting scenario for them as they leave school. I commend the bill to the Senate.</span>

                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Tasmania</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">21:19</span>):  What do you do when you cannot keep your promise to tackle youth unemployment? Well, this government opens young people up to exploitation to their mates in big business instead. This government has comprehensively failed the youth of Australia. At the moment, there are almost 300,000 young Australians between the ages of 15 and 24 out of work. That is a shocking statistic. Youth unemployment has climbed to 13.3 per cent—well over double the general unemployment rate. Many of these young people have been unemployed for more than a year and are understandably disillusioned by the act of looking for jobs that simply are not there. On top of this, 20 per cent of young people are underemployed—they want to work more hours but there are simply no opportunities to obtain extra hours.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This is just disgraceful and is indicative of a pattern of neglect by this government towards young Australians. They have a lot to be disappointed about from this government. Whether it is the Centrelink robo-debt disaster, $100,000 degrees, the unaffordability of housing or the bill we are debating today, the government has really let them down. The government knew that it had no policies to help young people. That is why they threw this rushed policy into the last budget. It was a hastily cobbled together program, announced at the time of the 2016 federal budget to make it sound like they are doing something for young people, but in reality it only helps their mates. It is a thought bubble that may look good at first glance, but has been terribly implemented. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The bill before us today is designed in part to support the introduction of the Turnbull government's Prepare and Trial, Hire program or PaTH. PaTH is supposedly designed to prepare young people for work by providing jobseekers aged 17 to 24 with pre-employment training and placement in voluntary internships of four to 12 weeks. During that time, they may work between 15 to 25 hours a week. Jobseekers will receive payments of $200 a fortnight on top of their current income support payments, while they are participating in the PaTH program. Businesses will be paid $1,000 to take on an intern and then receive a wage subsidy of between $6,500 and $10,000 if they hire them at the conclusion of their internship.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The government is expecting the program will take effect from April 2017. I and my Labor colleagues and many others in our community have serious concerns about whether this program represents a fair deal for Australia's young unemployed. The PaTH program is being introduced at the same time that other government job programs such as the Work for the Dole are hopelessly failing our young unemployed. In the case of Work for the Dole, even the government's own figures show nearly 90 per cent of its participants are not in full time work three months after exiting the program. The sad truth is Australia's youth are counting the cost of the Turnbull government's failure to develop a real jobs plan for the nation.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Under the PaTH program, the opposition is concerned that young people will be forced to pay an even heavier price through the program's apparent flaws. I will just take a moment to outline what the bill before us contains. The bill enacts the changes needed to provide support to participants in the program. It does this via two measures: first, a provision will be inserted in the Social Security Act and Veterans' Entitlements Act so the $200 payment interns receive is not counted as income for social security or veteran's entitlements purposes. Secondly, it amends the Social Security Act to allow young people to suspend their payments if they are employed. They can then restart them without re-applying if they lose their job through no fault of their own within 26 weeks.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Taken in isolation, the government will claim the measures in the bill are non-controversial. But the reality is they form part of a broader new program that the opposition is concerned about, which could see young jobseekers exploited and could undermine workforce standards. Chief amongst these criticisms is the fact that, unlike with Work for the Dole, for the first time participants would be placed in the private sector and would be paid below award wages. The opposition is concerned that PaTH could be used to displace jobs with cheaper labour.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">There have been very real concerns raised that participants may be working for below minimum award wages. The national minimum wage is $17.70 an hour. But an intern who works 25 hours a week and receives only their Newstart payments plus the $200 payment will earn just $14.50 an hour. This program could very well see young Australians stacking supermarket shelves for less than the minimum wage. Australians have rightly been concerned about cases of worker exploitation when events like the 7-Eleven wage scandal come to light. Why would our community stand for a government program that undercuts the minimum wage?</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This is something that is entirely within the government's power to fix. The bonus payments could be set at a rate which is equivalent to the minimum wage, or the maximum hours could be reduced to ensure this is met. But this is a government that is constantly trying to undercut rights and conditions for workers through its attacks on penalty rates, its anti-union ABCC agenda and its unfair public service bargaining framework so we will not hold our breath for them to put this right.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">At a time where wages growth is at its lowest rate on record, we are concerned that PaTH could be used to undermine wages across industries for all Australian workers. Despite repeated questioning by the opposition, there are few assurances that interns will be covered by appropriate workers compensation schemes in the event of an accident. That is because PaTH participants will be considered volunteers, not employees. In some jurisdictions this could affect the way workers compensation systems would treat participants in the event of an accident. This is simply not good enough. All workers should have the right to workers compensation should they be injured at work.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The program does not specify real areas job seekers will acquire skills. In Senate estimates last May the clearest outline of training and skill outcomes Minister Cash offered was, 'We will give you the skills that employers tell us you just do not have.' And while the program was announced in May 2016 and is scheduled to start in April 2017, the government can't even tell you how it has defined what an intern is. The government has had trouble explaining what jobseekers will be doing in the internship phase of the program, even down to the basic level: whether they would be working or just observing. '</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Large numbers of participants could be used within companies at any given time, with little sanction applied to employers that might churn through PaTH participants after the engagement concludes. Imagine what would happen if a major supermarket or fast-food chain decided it would employ tens of thousands of Interns. Large numbers of interns could also completely remove the need for existing employees in certain sectors, for example, hospitality to work at certain times. Imagine large numbers of PaTH participants being used over weekends, removing the need for regular employees at those times, and also removing the need to pay penalty rates for those employees. This program could be used in a systematic way to attack workers' ability to access penalty rates.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">There are so many holes in the program that it cannot be taken seriously unless the government can demonstrate how they will fix them. That is why Labor is calling for the legislation and the PaTH program to be deferred until those concerns are addressed. To wave PaTH and this legislation through, without demanding a better deal for young Australians, would not be fair to those young jobseekers.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The Senate Education and Employment Legislation Committee has conducted an inquiry into the bill at Labor's referral.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">There were concerns with this bill by many bodies that made submissions to the inquiry. I noticed Senator McKenzie could not quote anyone from the inquiry but I can. A number of the submissions made to the committee highlighted serious deficiencies in the PaTH framework. I would like to spend a while outlining some of the evidence given to the inquiry to highlight the flaws in the legislation. Interns Australia, the peak support and advocacy body for interns and students undertaking work placements in Australia said: 'Interns Australia does not support the... bill.' That is a pretty blunt assessment from the peak body for interns in Australia. Perhaps the government should have consulted them before the policy was announced?</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Another submitter, Jobs Australia, drew the committee's attention to the way exploitation and displacement could take place by asking vulnerable young Australians to work during unusual hours, or during times, when penalty rates would apply:</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">… to ensure that times of "work" or unpaid work experience are restricted so that interns are not required to "work" during times which would attract penalty payments under relevant awards—(the risks of exploitation and displacement of existing workers are extremely high in these circumstances and particularly in industries with highly variable levels of employment and of casual work—where it could be difficult to discern whether displacement is occurring).</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The ACTU put up the best possible scenario for the 120,000 young jobseekers who could take up the program:</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">When these concerns have been raised in the past, much has been made of analysis which will be done to detect employers who are abusing the program and prevent them from hosting further intern placements. It seems that the absolute best outcome such a system could achieve would be that thousands of vulnerable young people are only exploited, for profit, once.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I do not think that is good enough. I do not think it is good enough to wait for young workers to be exploited before acting; we should act before the program begins to ensure exploitation does not happen at all.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Anglicare Australia also gave a stunning rebuke of this program within the context of the current jobs market that continues to deteriorate for young Australians under this government:</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">In the context of a serious shortage of entry-level vacancies, we do not accept that internships alone will help many people overcome structural exclusion from the workforce. We can see no evidence that this program will do anything to ease the existing pressures created by the decreasing number of entry-level jobs. In this respect we also hold serious concerns that introducing up to 30,000 government-subsidised interns to this market will make an already grim situation worse.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">ACOSS made a point, seemingly clear to everyone except the government, that legislation is needed to protect young jobseekers:</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">There is no clear legislative protection against exploitation of interns to the extent that they are not classified as employees. Either participants should be classified as employees (with a wage subsidy) or the program should not allow work beyond standard working hours (averaged over a fixed period) or a times that would attract penalty rates of pay if the person was employed (such as weekends).</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">As I said earlier, I am concerned about the protection of the workers' rights for these young interns.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The Children and Young People with Disability submission shares my concerns about the vague definitions which leave it unclear what protections participants would receive. They said:</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">CYDA has some concerns regarding the internships component of the Youth Jobs PaTH initiative. 'Internships' have not been clearly defined within the Bill, aside from being referred to as "unpaid work experience" within the Explanatory Memorandum. It is therefore unclear how appropriate protections will be afforded for young people with regard to working conditions.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Further to this:</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">Jobs Australia noted that legislation is needed to ensure participants receive all the relevant protections that employees get, whether they are officially recognised as employees or not:</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">Other aspects of Youth Jobs PaTH internships, in addition to those set out in the Bill, should therefore be the subject of legislation which can be considered and scrutinised by the parliament, rather than being implemented by administrative means which might seek to exempt interns and the employers providing placements from the provisions of the Fair Work Act and other relevant legislated workplace protections and requirements.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I believe, rather sadly, that young people may be pressured into taking these 'internships' without understanding what their real rights are.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">ACOSS told the committee that clear requirements are needed for explaining the rights and expectations of a participant before they begin a placement, saying:</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">Employment services providers (or better still an independent mentor) should be required to explain to participants their rights in the workplace before an internship commences (both verbally and in writing), and offer advice and assistance in the event that those rights are at risk.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Finally, Jobs Australia noted that the voluntary nature of the placement phase of the program must be made extremely clear:</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">Incorporate a clear stipulation that participation in internships is voluntary and that there will be no income support penalties as a consequence of failure to attend or participate or for ceasing a placement (to ensure there are no subsequent adjustments to administrative arrangements which would result in participation being mandatory and relevant job seekers being subject to penalties).</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Unfortunately, the government has not made any real attempt to address these problems during the debate in the House or the Senate inquiry process. Many of the issues raised in the Senate inquiry process should be addressed by legislation or regulations tabled in parliament, rather than relying on assurances from government that they will do the right thing. This program the government want to implement is vague and has not been thought through properly. The only details they have released are in the flimsy glossy brochure from budget night. That is no basis for a program of this scale or importance.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">In summing up, we can and must do more to help young Australians. However the government's PaTH program is a desperate and cynical attempt to divert attention away from their poor record in generating jobs for young Australians or preparing those young Australians for work. Their Work for the Dole program is evidence of that failure. From what we can see at this point, PaTH is poorly planned, full of holes and ripe for exploitation. As we can see from the now defunct green army debacle, this government has absolutely no idea about creating policies that help young people enter the workforce. It could leave thousands of young Australians working for below the minimum wage before being thrown onto the scrap heap to be replaced by another cohort of below-minimum-wage labour. It could see injured young workers unjustly left with no recourse to the compensation entitlements that other workers enjoy. The Turnbull government has failed to address the concerns the community has about this hastily put together PaTH program that, as I said, has more holes than the Midland Highway. I call upon the Senate not to pass the legislation at this time.</span>

                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Queensland</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">21:36</span>):  As a servant of the people of Queensland and Australia I want to lay bare this window-dressing. The more we tax and regulate things the less we actually get of them. Someone has to pay a tax for this subsidy to work. I can speak on the benefits of an internship to my own son when he was 21 years of age. He took the initiative to get an internship in the United States in a field in which he had done some study but had not actually worked. Because of that six months of study and the success that he gave that company a few months later they offered him a full-time job at a very good salary for someone with his qualifications. So, I get the concept of an internship. But what we need to understand here is that this is simply a subsidy to make work, and not a fulfilling job. My son Shane had a very fulfilling job and he went to work and did real work every day. Taxation, though, is killing employment in this country. So let's get away from the window-dressing and get to the core issues that we face.</span>

                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Our constituents in Queensland and across Australia repeat this same comment: taxation is killing employment. Why do we tax payroll? We all know in this country that when we tax something we decrease its use. So why are we taxing payroll? It is bizarre. I had a meeting with Dave Oliver, the head of the ACTU, who seems like a nice bloke. We went round the room talking and I asked him what his main themes were and he talked about compliance and raising wages. I asked him in all sincerity if he was aware that when a person gets an increase in take-home pay it requires an even greater increase in gross pay and that, combined with regulations, is driving employment down. That is not to say that people do not deserve higher incomes, but they must be earned in a way that increases productivity. But the taxation system is killing productivity in this country. Every time Dave Oliver is successful in getting a gross pay raise it kills a job if there is not the matching productivity, and the taxation system makes it very difficult for people to be productive.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We have fine workers in this country. I know from my own experience being an underground coal miner and an open cut coal miner managing people in this country and overseas that our workers are among the best in the world. They are very committed, have a lot of initiative and take great pride in their work. But when taxation is killing their employer it is difficult to sustain work.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I am wondering what will be taxed next. PAYE tax is killing jobs and payroll tax is killing jobs. Will we tax the air that we breathe? Oh, I'm sorry, that's right: we are already taxing the air we breathe. The carbon dioxide in the air is being taxed, thanks to the Liberal-National coalition putting in place an emissions trading scheme by name. To those who deny its existence, if it quacks like a duck, waddles like a duck and looks like a duck, it is a duck. There is an emissions trading scheme in place in this country now. It started on 1 July last year.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">At this time in Australia we are facing increasing competition from the United States. President Trump is going to cut tax. He is not just going to fiddle with it; he is going to cut company and personal taxes dramatically. Then we have the other side of the issue, and that is the waste of taxpayer funds. Here we are going to have a subsidy that is going to require more taxpayer funds, and that will increase taxes or cut back other services. How many jobs will be destroyed in this country to pay for this window-dressing?</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Moving from the complexity of our taxation system, let's look at the complexity of our regulatory system. Again, we all know that the more we regulate things the less you get of them. We have red tape—the bureaucracy. Everyone is familiar with that. It is choking our industry and choking our employment. Then we have green tape—pseudo-environmentalism gone mad. And, yes, we see people agreeing and almost everyone understands what green tape does: pseudo-environmentalism and fancy campaigns dressed up—they are just political games.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Then, we have another colour emerging in this country. It actually has been underway for 20 years or more: blue tape. Blue tape is the bureaucracy that has been brought in by the UN. We have the UN pushing biodiversity, in which fungus, plants, critters, bunks and animals are treated as superior to humans and given priority to humans. And in the name of biodiversity farmers and coastal residents have their land and property rights stolen. That is a cost to industry. Just ask the farmers of Queensland who have had their farmers' property rights stolen. Then we have another form of blue tape from the UN: sustainability. The funny thing is that according to the UN their sustainability programs are sustainable only with subsidies, meaning they are not sustainable. That is how they get in place regulations to take control of people's lives: where we can live, what we can do, what we cannot do, how we can travel, how we can eat—almost everything is in their sights. Then we have the UN's climate change claims, never based on empirical evidence. The UN's latest report contains, just as the previous reports contained, one core chapter claiming warming and attributing it to human production of carbon dioxide. Nowhere in that chapter is there any empirical evidence that human sourced carbon dioxide affects the climate and needs to be cut. Nowhere in its key chapter is there any evidence—no evidence anywhere in their reports—and yet all the groups in this parliament have swallowed that myth. The RET is based on that myth—killing industry and killing jobs. More window-dressing so as to appear to be doing the right thing by our planet when it is actually harming the environment, harming the creation of jobs and harming people's lifestyles. Again, tens of billions of dollars have been wasted on window-dressing and people in this Senate know when I am looking at them that there is no evidence to support it. This window-dressing then creates pretend jobs.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Let's get back to basics. Let's look at our immigration quantity and cut it back so that we can increase employment through real jobs. We have people who are under-working—they are working for one hour a week and they are treated as employed. Then we have the issue of immigration, in terms of the quality—look at the 457 visas that are stealing people's jobs. Farmers across rural south-west Queensland, where I listened to people just a few weeks ago, see unemployed people in their regional towns and yet cannot get labourers—they cannot get workers. Worse, due to the taxation system and due to the regulations, mums and dads have to be the entire workforce for their farms. There is a massive investment in capital at risk in a variable market with variable weather and they have to do all the work. They cannot afford to hire anyone because of the regulations. People would love to hire people, but it just becomes too onerous with the regulations and too expensive with the taxation. And we are going to have a lot more to say about this in Pauline Hanson's One Nation as we march towards a Queensland election. Again, farmers are being hurt by window-dressing. All taxpayers are being hurt by window-dressing.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">In this specific bill, where is the value for money? We have an apprenticeship scheme, which the leader of our party, Senator Hanson, will be discussing in more detail. But I ask now: where is the cost-benefit analysis for this bill? Why does the government expect us to merely pass this bill when it has given us no cost-benefit analysis, no financial and economic analysis, no financial and economic justification and not even some qualitative justification? We cannot even understand the thinking that goes on. How can they possibly convince people and sell people on this when there is no salesmanship going on? Where is the accountability that comes from having a cost-benefit analysis that not only justifies expenditure but then enables something to be measured against it? The government has rarely given any cost-benefit analysis, and yet that is its fundamental responsibility. The people in the Labor Party and the Labor Party and Greens coalition were even worse at this—again, window-dressing and no cost-benefit analysis. We need to stand up for taxpayers in this country, and that is what we are doing. We are calling out the government and the opposition parties for putting our country, after seven decades, in a deplorable position—more window-dressing. That is what we see: decades of window-dressing.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">And then we come across the ultimate window-dressing. I touched on it a minute ago. We are wrecking energy in this country. We are wrecking the energy industry and that is wrecking all industries—service industries, manufacturing industries, rural industries and mining industries. On an app we can get the cost of electricity on any one day at any one time. Today we have Queensland, the state with the best quality coal reserves in the world, abundant quantities of coal, and it has an electricity price of $13,000 per megawatt hour. That is mimicking South Australia. And while we are doing that we sending electricity south to New South Wales because the pseudo-markets that have been created by both sides of politics in this country are destroying and enabling people to game the system. South Australia is being destroyed. Manufacturing is being decimated in that state. Victoria is about to shut down 20 per cent of its electricity supply. What will happen then to South Australia? What will happen then to Victoria when they come looking for power from New South Wales and Queensland? Our prices will go up in Queensland. It is a disaster and it is making employment highly expensive and unreliable and making industry unreliable. Why? Because we have subsidies piled on regulations piled on pseudo-markets piled on vested interests piled on renewable energy targets piled on renewable subsidies piled on political interference—destruction, destruction, destruction.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">And this is a reversal of history, the secret to lifting billions. It has never happened before in the history of humanity. Billions of people have been lifted out of poverty by cheap energy. It started 167 years ago with the advent of the Industrial Revolution, and the key to that was hydrocarbon fuels: coal and later oil. They provided high-quality and high-energy-density fuels that dropped the price of energy. That dramatically increased productivity, and that dramatically increased prosperity. And from that came the protection of the environment. The whales, instead of being chased to provide lighting fuel, are now secure because we have coal to provide lights. We do not have to burn the timber in the forests, because we now use coal. We now have 30 per cent more forestry area in every major developed continent, thanks to coal and oil.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We need to go back to Sir Joh's days, when energy was amongst the cheapest in the world, when business flourished and employment flourished. Instead, we get the coalition government giving us window-dressing. There is no cost-benefit analysis, no accountability and no value for money—yet another churn with the money going from the right pocket of the taxpayer into the left pocket of the taxpayer, and we have increasing underemployment. It all comes back to tax. Instead of window-dressing, let's get down to the root cause of what is keeping people out of work long-term. Let's fix the tax system. We do not support this bill.</span>
                </p>

                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Senator McCARTHY</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Northern Territory</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">21:50</span>):  Tonight, I would like to speak on a significant event in the Northern Territory's history, or indeed in Australia's history: the bombing of Darwin in 1942. This weekend on 19 February, we will be commemorating the 75th anniversary of the bombing of Darwin. What I would like to do this evening is to just remind the Senate, if ever we needed to be reminded, of the importance of our strategic position in this country in terms of the North, but in particular to reflect on the many lives that were lost in a battle that the rest of this country is completely unaware of and never fully realised the significance of in terms of the number of casualties until well after the fact. I would like to go through a time line and take the Senate back through the history of 1941 through to 1942 and also to have a look at a royal commission that took place less than a month after the attacks occurred on Darwin.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">If we look at our time line for the bombing of Darwin, in December 1941 Japan formally enters the Second World War, declares war on Britain and the US, launches aerial attacks on Pearl Harbour, Guam and Hong Kong, and invades Malaya, the Philippines and Thailand. On 10-11 January, Japan begins its campaign in the Dutch East Indies, attacking Manado in Sulawesi, and also Borneo. By 30 January, the invasion of Ambon begins in the Dutch East Indies. Gull Force, the Australian battalion defending Ambon, surrendered four days later. On 8 February, Japan begins its invasion of Singapore. On 10, 16 and 18 February 1942, Japanese reconnaissance aircraft are seen over Darwin. On 15 February 1942, Allied military forces in Singapore surrender to the Japanese. 130,000 Allied personnel are taken prisoner, including 15,000 Australians.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">On 19 February 1942 at 9:37 am, a missionary on Bathurst Island, just north of Darwin, attempted to report a large number of aircraft heading towards Darwin, that his warning was discounted as a result of a mistaken belief that the aircraft were returning Allied aircraft. The bombing commenced at approximately 10 am on 19 February 1942, with the first wave of raiders gone by approximately 10:30 am. A second wave composed of land-based bombers arrived just before 12 pm and bombed the RAAF base for 20 minutes. Evacuation of the remaining women, children and older men took place later in the afternoon of 19 February. On 23 February, the government uses the national security regulations to put the military and control of all the Northern Territory north of Birdum.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">When the first wave hit Darwin, it consisted of some 188 Japanese aircraft launched from four aircraft carriers in the Timor Sea. This was the same carrier force which had been responsible for the attack on Pearl Harbor. The bombing commenced just before 10 am. There were 10 US Kittyhawks who attempted to intercept the Japanese bombers. All but one were shot down before they were able to engage the Japanese bombers. The second wave consisted of 54 bombers, which bombed the RAAF base just before noon. This raid lasted for approximately 20 minutes. The Japanese lost between five to eight aircraft in this raid. It is estimated that the Japanese lost between five to 10 aircraft in all the raids, but Australian losses were much higher. There were some 97 air attacks on Northern Australia during World War II. The first prisoner of war to be captured on Australian soil occurred when a Japanese Zero pilot was detained by Tiwi person on the Tiwi Islands—a First Nations person.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Of all the losses, eight ships were sunk in Darwin Harbour and 15 were damaged. Two merchant ships were sunk near Bathurst Island, just north of Darwin. At least 243 people were killed. The <span style="font-style:italic;">Northern Territory News</span> records one of the first bomb severed the wharf from the shore and killed 22 waterside workers. Nine post office workers were killed after a direct hit on the trench they were sheltering in and approximately 17 were killed on the merchant ships at Bathurst Island.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Our country did not know the extent to which Northern Australia—in particular Darwin itself, but also the Darwin through the Adelaide River region—was being bombed by the Japanese. A commission of inquiry was held in the month following the attack. This was by Mr Justice Lowe. I had a chance to have a look through our archives here in the parliament to actually have a look at what this royal commission had to say. I must say, it is certainly not like royal commissions are today. In the few minutes I have left, I will read about some of the things that Mr Justice Lowe, the commissioner of this royal commission in March 1942, had to say about the injured, the accuracy of the bombing and the warning for the raid:</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Small">There was a general consensus of opinion that the general alarm sounded proceeded the falling of the first bomb by a very short space of time, probably seconds. A warning that a large number of aircraft had been observed passing overhead at a great height over Bathurst Island and were proceeding southward, was received by the officer-in-charge of the Amalgamated Wireless Postal Radio Station at Darwin at 9.35 a.m. on the morning of the 19th February. That officer repeated the message to Royal Australian Air Force Operations at 9.37 a.m. No general alarm was given in the town until just before 10 o'clock.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Small">Evidence was given before me that according to the routine usually observed, Royal Australian Air Force Operations would communicate a message to A.C.H. (Area Command Head-quarters) and that A.C.H. would communicate to Navy and Army are to Head-quarters. Royal Australian Air Force Operations would also, in the normal routine, communicate a message to A.R.P. Head-quarters.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Small">On full consideration of the evidence, I find that the failure by Royal Australian Air Force Operations to communicate with A.R.P. Head-quarters is inexplicable. The excuse given in evidence for the delay was based upon the fact that earlier that morning a number of United States planes—P.4O's had set out, for Koepang and, meeting with adverse weather, ha d returned. Some discussion , it is said, ensued as to whether the planes referred to in the above message were the American planes returning or enemy planes, and that this discussion accounted for the greater part of the delay which ensued.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">It is quite powerful to be reading through this royal commission report from 1942.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I must just say in closing that the commissioner did point out some very positive observations about the characters of people involved. I will give you an example here:</span>

                <span class="HPS-Small">There are some observations in conclusion, which I wish to make. A prisoner in the Fanny Bay Gaol, Sinclair by name, was released with others during the raid. He had had experience of first-aid work, and according to all witnesses, performed magnificent service in the town in the treatment of the wounded. On the conclusion of this work, he reported back to the gaol, and was told that he had been released. Since the day of the raid he has performed further excellent service in Darwin, helping the police and the A.R.P. organization. His sentence still had some months to run when he was released. In view of his conduct, I recommend him for a pardon.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Small">Many acts of heroism were performed by individuals on the ships in the harbour, and on the land, particularly by the nurses in the hospital. To discriminate would be invidious, but I wish to record the fact that evidence of their conduct was brought before me.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I would just like to say that our thoughts are with all of the families of those descendants as we reflect this Sunday on the 75th anniversary of the bombing of Darwin.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">
                  <a href="265982" type="MemberSpeech">
                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Senator KAKOSCHKE-MOORE</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">South Australia</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">22:00</span>):  Last Friday, I stood in Rundle Mall with Steve, a vendor for <span style="font-style:italic;">The Big Issue</span>, to help him sell this fortnight's edition of the magazine. It was 38 degrees that day, but you would not have known it by looking at Steve. With a damp towel draped around his neck, he was upbeat and definitely up for a chat. Truth be told, we only sold one copy of the magazine in the 45 minutes I shared with him, and that sale was to my chief of staff. In hindsight, I think there were a couple of reasons why we did not break any sales records that afternoon.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">One possible explanation was the fact that Steve was very keen on having the ear of a politician. The other reason was the invisibility effect the bright yellow vests we were wearing had—and I will return to that second reason shortly. Of all the things that Steve and I chatted about that day, it was the very first thing he said to me that struck me. After shaking my hand, Steve took me directly in the eye and said, 'Please do all you can to help the homeless.' His plea was as sincere as it was moving. It came from a deeply personal place. That is because Steve knew what it meant to face homelessness.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Steve and his twin brother were born with cerebral palsy. Tragically, he lost his mother and his brother to suicide. He endured a deep depression, surviving his own suicide attempt. But, with the help of a support worker and carers, he now has his own apartment, is studying and is a vendor for <span style="font-style:italic;">The</span><span style="font-style:italic;">Big Issue</span>, which he loves. Some days Steve sells <span style="font-style:italic;">The Big Issue</span> for more than eight hours straight, and some days he does not even make a sale. His work ethic and his attitude should be an example to us all.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I did not ask him. but I am sure Steve does not care whether our Prime Minister called the Leader of the Opposition a sycophant last week. And he probably would be gobsmacked to hear a senator essentially claim, 'Won't someone think of the politicians?' when it comes to losing gold card entitlements. And Steve probably could not fathom how the CEO of Australia Post, just one man, could pocket more than $5 million a year.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Steve's plea to me about helping the homeless echoed in my mind as we stood together in the mall. He had been so open with me. And do you know what? That made me feel guilty, because there was something I did not want to tell him—something, quite frankly, I did not have the heart to tell him. That was that, according to a news report that day, the National Affordable Housing Agreement—the agreement that is meant to increase social housing, reduce homelessness and help alleviate rental stress—is rumoured to be being scrapped by the federal government in the upcoming May budget.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">In South Australia, more than 70 non-government organisations in metropolitan and country areas receive a share of this funding. All up, more than a billion dollars is injected into homelessness services and affordable housing by the federal government each year through this agreement and the National Partnership Agreement on Homelessness. Should these devastating cuts go ahead, crisis accommodation services, outreach programs and domestic violence support services will be in jeopardy. National Shelter has described the move as 'absolutely crippling' for homelessness services, predicting that the cuts would result in 'unmitigated disaster'. Reasons cited for cutting homelessness funding include that it has not achieved certain targets, such as improving affordable housing stocks and reducing homelessness. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Now, I will be the first to say that there is a lack of transparency in the spending of these funds. After questioning the Department of Social Services during Senate estimates in October last year, their answers made it abundantly clear that this lack of transparency must be addressed. Being a COAG agreement, these funds are handed to the states and territories with little oversight of how they are spent.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">In fact, the department and minister admitted to me that they have known for years that there needs to be a review of the National Affordable Housing Agreement, also known as the NAHA. But, in reviewing whether these priorities of the NAHA are being addressed, the baby must not be thrown out with the bathwater. The mother and her children fleeing a violent household would not say the support services that put a roof over their heads that are funded by the NAHA have not met their target—nor would the young person suffering mental health issues who found themselves in crisis accommodation after being kicked out of their rental, not having been able to hold down a job and afford to pay rent.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The government needs to commit to the NAHA funding. A review should aim to improve service delivery and outcomes, particularly in priority areas such as domestic violence, and not justify the removal of billions of dollars because targets allegedly are not being met.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Looking back on my afternoon with Steve, something that will stay with me is the way we practically disappeared when we put on our bright yellow vests. This was quite confronting. When I spoke to one of the other <span style="font-style:italic;">Big Issue</span> representatives that day, they said this kind of thing happens all the time. In fact, the representative told me that when the CEO of a major company in Adelaide stood in the foyer of his own building selling <span style="font-style:italic;">The Big Issue</span> and wearing the bright yellow vest, many of his employees did not recognise him. They walked past, only stopping when their boss called them out. Well-known sports personalities had similar experiences.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">For some vendors of <span style="font-style:italic;">The Big Issue</span>, this kind of invisibility is a daily occurrence. When I stood with Steve, passers-by avoided eye contact. Others pulled out their phones to look busy. Some just looked the other way. It seemed the prospect of interacting with someone who was potentially homeless was unsettling to the mallgoers that day.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">But as MPs and senators we cannot look the other way when it comes to addressing homelessness, and what the public should really find unsettling is the prospect of the government ripping funding away from essential homelessness services on the basis that it does not know whether they are achieving value for money. Improved transparency, clearer targets and better communication between the Commonwealth and state and territory governments will determine whether this much-needed funding is achieving its stated aims; simply tearing up these funding arrangements will not. We must do all we can to help the homeless and those at risk of finding themselves without a safe and secure place to sleep. As elected members we must listen to our constituents. I listened to Steve and, on his behalf, I hope the government hears his plea. And to anyone else listening tonight, if all you can do is buy a copy of this month's <span style="font-style:italic;">The Big Issue</span> and help improve on the sales that Steve and I didn't make, then please do.</span>
