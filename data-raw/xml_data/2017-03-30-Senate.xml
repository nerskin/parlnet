                  </a>  I seek an explanation from the Attorney-General on the following matters. The Attorney-General has specifically refused to allow answers as to whether his office prepared a direction under the Judiciary Act, which would have prevented the Australian tax office from intervening in the Bell matter. Will the Attorney-General give us that answer now? Secondly, does the Attorney-General believe that he is above the rules of the Senate which specify legal privilege is not on its own a basis for refusing to answer questions in a Senate committee? Why has the Attorney-General not complied with the Senate's request to provide a legitimate basis for a public interest immunity claim? I note that in his response to the Senate tabled on 23 March, the Attorney-General stated:</span>
              </p>

                <span class="HPS-Small">Thus, whether or not the Senate has accepted that matters pertaining to confidential legal advice to government are always and in all circumstances immune from disclosure is neither here nor there. The fact is that, in general, such matters are not disclosed.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">Can the Attorney-General explain to the Senate why he believes that what the Senate accepts or asks for is 'neither here nor there'? The report tabled yesterday by the Legal and Constitutional Affairs References Committee required that the Attorney-General provide to the committee a statement of the grounds for concluding that it would not be in the public interest to disclose the information specifying the harm to the public interest that would result from the disclosure of the information of the documents. Will the Attorney-General comply with the committee's requirement? </span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">On what basis does the Attorney-General believe that there would be a harm to the administration of justice, given that the litigation has now ended and there is no risk of compromising that litigation? The Attorney-General would be aware of evidence given before the committee on Monday, 27 March, that the Australian tax office was so worried that the Attorney-General was about to issue a direction that they sought legal advice and made the tax commissioner, Chris Jordan, aware of those plans. Why didn't the Attorney-General's office disabuse them of this notion if he had no such plans? Why did the Attorney-General say to Andrew Mills on 7 March that he was not going to issue a direction unprompted? That would suggest the Attorney-General was actually considering doing so. Will the Attorney-General now tell the truth? Was he planning to issue a direction to stop the tax office from intervening?</span>

                  </a>  I made a note of what Senator Pratt has asked. In answer to question No. 1: that matter has been dealt with on several occasions. I might remind the Senate that this issue has been the subject of questions at estimates, at a spillover estimates day and at the Senate references committee. On each occasion, the response has been that this question goes to legal advice and, therefore, consistent with the uniform practice of all Australian governments, it will not be provided for that reason on the ground of public interest immunity.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">On question No. 2: no, Senator Pratt. I believe that I am obliged to comply with the same constitutional convention that every Australian Attorney-General and, indeed, minister has complied with in relation to protecting legal advice provided to the Commonwealth. </span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">In relation to question No. 3, contrary to what is asserted in the question, a public interest immunity claim was fully articulated in response to the questions, and I table a copy of the public interest immunity claim as articulated. The requirement of <span style="font-style:italic;">Odgers'</span>, which is one point of view about this, and not the only point of view, is that a public interest immunity claim be fully articulated. It has been, and the document I have tabled you have seen before because it is in the form of the answers provided in articulating the public interest immunity claim.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">In response to your fourth question, Senator Pratt, it is not a question of whether orders of the Senate were neither here nor there. The question is what my obligations are, as a minister and as an Attorney, to protect the position of the Commonwealth in relation to its legal advice, and that is explained and set out in the answers that were given, which are embodied in the document I have just tabled.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">In answer to your fifth question, the requirement to provide a statement was complied with, so the assertion in your question is incorrect. But, nevertheless, out of courtesy to the Senate I have tabled, once again, the grounds of the public interest immunity claim—a claim, by the way, taken on advice.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The answer to your sixth question is explained in the document that has just been tabled and was explained in the written answer provided to the question when it was taken on notice. All other matters which you raise have been dealt with by me already in evidence before either the references committee or the estimates committee or in the instrument which I have tabled.</span>

                  </a>  Firstly, Attorney, are you aware that the ATO sought legal advice on their position should you issue a direction that they not intervene in the Bell matter in the High Court? When did you become aware of this? What, if anything, did you or any of your staff do after you became aware of that? Secondly, do you agree that the precedent of this Senate is that the fact that legal advice might be considered privileged by government or by a minister does not automatically mean that it satisfies the public interest immunity requirements that have been established in the past by this chamber? Thirdly, are you seriously walking away from <span style="font-style:italic;">Odgers'</span> in here today? Do you regard it as a fire starter to get your kindling going, or do you accord it anything higher than simply being one opinion on how this Senate works? If you do, what other body of work do you rely on to give advice to the senators in this place and to the chamber as a whole about how the Senate operates?</span>

Obviously, I will have to take that on notice. In relation to the position of invoking a public interest immunity claim in respect of legal advice, that, as I pointed out in my answer to Senator Pratt, is the invariable position of all Australian governments, and it has been since Federation, and in the written answers to questions that I took on notice in the references committee, which I have tabled again this morning, the various precedents quoting the views of attorneys-general from both sides of politics are set out. They are merely a sample of those views. It is an absolutely fundamental position that the Commonwealth does not publicly disclose its legal advice and that that is a recognised ground of public interest immunity.</span>

The view it takes of certain matters concerning the relationship between the Senate and the executive government, of which this is one, is not, and has often not been, shared by the executive government. To the extent to which <span style="font-style:italic;">Odgers'</span> asserts that the executive government has certain obligations in the Senate in relation to the disclosure of legal advice, that is inconsistent with the unvaried practice of all Australian governments since Federation.</span>

                  </a>  My first question relates to evidence that we have taken at this inquiry already, which is that the Attorney-General did not personally prepare a direction to stop the ATO from intervening in this case, but we know that the Attorney-General has refused to answer whether his office prepared a direction to prevent the ATO intervening. My first question is: doesn't this cause an inference that his office did request such a direction to be prepared? My second question asks the Attorney-General for his response to the evidence from senior Australian tax office officials this week that the prospect of a direction being issued against them by the Attorney-General or his office was discussed between the Australian tax office, Treasury and the Australian Government Solicitor. My third question to the Attorney-General is for him to advise when the last time was that a Commonwealth minister had to be hauled before the full Senate to stop avoiding answering questions.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">According to the advice received by the Legal and Constitutional Affairs References Committee, the existence of legal professional privilege may lend weight to a public interest immunity claim, but any such claim must nonetheless be raised on an accepted ground and accompanied by a statement of the harm to be apprehended from the disclosure of the information sought, and that is that the harm specified should relate to the matter at hand. What is the harm to the public interest in relation to this matter specifically, not in relation to general disclosure of legal advice? What is the harm to the public interest in relation to the Bell matter that would occur from the disclosure of the information sought?</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">As I outlined in my questions, in his response to the Senate, tabled on 23 March, the Attorney-General showed absolute disregard for the standing orders of this place when he stated: 'Thus, whether or not the Senate has accepted that matters pertaining to confidential legal advice to government are always and in all circumstances immune from disclosure is neither here nor there.' That is blatant disregard for the standing orders of this place. He went on to say: 'The fact is that, in general, such matters are not disclosed.' That is not a proper reflection of his obligation to the Senate. It is important that the Attorney-General is able to explain his actions and he has failed to do so adequately today. It really demonstrates that he believes he is above the rules of the Senate which specify that legal privilege is not in and of itself a basis for refusing answers to Senate committees or, indeed, for refusing answers in this place.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">So the question before us today is why the Attorney-General has not complied with the Senate's request to provide the basis for his public interest immunity claims. It needs to be a legitimate basis. The substantive nature of the public interest immunity claim made by Senator Brandis does not meet the threshold tests required by this chamber. The report tabled by the committee yesterday required the Attorney-General to provide the committee with a statement of the grounds for concluding that it would not be in the public interest to disclose this information, specifying the harm to the public interest. There has been no recognition within the Attorney-General's answers that goes to that point. No harm to the public interest has been specified that would demonstrate that there is a harm to the administration of justice, given that the litigation in this matter has now ended and there is no risk of compromising that litigation.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">On that note, why the Attorney-General has specifically refused to allow answers as to whether his office prepared a direction, under the Judiciary Act, that would have prevented the Australian tax office from intervening in this matter has not been answered. The Attorney-General, again, was aware of evidence given before the Senate committee on 27 March that the tax office was so worried that the Attorney-General was about to issue such a direction that they indeed sought legal advice and made the tax commissioner, Chris Jordan, aware of those plans. It is very clear that the Attorney-General did not make any efforts to disabuse them of that notion, because it is clear that he had such plans, and he has made no explanation to the Senate regarding those plans. On that basis, why did the Attorney-General say to Andrew Mills on 7 March that he was not going to issue a direction unprompted? Indeed, that suggests that the Attorney-General was considering doing so. Why won't the Attorney-General tell the truth on that matter? He was indeed planning to issue a direction to stop the Australian tax office from intervening.</span>

                  <a href="JKM" type="MemberSpeech">
                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Senator McKIM</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Tasmania</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">10:01</span>):  Right through this sorry saga the Attorney-General's behaviour has been rife with evasion, with obfuscation, with delay and in fact with arrogance. He has arrogantly refused to answer questions, he has arrogantly failed to respond to questions on notice within the time frame set by the Legal and Constitutional Affairs References Committee, and that arrogance has been topped off today by the Attorney-General telling the Senate that he knows better than that massive body of work, put together by a rank of experts in Senate practice, contained in <span style="font-style:italic;">Odgers'</span>. I want to be clear about this: I have seen strongmen rip up phone books in my time, but to see an Attorney-General come in here and basically rip up <span style="font-style:italic;">Odgers</span><span style="font-style:italic;">'</span> this morning is something I never thought I would see.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I want to say to the Attorney that my experience in parliaments is that when a stoush emerges or differences emerge between parliaments and executive governments, parliaments tend to win. When you think about it, that is logical, because it is executive government that flows from parliament, not the other way around. The pre-eminent institution in our democracy is this parliament. It is not the cabinet, it is not the office of the Prime Minister and it is certainly not the office of the Attorney-General. We are debating right now in the pre-eminent institution of our democracy, the Commonwealth Parliament of Australia, and what we say goes, not what the Attorney-General, Senator Brandis, says.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I want to address now the issue of legal privilege. The first point to make is the obvious point that the Attorney-General has continually missed in this debate—that is, that legal privilege is his to waive. Governments right through Australia's history have from time to time chosen to waive legal privilege and provide matters that otherwise would have been covered by legal privilege, because it was in their political interests to do so. I have seen it on many occasions, both in the Tasmanian parliament and, before I was a senator in this place, through the media in relation to governments at a national level in this country. Make no mistake: the Attorney-General could right now waive legal privilege and provide the information that the Senate is asking for. The fact that he is not doing that shows that he has something to hide here. It is not good enough to him to rely on what he describes as a 'lengthy precedent of governments of all stripes in this country'. The Attorney could waive legal privilege, if he wanted to, and he could provide that advice to the Senate right now. It is his gift to give, but he is not giving the gift, presumably because he has something to hide. This is why we need to see the advice that this motion or the motion previously passed by the Senate refers to.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The second point to make—and this the question I put to the Attorney that he did not go to in his answer—is that clearly the precedent of this Senate is not to accept a simple claim of legal privilege as grounds for a successful claim of public interest immunity. That is the long precedent of this place. We need from the Attorney a proper claim of public interest immunity that outlines in detail the public harm that he claims would flow from releasing the legal advice. That is certainly what the Australian Greens expect from the Attorney-General.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The third point to make, and I go to the specific matter of the Attorney's awareness of the ATO's decision to seek legal advice on what their position would be, is should the Attorney issue a direction that the ATO not intervene in the Bell Group matter in the High Court. He has taken that on notice, and I hope that he does a better job of meeting the requirements of matters on notice than has been his unfortunate track record in the past, where we have seen many dozens of failures from this Attorney to respond within the appropriate time frames to questions put on notice.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">It is important that we all understand that the ATO heard what they described as bureaucratic whispers that the Attorney was considering issuing a direction that the ATO not intervene in the Bell Group matter in the High Court. So clearly this was the discussion at senior levels of the Commonwealth bureaucracy—and so it should have been, because it would have been almost unprecedented had the Attorney decided to issue a direction to effectively prevent the ATO from maximising its opportunities to recover the moneys it believed were owed to Commonwealth coffers as a result of the matters in Western Australia, with the winding up of the Bell group of companies.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We need to know what the Attorney knew and when—and when I say 'the Attorney' I include all of his  staff. I have been a minister in the Tasmanian government, and we all know what your staff do is in effect what you do. When a staff member tells someone something, it is as if the minister told them himself or herself. So we need to know what the Attorney and his staff knew about the ATO seeking legal advice on their position should the Attorney have directed them not to intervene, when he became aware of it, and what happened either in his office or from his office out into any part of the bureaucracy in this country, including the Solicitor-General's office, once he became aware of that fact.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Queensland</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">10:09</span>):  What a humiliating morning for the Attorney-General of Australia. This man is so determined to hide evidence from the Senate and Senate inquiries that he has to be hauled before the full Senate and be asked questions that he will not answer when put to him by a committee set up to inquire into this issue. I cannot remember the last time I saw a minister, whether in a state parliament or the federal parliament, having to be dragged before the full chamber in order to get them to stop hiding information that is reasonably sought by a committee. You can only wonder what Senator Brandis's colleagues must think of the amount of time that is being expended in defending his incompetence, his secrecy and his deception. This is a government that is struggling desperately to get clear air to do something positive for this country. We are told that we are going to sit into the night tonight to try to get legislation through which they say is necessary for the future of this country, but yet again Senator Brandis's incompetence and deception is causing the Senate to divert time to ask him very reasonable questions about his practice and that of his office.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">This is yet another example of the lengths of deception that this Attorney-General is prepared to go to to prevent the truth getting out about his involvement in very serious matters under his portfolio. It was not that long ago that we had to establish a Senate inquiry into his behaviour in relation to the former Solicitor-General of Australia and we had very clear evidence from numerous senior officials in this government, from the Solicitor-General down, that the Attorney-General had clearly taken action against the Solicitor-General as retribution for the Solicitor-General's desire to maintain some level of independence around the advice that he had given. We have seen the Attorney-General deceive the Senate previously about his role with the Solicitor-General—</span>

The Attorney-General is supposed to be someone who is beyond reproach in their administration of justice of justice but, instead, in Senator Brandis we have someone who will go to extraordinary lengths to prevent the Senate from getting the truth and from getting basic information about how he has conducted himself in this role.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">To briefly recap what we have ascertained so far over the course of this inquiry, this really involves the apparent deal between the federal government and the Western Australian government to turn a blind eye to over $300 billion in taxes that were owed by the Bell group of companies to the Australian taxpayer. It does seem clear that the former Treasurer, Joe Hockey, did reach some sort of a deal with the Western Australian government to forgive the payment of those taxes, but Senator Brandis's involvement in this matter more concerned the attempts that were made to pressure the Australian Taxation Office to not pursue those taxes in our courts. We will all remember the statement from the Attorney-General in late November last year when he told the Senate that his first personal involvement in this case was on 3 March 2016, and of course before too long he had one of his own Liberal counterparts, the former Western Australian Attorney-General, come out publicly and say that that was not correct and that he had actually spoken to Senator Brandis in early February. Senator Brandis had one of his now infamous memory losses. He does not recall that conversation and maintains this ridiculous fiction that having a conversation with an Attorney-General from Western Australia does not amount to personal involvement in the matter.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">What the inquiry has turned to more recently is the apparent efforts by Senator Brandis, or his office on his behalf, to nobble the Australian tax office and to prevent them from taking legal action to try to recover over $300 million in unpaid taxes owed to the Commonwealth taxpayer. Most Australian taxpayers would want to make sure that companies who owe taxes repay those taxes and do the right thing, and they would expect the Australian tax office to pursue those taxes on their behalf. But what we have uncovered over the course of this inquiry is an apparent attempt by the Attorney-General or his office to prevent the Australian tax office from doing its job. Even today, those who have been listening to Senator Brandis will have noted his slippery use of language to yet again try to evade responsibility in this matter. What he has told the Senate again today is that no direction was issued to the Australian tax office to prevent them from taking action. That is not the subject of the questions that have been asked. What has been asked is: what directions were drafted by his office, or what action did his office take to try to prepare a direction, to stop the Australian tax office from taking action?</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">In an earlier hearing in this inquiry, we asked whether the Attorney-General himself directed the tax office, or prepared a direction to the tax office, to stop them from interfering in this case. We were told very clearly by the Attorney-General's Department that the Attorney-General had not done so. But, when we went on to ask whether the Attorney-General's office had prepared a direction to stop the ATO from doing its job, or had asked the Attorney-General's Department to prepare such a direction, we were not told the answer to that one. Privilege was claimed. A public interest immunity was claimed. And we are now told by the Attorney-General that it is against the public interest to reveal whether his office directed the ATO or attempted to direct the ATO from interfering in this case.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">What I cannot understand is why it does not constitute legal advice and it is not privileged information to tell the Senate that the Attorney-General did not direct the ATO, or did not seek to prevent the ATO, but, when we want to ask questions about what the Attorney-General's office has done, all of a sudden the walls of privilege go up. There is a clear inconsistency and a clear double standard that is being used by the Attorney-General and his department to try to hide the involvement of the Attorney-General's office in this matter.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">This week we received clear evidence from the Australian tax office. We asked them again whether they had become aware of any discussions about the prospect of a direction being issued. What they advised the Senate inquiry was that senior Australian tax office officials were aware of discussions and were party to discussions with officers from Treasury and the Australian Government Solicitor about attempts being made by the Attorney-General's office to prevent them from interfering in this case.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">Everyone accepts that ultimately no direction was issued, and I suspect that is due to the efforts of the Australian tax office in fighting back against Senator Brandis and his attempts to nobble this case. But what we now have is clear evidence on the record where senior officers of the Australian tax office have said that they were having discussions with their counterparts in Treasury and the Australian Government Solicitor about efforts that were being made to stop them from interfering in this case.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">It is about time that the Attorney-General finally came clean with the Senate. He is the first law officer of this country. He is supposed to be beyond reproach. He is supposed to be someone who is just quietly doing his job rather than distracting the government from their agenda. But, time after time after time, we have to spend the Senate's time trying to get answers out of this Attorney-General, and, in the process, he goes on to embarrass all of his colleagues and the government as a whole. The Attorney-General should just answer clearly today whether his office requested that a direction be drafted to prevent the Australian tax office from interfering in this case, and then these questions would cease.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Queensland</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">10:19</span>):  I want to indicate a view that I perhaps can hold more than anyone else, because I have been in this parliament more than anyone else. I just say that Senator Brandis is probably the best Attorney-General I have ever experienced in this chamber. Senator Brandis is a longstanding colleague of mine—not a particular friend, I might say, but a longstanding colleague. I have known him over a long period of time. His knowledge of the law is impeccable. His attention to precision and detail is without peer in this chamber and in any Attorney that I have seen here in the 27 years I have been here. I have seen a few, and there have been some good ones—none of the Labor ones, I might say, but there have been some very good attorneys-general from the coalition. Senator Brandis is as good as, if not better than, all of them.</span>

They are not Senate inquiries; they are simply Labor Party and Greens inquiries. I keep wondering why they do it. It is pretty obvious that if you want to attack someone, if you want to bring someone down, you do not do that to the worst-performing minister in the parliament; you do it to the best, the one that causes you most trouble, the one that has an accurate answer to every allegation levelled against the government in his role both as Leader of the Government in the Senate and as Attorney-General.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">When you keep trying and can never ever get a kink in the armour, it sets the Labor Party and the Greens up further. They keep holding these Labor Party and Greens inquiries—not, I emphasise, Senate inquiries, because more often than not these inquiries set up by the Labor Party and the Greens are held at times when they know government senators will not be available. So they are not Senate reports—they are not Senate inquiries—they are simply reports and inquiries of the Labor Party and the Greens, who keep—</span>

I heard someone mentioned inquiry into the Solicitor-General. We all know the result of that. Senator Brandis came out unscathed and unblemished, with not a chink taken out of anything he had said in that whole debate. But the Solicitor-General, I have to say, did the right thing and resided during the course of the hearing, because the Solicitor-General knew that his conduct as an officer of the government—dealing with secret information to a member of the opposition—was untenable. I did not know the Solicitor-General—I do not think I ever had anything to do with him—but I thought his conduct was particularly improper and that he did the right thing by resigning. I only raise that to say that the Labor Party and the Greens keep running these political inquiries because they want to attack the person who is most valuable to the government and is the one who causes most grief to the Labor Party and the Greens.</span>

Can you believe it? Can you believe the Senate is spending any time on rehashing one of the darkest periods in Labor Party history, and there have been plenty of dark ones with the Labor Party, I tell you. The darkest period in Labor Party history in Western Australia and, by implication, federally was when the Labor Party got into bed with crooks who cheated Western Australians out of a lot of money. That is the genesis of this inquiry. I cannot believe that the Labor Party would want to rehash this, that it would want to remind the Australian public of the dishonesty, of the criminality, of the Labor Party in Western Australia 30 years ago. You might remember that—was it one or two?—Labor premiers went to jail over this incident.</span>

                  </a>  Brian Burke? I thought there might have been another Premier or a minister. These were Labor Party politicians who went to jail. They were crooks, yet the Labor Party and the Greens in this chamber want to remind us about that. That I cannot understand.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I do not have the detail as well as the Attorney has, but he has repeated it so often to this chamber that even I can have an understanding of some of the issues. It was all about WA Inc., where money was owing. There was a liquidation. The liquidation had gone on for 20 or 30 years. Some lawyers had been paid small fortunes—millions of dollars—in dealing with the distribution of the few assets that remain from some of the WA Inc. companies. The Western Australian government was trying to make sure that the maximum amount available could be paid to creditors 30 years later. That is what the Western Australian government was doing. At one stage, the Commonwealth became involved because the tax office was involved. The evidence clearly shows, you do not need me to repeat it and you do not need Senator Brandis to repeat it again—the evidence is there, it is in the <span style="font-style:italic;">Hansard</span> of the committee hearings that I have read—that the tax office went ahead and did what it was going to do. The suggestion that somehow the Commonwealth was going to miss out on money is just so ludicrous. I cannot understand the Labor Party except if you come back to my original premise that it is this constant attack on Senator Brandis, who, as I say, is one of the best attorneys-general I have seen in this parliament in the 27 years I have been here. He is a man with impeccable legal knowledge, a man whose precision and detail are beyond reproach. And you have these amateurs from the Labor Party and the Greens thinking they will make their mark in life by trying to find a chink in his armour—people who failed in state parliaments, failed in Tasmania, failed in Queensland. They could never make their way there, and they hope that they can do something in this chamber by raising these issues.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I appreciate there are a lot more important things to be discussing today, and the Senate really should get on and do them. We have had this farce this morning of the Senate taking a lot of time—and I apologise to the Senate clerks. Obviously the Labor Party has imposed on the Senate clerks to write out all these questions to ask and these motions to put. It was wasting the time of the Senate clerks, of the Senate committees area, to put up this series of questions, which I listened to earlier. Senator Brandis has answered every single one of them—I might say for about the third or fourth time.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The issue has come up about the parliamentary privilege of legal advice. That is an uncontestable proposition. As the Attorney has said, as anyone who has been around parliament for a long while knows, you cannot run a government if the legal advice is made public. That is something that governments since 1901 have been adopting. It is something that governments around the world do. It is uncontroversial. It is not contestable. And yet we have spent so much time here today arguing about this.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">As I say, there are more important things to be dealt with. I just felt compelled to enter the debate when I heard the previous speakers carrying on about things they clearly know nothing about. They are desperate to try and find a chink in the armour. They are desperate to try and bring down one of the government's better performers. All of this continues on. This is the third, fourth or fifth inquiry now and, as I say, Senator Brandis has come out of each one of them not only looking and smelling like roses but actually being a rose. Why the Labor Party and the Greens continue to waste the Senate's time on this I simply cannot understand. I should be encouraging them to continue, because they keep making fools of themselves. They keep looking like spoilt little children who cannot become king of the kids. They take on all of these quite ridiculous inquiries at the taxpayers' expense. </span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I repeat, in case it has escaped anyone's attention: these so-called inquiries are not Senate inquiries. They are inquiries set up by the majority Greens and Labor. They are manned by the majority Greens and Labor. Most of the hearings are held when the majority know that government members cannot be available because we are involved in other—</span>

                  </a>  How can it be a Senate inquiry when it is Labor and Greens? They are set down when Labor Party and Greens members know that government senators are elsewhere, on other inquiries. They have been told time and time again that government senators have other committees that they are precommitted to, and the hearings are still set down. So you have three Labor senators and a Greens senator as voting members on these committees, and no government senator. How can they possibly be classed as Senate inquiries, when they are nothing more than a political game being carried on by the Labor Party and the Greens political party, using Senate resources and the taxpayers' money? It is a disgrace.</span>

I thank him for what he has done for Australia as the Leader of the Government in the Senate and as one of the best Attorney-Generals I have seen in my long term here. I again wish Senator Brandis continuing success—as I know he will have—in his role leading the government in this chamber and as Attorney-General of our nation.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Victoria</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">10:35</span>):  It is very interesting to see Senator Macdonald there saying that all this debate this morning is a total waste of time and then spend 16 minutes going on about it. I can tell Senator Macdonald, through the chair, that I am not part of a Labor-led witch-hunt against the Attorney-General and I have no desire to ever be a lawyer—I never have had, even though I have spent a lot of time in courts.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Some senators and, more importantly, the Australian public may wonder why there have been so many hearings by the Legal and Constitutional Affairs References Committee into all of this, because, as you well point out, Senator, this is about Bond and Bell and it happened 25 to 30 years ago. But there are two points I want to make here. We had Joe Hockey, the then Treasurer, making a deal with the Western Australian government to divert $300 million—which should have gone to the Australian taxpayer through the ATO, through the Commonwealth—back to the Western Australian government, which would deprive other small creditors. WA would get the $300 million and other creditors would not. Especially, the ATO, the Commonwealth, would not get it. They dudded the small creditors out in WA. They dudded the Commonwealth. That is one point.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The second point—and why it is important—is that I believe that this is what led to the directive by the Attorney-General, as a spin-off last year, to make himself the gatekeeper of all legal issues, so all ministers, all departments, had to go through him. On that occasion we had the then Solicitor-General, Mr Gleeson, eventually resigning. I mentioned earlier that forceful argument that they had about Mr Gleeson, the then Solicitor-General, being before the High Court as the ATO's lawyer at the time. I will not be taking up the 20 minutes on this. I made my point earlier. I make it again. I just want to stress to Senator Macdonald, through the chair, that I am not part of some Labor-Greens cabal in all of this. I am a participating member of the committee, and I do not regret a minute of it.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">I have never seen such a farce made of Senate procedure in the 17 years I have been here as I have seen this morning. After lengthy questioning at Senate estimates on both the principal hearing day and the spillover day, after two hearings of a references committee where the Labor Party and the Greens got absolutely nowhere, they seek now to try and revive this flogged, dead horse of an issue on the last morning of sittings. I am going to use my time to address a couple of the issues of fact in relation to the Bell litigation, and, secondly—</span>

                  </a>  if you would have the courtesy to hear me in silence, please, Senator O'Neill—elaborate upon the grounds of public interest immunity which I felt compelled to take in discharge of my duties to the Commonwealth, on advice.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Let us talk about the Bell litigation. Mr Acting Deputy President Whish-Wilson, indulge me, if you will, for a moment. The Prime Minister described the Bell litigation as the Jarndyce and Jarndyce of Australian law. Jarndyce and Jarndyce, for those unfamiliar with it, is the fictional suit which was the subject of Charles Dickens's novel <span style="font-style:italic;">Bleak House</span>. This is how Charles Dickens described Jarndyce and Jarndyce:</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Small">Jarndyce and Jarndyce drones on. This scarecrow of a suit has, in course of time, become so complicated that no man alive knows what it means. The parties to it understand it least, but it has been observed that no two Chancery lawyers can talk about it for five minutes without coming to a total disagreement as to all the premises. Innumerable children have been born into the cause; innumerable young people have married into it; innumerable old people have died out of it. Scores of persons have deliriously found themselves made parties in Jarndyce and Jarndyce without knowing how or why; whole families have inherited legendary hatreds with the suit. The little plaintiff or defendant who was promised a new rocking-horse when Jarndyce and Jarndyce should be settled has grown up, possessed himself of a real horse, and trotted away into the other world. Fair wards of court have faded into mothers and grandmothers; a long procession of Chancellors has come in and gone out; the legion of bills in the suit have been transformed into mere bills of mortality; there are not three Jarndyces left upon the earth perhaps since old Tom Jarndyce in despair blew his brains out at a coffee-house in Chancery Lane; but Jarndyce and Jarndyce still drags its dreary length before the court, perennially hopeless.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">That is an apt description of the Bell litigation. There are very few of the directors still alive who were parties to the commercial transactions in the 1970s and 1980s that led to the Bell group of companies being put into liquidation some 30 years ago. And, like the young child who was promised a rocking horse when Jarndyce and Jarndyce should be settled, there is a man who began his legal career working on the Bell litigation as an articled law clerk in Perth who now sits on the High Court, so long has the Bell litigation proceeded.</span>

                  </a>  and with the support of the Greens in the Western Australian parliament, tried to do was to bring the matter to an end by an all-up statutory settlement. That statutory settlement was the subject of the High Court proceedings of which we have heard so much. But the first thing to remember about this is that this was a nonpartisan attempt to bring to an end more than 30 years of seemingly endless litigation on which, according to some estimates, almost half a billion dollars of lawyers' fees, liquidators' fees and insolvency practitioners' fees had already been wasted. So the motive was pure.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">It is said by Senator Watt and others that Mr Hockey entered into a deal with the Western Australian government in relation to the High Court proceedings. That is false. The evidence before the references committee could not have been clearer. Senator Watt himself asked the question about an arrangement having been struck, and Mr Mills from the Australian Taxation Office said this:</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Small">I might correct the record. The letters actually do not show that there was any arrangement.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">He went on to say—Mr Mills, that is:</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Small">From all that we could read from the Treasurer's letter back to the Western Australian Treasurer … we were not compromised in any way in terms of what we believed was the action we should take.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Let me say that again. Mr Mills, the second Commissioner of Taxation, said:</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Small">… we were not compromised in any way in terms of what we believed was the action we should take.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Now, Senator Watt knew that that evidence had been given before the Senate committee because he was the senator asking the questions, and yet he represented to the Senate this morning the opposite, that there was a deal, when he knew the only evidence was that there was not a deal. People can draw their own conclusions about Senator Watt's honesty, and we can be very satisfied that Mr Hockey has nothing to answer.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Secondly, the suggestion was made by Senator Watt and others that I had in some way interfered with the Australian Taxation Office. This was the evidence before the Senate committee, first of all from Mr Chris Jordan, the Commissioner of Taxation:</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Small">No-one sought to inappropriately or otherwise persuade us to discontinue from that view. … Whether or not people were having discussions outside of us, no-one ever sought to inappropriately influence the course of action that we had, continued and did.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">That is the Commissioner of Taxation speaking on behalf of the Australian Taxation Office. Mr Mills, on 7 December, said:</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Small">The ATO have upheld our position as an independent administrator and independence in our decisions throughout the course of this matter. Neither the commissioner nor I, or any other decision-maker in the ATO, were lent on by a minister or their office or directed to do anything other than what we did.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Senator McKim asked some questions of Mr Mills on the same day about me. Senator McKim said: </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Small">Did he—</span>
              </p>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">that is, Senator Brandis—</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Small">at any stage seek to dissuade the ATO from intervening?</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">And Mr Mills said, 'No.' That is the evidence and that is the fact, but you would not think so from hearing the speeches given by Senator McKim, Senator Pratt and Senator Watt. But that is the evidence and those are the facts.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">This entire wasted morning is an argument about nothing. It is an argument about an instruction that was never given, about a direction that was never issued. The highest to which the case made by the opposition rises, on the basis of evidence from an officer earlier in the week who was not directly involved, was that he had heard some bureaucratic whispers. Honestly and truly, Senator Pratt, if that is the best you can do—and it is the best you can do—you should not waste our time.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Let me turn to the question of the circumstances in which the Australian government, through its ministers, claims protection from publication of its legal advice. Let me say again—as I said in answer to you, Senator Pratt, and others—that it is absolutely the standard position of the Australian government that its legal advice, like the legal advice of any private client, for that matter, is not made public. Senators have been misled, perhaps through ignorance rather than malice, by a selective quotation from <span style="font-style:italic;">Odgers</span><span style="font-style:italic;">'</span>, which, in the current addition of <span style="font-style:italic;">Odgers'</span>, the 14th edition, between pages 668 and 669, under the item 'Legal professional privilege', says this:</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Small">Legal advice to the federal government, however, is often disclosed by the government itself.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">And it is the case that on occasions privilege is waived, but that is not the standard case, as you know, Senator. It continues:</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Small">Therefore, the mere fact that information is legal advice to the government does not establish a basis for this ground. It must be established that there is some particular harm to be apprehended by the disclosure of the information, such as prejudice to pending legal proceedings or to the Commonwealth's position in those proceedings.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The problem with the selective quotation of that passage from <span style="font-style:italic;">Odgers' </span>is that it disregards the long discussion that goes before in relation to the various grounds of public interest immunity.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Senator McKim, you said in your contribution: 'The Senate does not accept a simple claim of public interest immunity; a detailed statement is required.' I accept that, Senator Watt, and I provided a detailed statement, which is the document I tabled this morning and which I will read into the record. What it represents is both a statement of the universal practice of all Australian governments since Federation in relation to legal advice, subject in exceptional circumstances to waiver, I acknowledge, but that is something that is seldom done and is never done, nor should be done, if the advice to government is that the publication of the advice would prejudice the legal position of the Commonwealth.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">So here are the detailed grounds, not of a legal professional privilege claim but for a public interest immunity claim. The selective quotation, as I say, from <span style="font-style:italic;">Odgers' </span>of the passage that deals with legal professional privilege ignores, perhaps through ignorance or perhaps deliberately, the broader ground of public interest immunity, which <span style="font-style:italic;">Odgers' </span>also addresses and which is the ground of the claim made in detail on behalf of the Commonwealth by me. Let me read it into the record. We begin with the statement of the former Labor Attorney-General Senator the Hon. Gareth Evans QC:</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Small">Nor is it the practice or has it been the practice over the years for any government to make available legal advice from its legal advisers made in the course of the normal decision making process of government, for good practical reasons associated with good government and also as a matter of fundamental principle.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">That was what Senator Gareth Evans, the only Labor QC who has sat in the Senate as Attorney-General, said. To similar effect were the remarks of another former Attorney-General, the Hon Daryl Williams QC:</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Small">… I am going to offer the traditional response. I am not going to speculate about advice that the government may or may not have received nor am I going to provide any of that advice.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Another former Labor senator and shadow Attorney-General, who is also a member of the bar, Senator Joe Ludwig, of recent memory, put the position as follows:</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Small">To the extent that we are now going to go to the content of the advice, can I say that it has been a longstanding practice of both this government and successive governments not to disclose the content of advice.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The Hon. Philip Ruddock, another former Attorney-General, stated:</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Small">It is not the practice of the Attorney to comment on matters of legal advice to the government. Any advice given, if it is given, is given to the government.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Those are clear and uncontroversial statements from both sides of politics which indicate what, as I have said, is an invariable practice which stretches back to Federation, and I as the Attorney-General would be in outrageous breach of my obligations to the Commonwealth to depart from what has been the invariable practice of the Commonwealth executive government since Federation.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I continue:</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Small">Thus, whether or not the Senate has accepted that matters pertaining to confidential legal advice to government are always and in all circumstances immune from disclosure is neither here nor there. The fact is that, in general, such matters are not disclosed. Plainly, as I acknowledged at the hearing, there may be exceptional circumstances in which to depart from that general practice. However, no such exception arises in the present context. On the contrary: as I will explain below, the present case is one in which the potential harm of disclosure is particularly acute, and the grounds for non-disclosure thus particularly strong.</span>

                  </mc:AlternateContent>It is not in the public interest to depart from the established position that has been maintained over many years by successive governments, from both sides of politics, not to disclose privileged legal advice. Absent exceptional circumstances, it is essential that privileged legal advice provided to the Commonwealth remain confidential. Access by Government to such confidential advice is, in practical terms, critical to the development of sound Commonwealth policy and robust law-making. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Small">The High Court of Australia has repeatedly affirmed that there is a public interest in maintaining the confidentiality of legal advice. In <span style="font-style:italic;">Grant v Downs, </span>Stephen, Mason and Murphy JJ stated: </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;        margin-left:&#xD;&#xA;      28.35pt;&#xD;&#xA;        &#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Small">The rationale of this head of privilege, according to traditional doctrine, is that it promotes the public interest because it assists and enhances the administration of justice by facilitating the representation of clients by legal advisers.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Small">It has further been recognised that the doctrine of legal professional privilege itself arises from a weighing of the public interest for and against disclosure. In Waterford v Commonwealth, Mason and Wilson JJ opined:</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;        margin-left:&#xD;&#xA;      28.35pt;&#xD;&#xA;        &#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Small">Legal professional privilege is itself the product of a balancing exercise between competing public interests whereby, subject to the well-recognised crime or fraud exception, the public interest in "the perfect administration of justice" is accorded paramountcy over the public interest that requires, in the interests of a fair trial, the admission in evidence of all relevant documentary evidence. Given its application, no further balancing exercise is required.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Small">That view was reaffirmed by Gleeson CJ, Gaudron and Gummow JJ in <span style="font-style:italic;">Esso Australia Resources Limited v Commissioner of Taxation.</span> Their honours succinctly stated the rationale for the privilege: it "exists to serve the public interest in the administration of justice by encouraging full and frank disclosure by clients to their lawyers."</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Small">It follows from these observations that the specific harm that the doctrine seeks to prevent is the harm to the administration of justice that would result from the disclosure of confidential interactions between lawyer and client.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Small">It also follows that to invoke the doctrine of legal professional privilege is to identify the specific harm to the administration of justice that the doctrine seeks to prevent.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Small">Here, the Committee's questions go to the heart of the Commonwealth's approach to constitutional litigation in the High Court. Disclosure of advice in this context would mean that in some of the most sensitive litigation faced by the Commonwealth—constitutional litigation with a State—the Commonwealth could no longer be assured that its dealings with its lawyers would remain confidential.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I table a copy of my statement. I do not think any senator would be so bold as to dispute that that is other than a detailed statement of the grounds of the harm the Commonwealth points to and of the legal and principled bases of the doctrine. So please, Senator Pratt and others, do not by taking out of context a sentence in <span style="font-style:italic;">Odgers'</span><span style="font-style:italic;"></span>about legal professional privilege try and obfuscate the fact that the basis of the claim to prevent harm to the Commonwealth is based on the broader ground of public interest immunity, also discussed by <span style="font-style:italic;">Odgers'</span>, which you conveniently neglected even so much as to mention.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">There is nothing to be found in relation to this matter. The claim for public interest immunity based upon the character of legal advice taken by government is utterly orthodox. When all of <span style="font-style:italic;">Odgers' </span>is read, it is not inconsistent with <span style="font-style:italic;">Odgers'</span> discussion of the public interest immunity ground, and I would be derelict in my duty as the Attorney to protect the legal interests of the Commonwealth to do other than as I have done.</span>

                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">

                      <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Senator POLLEY</span>
                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Tasmania</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">11:00</span>):  I rise to continue my contribution on the Fair Work Amendment (Protecting Take-Home Pay) Bill 2017. This debate verifies and confirms how out of touch this government really is. Not only is this government joining with the decision that has been made to cut penalty rates for some of the most vulnerable and lowest-paid workers in this country, but it has continued its attack on Australian workers to the extent that it is almost laughable. The government come in here and try to defend themselves and say that the Prime Minister did not go on radio to confirm his support for cutting penalty rates. First they go after penalty rates and now they are trying to hold a minimum wage increase for the lowest-paid workers in this country.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">In contrast to Labor's submission to the Fair Work Commission's annual wage review, the government's submission just lists arguments against increasing the minimum wage, including this argument, which states: 'increasing the national minimum wage is not an efficient way to address relative living standards or the needs of the low paid'. I would say to those people listening in the chamber and those reading the transcript that this shows once and for all that Malcolm Turnbull and his government do not care about Australian workers. Australian workers and their families have been neglected time and time again by this government. We know the attacks they have made on family payments.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The real issue here is that individuals rely on these penalty rates to be able to make their budgets balance at home. The money they get by having to work on Sundays and Saturdays is about ensuring that they are able to provide for their families, just like everyone else who may have better, higher-paying jobs. They have to make very tough decisions at times. Minister Cash has said in this place and also in the media that she believes this is only a minor or moderate impact on the people who will lose out when these penalty rates are cut. For the benefit of Minister Cash, government senators and others who are supporting penalty rate cuts: this money is about people being able to fill up their tank with fuel. It is about whether or not their children can get a new pair of school shoes. This is about whether or not they are able to meet their mortgage payments or their rent. These are real issues that these people have to deal with, time and time again.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">On top of everything else that this government has done in relation to cutting family payments, we see now that this arrogant and out-of-touch government is again going after the very same people—those who earn the least amount of money. They are now saying that those hardworking Australians do not need a pay rise. I can assure you that, contrary to what those on the other side have contributed to this debate thus far, there will not be any new jobs created when they cut penalty rates. That just will not happen. What will happen is that those people who rely on penalty rates will in fact have to work longer to earn the same amount of money, which means they will be away from their families for longer periods of time. It will mean there will be increased pressure on students who are trying to work their way through university. They will have to make decisions that will impact on their ability to meet their university commitments. Quite clearly, this government does not understand. They do not want to understand that the attack that they are making just increases inequality in our community, and the sector this is going to impact the most will be women.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I want to talk a little bit about the real consequences of this penalty rate cut. We know and have spoken about it in this chamber time and time again that there will be over 700,000 Australians worse off. We know that in Senator Bilyk's and my state there will be at least 40,000 Tasmanians who will be worse off. Not one of the 700,000 Australians are going to be better off. Can you imagine that you have suddenly been made aware that you are going to have this enormous cut in your take-home pay? And the real impact is that it will take 17 years for you to get back to where your current wage is today. The thing that those on the other side do not understand is that when families are impacted and have a cut like this to their take-home pay they never make up the difference. They keep falling behind. They do not have any reserves. If their washing machine breaks down, they just do not have the money to go out and buy a new washing machine. We who sit in government and in this chamber do pretty well on a monthly basis when we get our pay cheques, but these people do not. If you have never had to walk in the shoes of somebody who has to scrape their dollars together to be able to buy milk at the end of the week or to be able to pay for their children to go on a school excursion, then you have no understanding.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This is confirmation of the arrogance and of how out of touch Mr Turnbull and his liberal government are. They just do not understand what is happening out there in the community. Realistically, they have the opportunity to support this legislation. We can vote on this, and I clearly believe that they will be the last people standing. They are alone in this debate, because there is no greater conversation going on in my community. I see this when I go out and talk to people. They are everyday people who are having to confront the issues of trying to balance their weekly budgets, trying to meet their mortgage and trying to ensure their kids get a good education.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">They can vote in support of this bill and get a little bit of credibility back. Quite frankly, nobody in the community trusts this government because, no matter what they touch, it turns to stone. We have seen in here the cuts that they have tried to make in budget after budget after budget. I met with the registered nurses who work in the aged-care sector and heard first-hand about the dilemmas that they face because they really feel that their penalty rates are going to be attacked as well. It is very powerful when you have a mature woman crying when trying to explain to you what the real impact is going to be.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">It is not just Labor and the crossbenchers talking to their community about the impact that this is going to have. The strongest voices in this debate are those people who are going to be directly impacted. If those on the other side continue to campaign to attack the lowest paid workers in this country and also attack the multicultural society that we have developed in this country, with the racist changes that they want to make to section 18C, they do so at their own peril. You cannot keep cutting health and education without having an impact. You cannot change the childcare system in this country, so that some of the most disadvantaged young kids will not have the same opportunities for early childhood education, without having an impact.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I read in the newspapers Mr Turnbull's response to all these genuine issues in the community that people raise with us day in and day out. We have been taking phone calls. My office has never been so busy with constituents after the attacks on families and the Centrelink debacle where you attacked one person after another and it was totally unfounded. You cannot keep doing this without there being a reaction. If you keep attacking the most vulnerable in the community, they will rise up and ensure that you are banished. People cannot take the pressure that this government is continually putting on them. We have the highest level of underemployment in this country. You have increased the debt. Every other senator who comes in here wants to blame the previous Labor governments, but the reality is that the buck stops with you guys. You have now been in government for four years. It is time to take responsibility for your own actions. The Prime Minister promised so much before the last election but has delivered absolutely nothing.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">A government cannot walk away from their responsibility to ensure that we have a good, strong workforce and highly skilled Australians. We have lost the car industry. We have lost the skills that are so important to this country. Sooner or later you will have to go to an election, and I have no doubt at all that people will not forget this. These are not issues that people will forget overnight. When you attack people's ability to support their families, they will not forget. We will continue to stand up in this chamber and in the community day in, day out. We are never going to walk away from those in our community who depend on us to do the right thing, to protect them. We will stand with Australian workers and we will defend their right to earn penalty rates.</span>

                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Victoria</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">11:11</span>):  It is a pleasure to be speaking in this debate today on the Fair Work Amendment (Protecting Take-Home Pay) Bill 2017, but I have to say that I wondered whether we would get here at all. I wondered whether we would get to this bill at all. I wondered whether the Labor Party were in fact at all sincere about debating this issue today because they chose to spend the first hour this morning attacking the Attorney-General yet again, attempting to smear the Attorney-General's reputation yet again and engaging in another fruitless personal attack against the Attorney-General without any evidence or support for their arguments. I wondered whether we would eventually turn to an issue that they tell us is so important, that they tell us is a top priority for them and their constituents, that they tell us they hear from the community so much about and that they tell us should be the focus of the Senate's and the parliament's work. But we have got here eventually, and isn't that a wonderful thing? </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">It is also always a pleasure to follow Senator Polley in a debate. I listened careful to her contribution. She made a very sincere case for her cause in this instance. She certainly talked a lot about what the consequences could be for people if they were to be paid thanks to the Fair Work Commission's decision less penalty rates than they are currently paid. I had to say that, unfortunately, there were a fewer omissions from Senator Polley's contribution to the debate. There were a few facts that she neglected to mention, which if you did not know you might have a different view of this debate. I think it would be helpful if I took this opportunity this morning to put those facts on the record so that people can judge for themselves how this decision came about, who is responsible for this decision and what the Labor Party are walking away from with their bill here today.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I think the most important thing for people to realise is that what we have seen here this morning is just a stunt from the Labor Party. It is not sincere, it is not genuine and it is not actually an attempt to resolve a policy issue; it is an attempt to take credit for concern that they and the union movement have whipped up in the community and it is an attempt to harvest political benefit from the anxiety that they themselves are responsible for stoking in the community. A very good example of that is Senator Polley's suggestion that this decision, which applies in fact very narrowly and to a very small number of occupations, will soon in fact apply much more widely and to other professions and other occupations. She did so without any evidence, without any support for her claims. She asserted it knowing that there will be some people out there in the community who will be fearful when they hear that, who fear that they will be affected. She asserted it knowing that the union movement will back her up in her claims and that they will peddle these mistruths in an attempt to scare people and gain political benefit from doing so.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">If the Labor Party are genuinely serious about this issue, it marks a radical departure from their previous position on this issue and a radical change to industrial relations policy in this country. There are three different ways that wages could be set in this country. They could be set by the market, negotiated between employees and employers, and the best rate available would be negotiated and accepted. They could be set by the Fair Work Commission, carefully arbitrated and considered in a legal sense, with arguments for and against. Or they could be set by the parliament.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">In recent years, they have not been set by the parliament. Those opposite are suggesting that we now do so because they are unhappy and unwilling to stand by the decision of the Fair Work Commission. It reveals a lot about their attitude. It reveals their lack of support for small business and their lack of understanding of how difficult it is to run a small business, particularly on the weekend. It reveals their lack of understanding of how difficult it is for small businesses to compete with large businesses that are able to secure sweetheart deals with large unions. And it reveals in many ways an attitude which is becoming more readily apparent, which is that the union movement and the Labor Party are only able to accept decisions of the independent umpire or of the parliament if they are decisions that they agree with.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The Labor Party's rejection of the Fair Work Commission's decision in this instance mirrors very closely the rejection of the rule of law by Sally McManus, the new head of the ACTU. She has said, and she repeated it only yesterday at the National Press Club, that she thinks it is completely fine for unionists to only abide by laws which they agree with, which they approve of, which they think are fair and just. But if they do not agree with them, if they do not approve of them, if they think they are unfair, if they think they are unjust then it is absolutely up to them to completely disregard, disobey and break those laws and that is a perfectly fine thing to do. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The Labor Party has adopted the same attitude here. It will abide by the Fair Work Commission's independent decisions on wages as long as it agrees with them, as long as they are favourable. The Fair Work Commission—which Labor appointed, whose legislation Labor wrote and passed through this place enabling them to make these decisions, whose review was begun only because the now Leader of the Opposition and then Minister for Workplace Relations required them to do so—made a decision Labor did not like. They made a decision under Labor's rules, by Labor's appointees, and the Labor Party is rejecting it because it is not a decision that it liked.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">It was the then Minister for Workplace Relations, Bill Shorten, who amended the Fair Work Act in 2013 to specifically require the commission to consider penalty rates as part of the four-year review of modern awards. That was a four-year review of modern awards that was established under the Fair Work Commission when the act was passed. That was a Fair Work Commission that was established by the Labor Party. And the commissioners who made that decision were appointed by the previous Labor government. So the owners and the authors of the decision that we have seen in recent weeks are, in their entirety, the Labor Party and, in particular, Mr Shorten.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">It is not a surprise then that on Melbourne radio not that long ago, when asked whether he would abide by a decision made by a system that he set up and by people that he appointed and under rules that he wrote, Mr Shorten said yes. He was on Neil Mitchell's program on 3AW. Neil Mitchell asked:</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Small">MITCHELL: The Fair Work Commission will report soon on Sunday penalty rates. They're an independent body, in fact you had a lot to do with the way they operate now when you were Minister. Will you accept their findings given this is an independent body assessing penalty rates for Sunday, if you're Prime Minister?</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">SHORTEN: Yes.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Small">SHORTEN: Yes.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">MITCHELL: Even if they reduce Sunday penalty rates?</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">SHORTEN: Well, I said I'd accept the independent tribunal …</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">That was an interview on Neil Mitchell's program on 21 April 2016. That was not so long ago, and it is not clear what has changed in that time. There are a couple of things that could be true given that. It could be the case that Bill Shorten was not being clear and straightforward with Neil Mitchell when he was asked these questions or it could be that Bill Shorten has changed his mind since then. If he has changed his mind, it is not clear why he has done so. He knew then, as Neil Mitchell warned him, that there was a risk that the decision of the independent umpire would be to reduce Sunday penalty rates. And, knowing that, Bill Shorten said he would accept the decision. As we know, he has now not accepted that decision.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Of course, Bill Shorten does not always have a problem with accepting the reduction of penalty rates. In fact, he presided over the reduction of penalty rates as union leader at the Australian Workers Union. Workers at Clean Event were stripped of all penalty rates, with no compensation, under a 2006 agreement for which he was responsible. At the Melbourne and Olympic Park trusts, agreements were approved by Bill Shorten in 2001 and again in 2003 which stripped workers of all penalty rates and overtime except for one 125 per cent penalty rate for work performed between 1 am and 6 am. I did not hear Bill Shorten running to the parliament then saying we needed to abolish the role of the independent umpire and have wages set by law and by politicians voting on them. I did not hear him objecting to those changes. In fact, he could not have objected to those changes, because he signed off on them as a union leader.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Bill Shorten wants to make a radical change to our industrial relations policy. The private member's bill that we have before us today is a bad idea for many reasons, one of which is that it is fundamentally unworkable. The bill would require the Fair Work Commission to act inconsistently. On the one hand the commission is required to ensure awards are fair and relevant, taking into account the impact on business employment costs and employment growth, which means more jobs. On the other hand it could never reduce take-home pay, no matter how small or sensible that change might be or what might be traded off.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Bill Shorten is proposing that the Fair Work Commission not be able to make decisions that he himself made as a union leader. If this bill were passed, it would not even be possible for the Fair Work Commission to, for example, agree that Sunday penalty rates should be reduced and other rates of pay should be increased in compensation. That is something that the Fair Work Act allows a union and a business to do when they agree. They are the sorts of deals that Bill Shorten presided over many times as a union leader, and, I suspect, many of the former union leaders who are in this place and the other place would have presided over such deals, but the Fair Work Commission would be prevented from doing so by this bill.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Secondly, the bill would prevent the reduction of take-home pay for any employee covered by the award, with no consideration given to the magnitude of the reduction or why the reduction was taking place. Even a variation of an allowance in an award by a few cents—for example, in exchange for more annual leave—would be prevented by this bill. This cumbersome law would make the industrial relations system massively more rigid, reduce flexibility and reduce employees' ability to access benefits that they sought and were happy to receive.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Finally, the bill would, extraordinarily, also prevent variations from being made due to errors or inconsistencies. It would prevent variations to remove payments or allowances that are no longer relevant to the award. For example, one of the issues that the Fair Work Commission recently considered was the potential doubling up where annual leave loading and shift loadings are paid while a worker is on annual leave, based on the wording in the Electrical, Electronic and Communications Contracting Award 2010. So, if this bill were to pass, an error in an award could not be corrected by the Fair Work Commission and would be forced to persist. The bill is an extremely unworkable, inflexible proposal to change the award system.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">As I have said, the penalty rates decision was independent of government. It was made by the Fair Work Commission. It was not made by people that we appointed. It was not made under a law that we wrote. It was not made under a law that we even voted for. It was made by a law pushed through this place by those opposite. Let's get some facts on the table about what has happened with this decision. Public holiday rates are being reduced from 250 per cent to 225 per cent for permanent staff and from 275 per cent to 250 per cent for casual staff in five industries: retail, hospitality, fast food, pharmacy and restaurants. This is a decision which reflects the reality of modern shopping trends. It may be the case that, when these awards were originally designed and agreed to, Sunday shopping was not a common thing, but many consumers want to shop and many people want to work on Sundays, and this just reflects the reality of that. Workers in these industries who are covered by enterprise agreements—for example, those in a major supermarket or a fast-food chain—are not directly affected by this change. That is something which the Labor Party recently discovered after putting up at a press conference a worker from a major supermarket who claimed to be affected by this change but in fact was not affected by this change, in addition to being a Labor Party branch member and volunteer. No other industries are affected. This is important. The commission specifically said in its decision that it sets no precedent for other workers who work on weekends, such as nurses or emergency service workers. You may be forgiven, having listened to Senator Polley's contribution earlier, for not realising that that is the case, but Senator Polley did not truthfully reflect the statement made by the commission. Affected workers will still get weekend penalty rates, but Sunday rates will be brought closer into line with Saturday rates, which remain unchanged.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I have said before in a contribution to this debate that I find it very amusing to see the Labor Party defending Sunday penalty rates given that the historical reason for why people are paid more on a Sunday compared to a Saturday is that it was the Sabbath and it was deemed to be immoral to work on the Sabbath and we should discourage and, in fact, penalise people who wished to open their businesses and work on the Sabbath. I wonder, in 21st century Australia, in the multicultural, multiethnic, multireligious society that we are, where not everybody views Sunday as sacrosanct, as some Australians once did, whether it is still relevant and appropriate to pay much more on a Sunday than a Saturday. I look forward to hearing, in further contributions to this debate by senators who think that this decision was unjustified, why we need to protect the Sabbath, why religious doctrine should influence rates of pay and why Sunday is more special than Saturday.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">One important aspect of this change, though, is that it gives small businesses a better chance to compete on a more even footing with large businesses. We discovered recently just how unfairly the deck is stacked against small business, and that is because big unions and big businesses have been doing deals for a long time which have eroded Sunday rates of pay and allow them to pay far less per hour to their workers on Sundays, which makes it much more affordable for them to open on Sundays but makes it very difficult for small businesses to open on Sundays and still be profitable, let alone compete with these major businesses and chains. For example, a bed and breakfast must pay $10 an hour more than a five-star hotel; a family chicken shop must pay $8 more per hour than KFC; a family owned takeaway must pay $8 more per hour than McDonald's; a family greengrocer must pay $5 more per hour than Woolworths; a family pizza takeaway must pay $8 more an hour than Pizza Hut; a boutique clothes shop must pay $7 more an hour than David Jones; a family bookshop must pay $8 more an hour than Target; a family newsagent must pay $7 more an hour than Officeworks; a family bottle shop must pay $7 an hour more then Dan Murphy's; and a family hardware store must pay $5 more per hour than Bunnings. Is there anybody in this place who seriously thinks it is justified that small business should be bound and forced to pay significantly more—in some cases, 20, 30 or 40 per cent more—to hire and provide employment opportunities for their workers and provide services to their customers on Sunday than big businesses pay?</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Do we wonder why it is that a union would be willing to trade away the pay rates of their workers on a Sunday with a big business? What is the reason that a union would do that? Well, the modern union movement is a bit different from the union movement of old and the primary motivation of many union leaders today is very different to the motivation of union leaders in times past. They are primarily motivated today by the fact that the more members they have, the more votes they have in internal Labor Party forums. The more members they have, the more money they have to spend on running political campaigns to elect their mates. The more influence they have with the Labor Party, the better chance they and their mates have of finding their way up in this place after their careers as union officials. If they really cared about the workers they represent, and if they valued that more than they value a cosy working relationship with big business, which facilitates their ability to sign up workers and charge workers their union dues, they would instead never accept a cut to Sunday penalty rates and never accept trading off Sunday penalty rates for a cosy relationship with business. And, as we have discovered, occasionally, payments from those businesses to those unions in the midst of EBA negotiations, which, until the parliament hopefully deals with this matter, have been a matter which could be completely secret, concealed form union members and done as a deal behind closed doors by a union leader and a business and completely unbeknownst to workers.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">It is worrying in the extreme that the union movement is willing to make these trade-offs and that many of those former union officials, who are now Labor MPs, are now hypocritically saying that the Fair Work Commission should not be able to set up the kinds of arrangements that they themselves have entered into when they were union leaders. Bill Shorten is the best example of that. </span>
                </p>

This bill, introduced by the Labor Party, seeks to amend the Fair Work Act 2009 to ensure that awards cannot be varied to reduce the take-home pay of an employee, including any reduction in take-home pay as a result of a reduction in penalty rates, or the hours to which penalty rates apply. It will also prevent decision AM2014/305 of the Fair Work Commission from taking effect. </span>

However, it should be noted that this bill is an act of gross hypocrisy by a party whose own leader, Mr Bill Shorten, has been responsible for the erosion of penalty rates through crooked, secret deals to create enterprise bargaining agreements when he was a union leader that do exactly the same thing. </span>

                    </a>  As a former National Secretary of the AWU between 2001 and 2007, Victorian State Secretary from 1998 to 2007, and Victorian state president of the Labor Party from 2005 until 2008, the honourable Labor leader was a person of great interest to the royal commission into union corruption. The royal commission into union corruption heard that Mr Shorten accepted and failed to disclose large donations to himself from employers while negotiating for the union on behalf of employees—secret commissions to rip off his fellow union members. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The Leader of the Opposition admitted to the commission that he had failed to declare a political donation of around $40,000 from a labour hire company in the lead-up to the 2007 election campaign and that invoices regarding the payments for services were not truthful. Mr Shorten, however, claimed to have no knowledge of false invoicing totalling more than $300,000, which had been sent to construction company Thiess John Holland—a very convenient form of collective amnesia. These so-called donations were undeclared, because they were a pay-off—a pay-off to agree to lowering the wages and conditions of his already poorly-paid union members. No wonder he wanted them kept secret. So let us be clear: the leader of a major union and now the self-styled leader of the so-called workers party took secret commissions from employers to sell his own union members down the river. </span>
                </p>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">During the royal commission into trade union corruption, under cross-examination, counsel assisting and the commissioner, Mr Heydon QC, said that the honourable Leader of the Opposition was being 'evasive' and 'non- responsive'. Evasive and unresponsive—it is hardly surprising, is it? I mean, if he was honest, he would have to admit that he had betrayed his fellow union members, just like Craig Thomson, Michael Williamson and Kathy Jackson.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">On Mr Shorten's watch as AWU secretary, massive conflicts of interest and ripping off his own AWU members in crooked side deals with employers like Cleanevent were the order of the day—in fact, precisely the kind of moral corruption that the government's fair work amendment bill sought to outlaw. Now he has the gross hypocrisy to denounce the Fair Work Commission decision to reduce penalty rates. Such blatant hypocrisy is almost unbelievable. Can you imagine this man as Prime Minister? Even the small change you keep from the laundromat would not be safe left lying around. How on earth can Labor senators denounce the Fair Work Commission's decision with a straight face, knowing that their leader has done exactly the same thing on the sly? Have you no shame?</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I ask you, my fellow senators: what does this say about Labor senators who support this man as their leader? Even the opposition leader's predecessor, former Prime Minister Paul Keating, has given a damning indictment of Labor's performance under the stewardship of Mr Shorten. In a recent biography, which can be found today in the remainder bins of all the best bookshops, Mr Keating was quoted as saying that the Labor Party under Mr Shorten had lost its way and that unions under leaders such as the former head of the AWU, Mr Shorten, lacked the focus on the national interest they once had. In a rare moment of clarity, Mr Keating observed that under the leadership of Mr Shorten Labor has 'a leadership deficit'. But I would go further. I would say the Leader of the Opposition has a credibility deficit. Where are you when we need you, Ben Chifley and John Curtin? Today you would be standing with us as One Nation senators.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">There is a Sicilian saying: a fish rots from the head. This is exactly what we see with the current Labor Party. A political leader who, whilst a union official, took secret commissions to sell out his own fellow union members creates a culture in which nefarious and venal behaviour by unions becomes acceptable.</span>

                    <span class="HPS-OfficeInterjecting">The DEPUTY PRESIDENT:</span>  Senator Roberts, I again remind you of the statement I read from the President about imputations. I would again ask you consider withdrawing that.</span>

                    </a>  I withdraw, Madam Deputy President. Suddenly the former party of workers has found itself in league with criminal thugs, and that has been verified in the Heydon commission. The CFMEU is a case in point. Last year around 100 CFMEU thugs were prosecuted or were facing prosecution for wreaking havoc on the nation's building sites, accused of more than 1,000 industrial breaches. The CFMEU and its officials have also been fined a total of around $7 million for industrial breaches which have been dealt with by the courts since 2002. Those brought before the courts have included the CFMEU's national secretary, Michael O'Connor, brother of Labor's shadow minister for employment and workplace relations, no less. They have also included construction division head David Noonan and New South Wales and Queensland secretaries Brian Parker and Michael Ravbar. 'Violence', 'extortion', 'blackmail' and 'intimidation' are words used repeatedly in the media and in the Heydon commission. Court case after court case has shown that this union is so corrupt that it makes the teamsters union under Jimmy Hoffa look like the Sisters of Mercy.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I am sure there are some decent and honest Labor senators here, and they privately are appalled by the conduct of CFMEU thugs and feel just as strongly as I do that this corruption must be brought to book. In fact, some have said so, but they are silenced by a Labor leadership that has its own history of union corruption and is beholden to corrupt union bosses even now.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">What wider opposition to last year's registered organisations commission bill revealed, however, is how the corrupt tentacles of this organisation have spread to non-Labor organisations which the CFMEU has bribed and co-opted to its cause. The CFMEU tentacles reach into parties in this chamber and individual members. However, the reach of the CFMEU's tentacles does not stop there. In 2010 alone, the CFMEU donated $1.2 million to extreme left-wing activist group GetUp!—</span>

                    </a>  I certainly am, Madam Deputy President. Thank you. However, the reach of the CFMEU's tentacles does not stop there. In 2010 alone the CFMEU donated $1.2 million to extreme left-wing activist group GetUp!, one of whose founding board members was Mr Bill Shorten, and at least two so-called Independents in this parliament are receiving union funding.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We see, in fact, that the priority of CFMEU bosses is not their members' jobs, which they happily sacrifice, but the protection of nefarious CFMEU officials from scrutiny and prosecution for their crimes. I make the point that this party is sacrificing coalminers' jobs in the state of Queensland and sacrificing, as I will explain in a minute, small businesses and union members. We have seen even the new head of the ACTU, Sally McManus, publicly state that unions do not need to comply with the law. Sadly, this approach is very much a case study of the Leader of the Opposition's model of industrial governance.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">So let's take a closer look at the opposition leader and what he did for his fellow union members whilst head of the AWU. In 2004, Mr Shorten signed an enterprise bargaining agreement—and this is where I am coming back to—with Cleanevent that allowed them to work staff around the clock for up to 12 hours at a time and up to 60 hours a week without award penalties or loadings. Any honest union leader would have known that this agreement was against the interests of their members and a sweeter deal for their employer—but not Mr Shorten. The opposition leader has previously boasted that he 'always improved workers' conditions', but just this one agreement shows that this claim is false. For the hapless low-paid workers at Clean Event, things just got worse under Mr Shorten. When this rip-off EBA expired, the Labor leader exploited John Howard's Work Choices laws to negotiate another deal with the company which ripped off another $2 million from his workers' pay packets.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Why on earth would a union leader do this? Why would he sell out the very workers he was supposed to be elected to defend? The answer is self-interest. Clean Event gave $40,000 to Mr Shorten's subsequent election campaign. The Heydon royal commission also uncovered other payments. Visy Packaging paid the AWU $190,000 in return for EBA deals that grossly underpaid its workers. And so it goes on and on.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Of course, these are not isolated cases. Mr Shorten was not the only union leader selling out his own members. Around 250,000 Australian workers are being underpaid with below-award rates negotiated by union bosses like Mr Shorten in return for crooked payments from employers. This costs mainly low-paid workers around $300 million a year. Quite a number of the union bosses who sold out their members with these rip-off EBAs have gone on to be elected to parliament, just like Mr Shorten—leading the workers from behind a brandy balloon. These rip-off EBAs failed the 'better off overall' test but have been approved because corrupt union officials and the big businesses who bribe them have colluded to fool the Fair Work Commission into approving them.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Let us consider the example of McDonald's workers. Instead of receiving the award rate of $29.16 per hour on a Sunday, their workers get just $21.08 per hour thanks to a union-sanctioned rip-off EBA. That is a 27 per cent pay cut for McDonald's workers courtesy of their own union bosses. KFC and Pizza Hut are much the same. On Sundays their workers get only $21.09 and $20.35 per hour respectively. They are all giant foreign-owned corporations, all getting sweetheart deals to rip off Aussie workers. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">But the local family-run milk bar that tries to compete with them does not get to pay those rates. No, they still have to pay the $29.16 per hour, so how on earth can they compete with giant multinational chain stores? I wonder how much tax they are paying. As the leader of our party has raised many times, and as I have, they cannot compete. That is why the small businesses are going out of business. Family-owned corner stores are disappearing fast, thanks in great part to the opposition leader and his corrupt union mates.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Let us look at clothing stores. On Sundays David Jones pays $29.53 per hour, but family-owned boutiques and shoe shops have to pay $37.05 per hour. Then there are hotels. International hotels, like the Sheraton or the Hilton, get to pay their workers just $21.63 per hour on a Sunday, while family-owned bed and breakfasts have to pay $31.87.

Notice the pattern: big businesses, typically foreign-owned giant multinationals, get to pay up to a third lower wages than local Aussie family businesses thanks to the likes of Mr Shorten and his ilk. The tentacles of Labor's rip-off EBAs reach throughout the retail and hospitality sectors, ripping off the lowest-paid Aussie workers and wrecking Aussie small businesses while giving a leg up to the big end of town. In return, these mostly foreign-owned big businesses give millions in kickbacks, secret commissions, to the corrupt union bosses, which they then pass on in contributions to the Labor Party.

I did quote to you the statement made by the President earlier this week. Senator Marshall has raised standing order No. 203, which clearly does go to the issue of not taking note of what the chair is suggesting. It does leave the final matter to the President. I will ask the President to have a look at what has occurred today. It is obvious that an imputation is clear when you link the word 'corrupt', or any of the other words, to senators or indeed to a particular party—it also extends. I would ask you not to use that language in the remainder of your speech, and I will ask the President to review. The President will come back to the chamber if he thinks it is necessary. Thank you.</span>

One Nation is committed both to supporting Aussie workers and to helping small businesses compete. To this end, I foreshadow that we will be moving an amendment to Labor's bill, to extend the protection against the loss of penalty rates to existing EBAs. Under One Nation's amendment, 250,000 low-paid workers will immediately obtain a pay increase of up to 30 per cent for weekend and public holiday work, and small business will immediately get a level playing field on which to compete with giant foreign-owned multinationals.</span>

Are you finally going to do the right thing for all those unionised workers on your rip-off EBAs that give them the same pay as they would get from small businesses, or are you going to show yourselves to be the world-class contradictors that you appear to be and actually vote against giving low-paid workers the pay rise they deserve? I will be moving that amendment at the appropriate stage. Finally, after all the deception, the ducking and weaving and the contradictory cant, Labor is cornered and has to make a choice. We are looking forward to seeing which way Labor jumps.</span>

                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">South Australia</span>—<span class="HPS-MinisterialTitles">Deputy Leader of the Opposition in the Senate</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">12:02</span>):  I was in the chamber last week when Senator Seselja recounted his youth working for Woolworths. Madam Deputy President, you may recall that two days ago I referred to his claim. I will read the words again. I hate repeating this, but it probably needs to be repeated in order to explain his contribution. He said:</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">They sold me out on penalty rates. I think we got time and a half in the nineties on a Sunday. I was young. I was 19 and I joined the SDA in good faith, hoping they would do me a good deal. It turned out like so many others in the union movement and like Mr Shorten: they sold me and thousands of other workers out as well.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Madam Deputy President, you may recall that I thought that that was wrong, mistaken. I went away to have a look at whether or not Senator Seselja's comments were correct. What we discovered when we did that examination was that Senator Seselja did mislead the Senate. He was not sold out by that great trade union, the SDA. In fact, the opposite had occurred. In fact, his terms and conditions were better than the relevant award. If Senator Seselja was a part-timer back then, he was something like 5.4 per cent better off under an agreement negotiated by the SDA. If he was a casual employee, depending on what sort of assumptions you make, he was anywhere between five and 11.8 per cent better off. As far as I can see, Senator Seselja has not come back into the chamber to correct the misleading of the Senate. I am disappointed about that because I have now got to raise the issue again. I think that when mistakes are made they should be corrected.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">It has been a long time since Senator Seselja worked in the retail industry. Almost 20 years has gone past. I would like to give a little potted history of what has happened to wages and conditions, particularly in the retail industry, over that period of time, and what Senator Seselja's party has done over the last 20 years—or fractionally longer than 20 years. After World War II, there was a social compact between business and the unions, that they accepted the Australian industrial relations system. That broke down in the late eighties, with the election of the Greiner government in New South Wales. For the first time, that social compact was broken, and Liberal governments started the long, slow process to what finally ended up as Work Choices. They started reducing and removing the ability of unions and workers to work in the industrial relations system and started winding back all the hard-won conditions that unions had achieved for their members over the history of the Conciliation and Arbitration Act. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">It started with Greiner. Then Premier Kennett in Victoria was elected. He went quite a bit further than Mr Greiner. He basically abolished the awards system in Victoria, so workers went from one day having a set of terms and conditions under awards to having basically a voluntary employment agreement. Again, all of those hard-won terms and conditions that workers had been able to achieve through their unions were suddenly thrown out the door in one fell swoop of legislation. Kennett went even further when John Howard was elected in 1996. He actually abolished the entire Victorian industrial relations system and handed it all over to Mr Howard, and we saw similar Greiner and Kennett events occur in other states. In my home state of South Australia, Dean Brown was elected, and he moved down a very similar path.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Unions in the retail industry were predominantly state based, and the reason why Senator Seselja is so mistaken is that he does not understand that little, basic principle. But, when the state governments started making these changes, the unions made a strategic decision to shift out of the old state systems into the federal system. It might be argued, 10 years later, that they had jumped out of the frying pan into the fire. But you had to look after and protect your members, and Keating had won that election in 1993, so unions made that change into the federal system. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The tragedy was that John Howard then won the next election, and we discovered that Mr Reith was Minister for Industrial Relations. He started to carry out the Greiner, Kennett and Brown type of industrial relations structure. He did not get as far as he wanted to go; let us be clear about that. Labor and the minor parties in the Senate were able to stop him from going as far as he wanted to go. But, again, he started that whole process of reducing workers' terms and conditions.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Then we come to 2004, and suddenly all John Howard's dreams have come true. Not only does he control—</span>

                    <span class="HPS-OfficeInterjecting">The DEPUTY PRESIDENT:</span>  Senator Farrell, I remind you to refer to people in the other place and former leaders by their correct titles, thank you.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">
                    <a href="I0N" type="MemberContinuation">
                      <span class="HPS-MemberContinuation">Senator FARRELL:</span>
                    </a>  Yes—former Prime Minister John Howard. He gets a majority in the Senate, and he is able to implement his perfect dream in terms of industrial relations. Madam Deputy President, you may recall the name of this particular product. It was called an AWA, an Australian workplace agreement. These AWAs removed all of the fundamental terms and conditions that workers had won over the entire history of the industrial relations system in Australia. For the purposes of the debate, I recount the sorts of things that were taken away under these Australian workplace agreements. Seventy per cent of workers lost shift loadings, 68 per cent lost annual leave loadings, 65 per cent lost penalty rates, 49 per cent lost overtime loadings and 45 per cent no longer had public holidays. That was the result of Work Choices for Australian workers.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I make this comparison between Work Choices and the decision of the full bench of the Fair Work Commission on the most recent penalty rate cut. Work Choices was a slow-moving product. There was no immediate change, not overnight. Of course, the Australian population woke up to Work Choices, and Prime Minister Howard was defeated in the 2007 election as a result. In fact, former Prime Minister Howard lost his own seat in that election. The Australian community understood the unfairness of Work Choices. But there is quite a bit of difference between what happened under Work Choices and what is happening now, following the decision by the Fair Work Commission. This is a cold and heartless decision, and 700,000 Australians will lose up to $77 a week as a result. As I said, Work Choices was a slow-moving change. This will not be slow. It is not contained. Whenever this decision is finalised, that is what is going to happen: there will be a dramatic effect on the income of people amongst the lowest paid in our country.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">So, over that whole time, we can see a clear pattern in the way in which those opposite have dealt with industrial relations. Bit by bit, every time they got an opportunity, they sought to take away the terms and conditions of workers in this country. Unions, great unions like the SDA, have had to deal with those sets of changes for all that time. What did they do in those 20 years, since the time Senator Seselja was five or 10 per cent better off under his agreement? They kept working away to ensure that those workers continued to get those hard-won benefits.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I am not sure which particular Woolworths store Senator Seselja worked in, but the agreement would have covered it, and, if he were working for a Woolworths store today, his weekly rate of pay—I am not talking about the casual or the part-time rate—would be about $100 higher than the equivalent award. Not only that but there are guaranteed wage rises, nine per cent wage increases, locked in over three years; and higher junior rates of pay. Workers in the retail industry, for almost its entire history, did not get adult rates until they were 21 years of age. Under the Woolworths agreement they get the adult rate at 20 years of age. In terms of benefits, there is public holiday work, all voluntary; there are much better rostering provisions than apply under the award, and they take into account family responsibilities; greater compassionate leave, significantly higher than under the award; longer breaks of 15 minutes per four hours rather than the 10 minutes under the award; extra days of personal leave; better overtime provisions—I could go on. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The point of all that is that, over that 20-year period, those unions have sat down and negotiated with some pretty hard companies. That is one thing I agree with Senator Roberts about: you are dealing with pretty hard companies here when you are dealing with some of these national and international companies. But the unions have managed, over that time, to maintain the wages and conditions of employees.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">If I understand Senator Roberts correctly, his complaint is that, when you look at some of these agreements and you look specifically at the rate of pay that people get for Sunday, it is lower than under other awards. That is true. He says there is something untoward about that. There is nothing untoward about that. That is the way enterprise bargaining has worked in this country for 25 years. Workers, through their unions, sit down with companies and negotiate about their terms and conditions.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I have just been through the Woolworths agreement to show just how much better off you would be under a Woolworths agreement than if you were under an award. What the employers in this industry who are not subject to enterprise bargaining agreements want to do is cherrypick these agreements. They say: 'There's something we like in this agreement, and we're going to take it out. We just want that bit.' For years the SDA heard this complaint from the small retailers that Senator Roberts was talking about, and we said, 'Okay, if you want the same arrangements as a Coles or a Woolworths'—I could go through a similar explanation with Coles—'if you want these terms and conditions, you pick up the totality of the agreement.' So the union in South Australia—the SDA, that great union that I have referred to—sat down with Business SA, representing all of the small employers that Senator Roberts was talking about, and they reached an agreement that gave them a lower penalty rate on Sunday in exchange for all of the improved benefits that you would get if you worked for Coles or Woolworths or one of these other employers. They said, 'This agreement is now open to any small business that wants to come and sign up.'</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">That was two years ago. How many small businesses took it up? A hundred in that two-year period? Ten? You might think 10. One? No, zero. Not one small business took up the offer to move to a Coles- or a Woolworths-type agreement. Why not? We asked the question: why not? It was because they were going to pay more than if they stayed under the award. So these people have stayed under the award and complained about the penalty rates on Sundays, saying they are missing out.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">What does the full bench do? To my great disappointment, the full bench sides with these small employers and decides overnight to reduce the terms and conditions of penalty rates on Sunday for these workers, some of the lowest-paid workers in this country. The employers get what they want. They do not have to negotiate now about higher wages, better leave provisions, better bereavement leave provisions, better rostering provisions and better public holiday provisions. They do not have to do that. You might ask yourself: what is an employer who has done an agreement like the Coles agreement or the Woolworths agreement going to say? I will tell you what they are going to say: 'We don't need enterprise agreements anymore. We can just fall back to the award. We've got everything we want, and we can reduce the wages of our staff.'</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">You might have listened to Senator Xenophon—perhaps you did not—on the radio in Adelaide last week. What was his solution to this? His solution to this—and he may have changed his position—was to say, 'Well, let's keep all of the people who are under the award on their current terms and conditions, but any new employee goes to the lower rate.' Let me tell you—I have had a considerable period of experience in the retail industry—what that means. Most of these workers who work Sundays, let us be honest about it—except if they are in a Coles agreement or a Woolworths agreement—are casual employees. They will simply be replaced. They will not be called up. So not only will they lose their penalty rate; they will lose their job, if that is the solution that the commission finally comes up with. They will not be called anymore, because their rate is 50 per cent higher than somebody who would only get time and half. They will not be called in to work. So not only is it a cut in your penalty rate; you actually lose your job. So that is not a solution to the problem.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">How do we deal with this problem that we are now faced with? There is only one way to deal with it, and that is to restore the penalty rates as they were. That is what our leader, Bill Shorten, has proposed to do. That is the right answer, and I am getting the impression now from reading the paper that all of the other parties are starting to come back to that position. If you do not do that, then there is no point to enterprise bargaining in this country in the retail and hospitality industries—there is no point whatsoever. No company is going to have a negotiation about an enterprise agreement if they get what they want through a reduction in the award. It totally wipes out 25 years of industrial relations history.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">It is true that we are overturning a decision of Fair Work, but Labor has done that before, Deputy President. Can I remind you of this. It was done during Prime Minister Paul Keating's time. The unions had argued for a 12 per cent superannuation payment to workers in this country. To everybody's surprise, the full bench of the commission said: 'No. We're not going to award this. We're not going to support any arrangement to introduce improved superannuation.' The ACTU and the unions went to the government and said, 'We want you to fix this.' And, instantaneously, Prime Minister Paul Keating said, 'Yes, I will.' The decision was overturned, and we now have in this country the best superannuation scheme in the world as a result of that decision to overturn a Fair Work decision.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We need to do the same now. We need to reverse this decision. We need to overturn the decision. We need to restore enterprise bargaining to this country, and we need to get back the penalty rates that these workers have now lost.</span>

I want to be very clear about why the Greens are supporting this bill and why we have led this debate. If I can in the time that I have got, I also want to blow away some of the myths that have been thrown around the chamber rather carelessly this morning. It does not reduce the independence of the umpire. All it does is prevent the commission from reducing people's living standards. It prevents people from being forced to go backwards, it provides a floor underneath penalty rates and it secures them as a safety net for the people who need them the most.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">After this bill clears the Senate, the only really significant change that will occur is that some of Australia's most vulnerable workers will not be forced to go backward. The remarkable defence that we have heard of the Fair Work Commission's untimely and extremely unfortunate decision from some of those in the Liberal Party and One Nation—I will just concentrate my thoughts on the Liberals for the time being—have been just extraordinary and expose the psychology of the people who are defending the Fair Work Commission's decision.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Many people—particularly young people and particularly women—across this country rely on penalty rates to survive, to make ends meet. That means paying rent from week to week, putting food on the table or servicing a mortgage, and right now the rules of the Fair Work Commission allow the commission to reduce people's living standards and take them backwards. We think that that is beyond unfortunate, but it is something that this parliament can do something about today.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The politics of the debate are exquisite, and we have seen a caricature of Auspoll 2017 play out around this bill this morning. We have got the one per cent floating around on yachts in Sydney Harbour, tapping out submissions to the Fair Work Commission on why the people who will be serving their coffee and their cocktails when they make landfall should be paid less. That is the perversion here: Tories earning hundreds of thousands or millions of dollars a year saying that Australia's lowest paid workers are making too much money. They run the same arguments by the same blue bloods around the minimum wage, which is another matter that is obviously front of mind today. So that is your Liberal-National Party: the people on the most precarious forms of employment in the country, earning some of the lowest wages in the country, are making too much money, and that is why this decision should be upheld.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">One Nation—goodness only knows. They have had three positions on penalty rates in three days. I have no idea what head or tail to make of Senator Roberts's speech from earlier that circulated amendments which he barely even glanced over. He spent no part of his contribution talking about penalty rates. He went on one of his fevered rants about the evils of the trade union movement. So they are utterly incoherent on this issue. If they end up supporting the bill, that will be great—it is another four votes—but we simply do not trust Pauline Hanson's party to look after the interests of the lowest paid Australians, and the shambles over the last couple of days has been an ample demonstration of why.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The Australian Greens took a commitment to the 2016 election to put a floor under penalty rates. I have got to say it was a bit surprising and disappointing that, at the time, we were mocked for it. I will go into a little bit of detail in a second. Within 24 hours of the Fair Work Commission decision being announced, Mr Adam Bandt, the member for Melbourne, who has led this debate all along, released our bill and wrote to the Labor Party, requesting support. Two days later Labor introduced their own bill. All right, whatever. What happened, though, when in the run-up to the 2016 election we warned that this was going to happen and the member for Melbourne, Adam Bandt, introduced the bill? Mr Shorten said, 'Oh, you don't need to do that, because, yes, there is a theoretical prospect that the commission may cut penalty rates, but what if alien life makes contact with earth?' Well, earth to Bill: the aliens have made contact, we have heard from a number of them this morning and, yes, a bill such as this is absolutely necessary and warranted.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The reason that we are doing this is that the Australian workforce is increasingly casualised. Many of these people are falling into an underclass. We have heard of the working poor: people working but in poverty, a precarious existence getting by from week to week. These are the people whose lives are on the table and under discussion this morning. There are not that many of them actually present in this debate, quite frankly. Every person who has spoken on this bill this morning is earning something in the realm of $200,000 a year, and I suspect that the people who are speaking in support of the Fair Work Commission's decision have never worked a day in their lives where penalty rates were actually determining whether they could make the rent or whether they would have to sacrifice something else.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">It is a quarter of the Australian workforce. It is not an accident. It is a global dynamic to drive wages down and profits up. It is not an unfamiliar dynamic. The ACTU secretary, Sally McManus, who made a blazing speech to the National Press Club this week, pointed out yesterday that wage theft is a business model for too many employers—not all of them, obviously, but many. That is why we need these laws.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Casual workers are defined as those without paid leave entitlements that people in here, many of whom have probably spent their entire lives as a beneficiary, take for granted. This is temporary, part-time and self-employed workers accounting for around a third of all employment in OECD countries, and who are these people? Nearly 70 per cent of them are women. Sixty-nine per cent of all part-time employees in Australia are women, according to the Workplace Gender Equality Agency, and that is probably because for many women with kids casual work is the only option. Women are the majority of accommodation, food service and retail workers. That is who is in here. Not a lot of women have spoken up from the Tory benches this morning, you will notice. Interesting; it has been all blokes—mostly IPA muppets, but we will leave that till later. These people are largely voiceless and unrecognised in these debates.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Because of these inequalities that are already baked into the way that our economy, tax system and politics are structured, cuts to penalty rates are particularly cruel. We should not even be having this debate. This could have been handled in a cross-party way, but instead we have brought it to the Senate today.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">As the new ACTU secretary pointed out yesterday, wage theft is a business model for too many employers—many but not all. There are plenty of good examples of businesses who have no interest in exploiting their employees or driving wages and conditions down. Senator Rhiannon and I looked one up in the run-up to this debate, the Eltham Valley Pantry in Byron Bay, who facebooked the fact that they had no intention of cutting their employees' penalty rates, even though the Fair Work Commission decision would make them legally entitled to do so. They have explained their reasoning for why they are doing that, and it is driving business to them. This is not an attack on employers who want to do the right thing by their employees. We need a safety net. We need a floor, not for the good employers but for those who see their employees as components, as business units, as costs to be cut no matter what. That is why we are legislating this morning. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The speed with which the Attorney-General chopped through the hours motion a short time ago meant that Senator Rhiannon could not bring this motion forward, but I just want to bring the Senate's attention to it. There was an amendment that Senator Rhiannon had tabled on the motion around our hours of meeting. We are probably going to sit until late into the night, and that is reasonably well understood by everybody in here. But here is the fascinating thing. There are a number of trade union campaigners who, in the wake of the Fair Work Commission decision, visited the premises of those who had argued the most fiercely that Sunday penalty rates should be cut, and guess what they discovered? They visited the hoteliers association, the master grocers, the Chamber of Commerce and Industry—this is mostly in Victoria—Clubs Australia, the Pharmacy Guild, the Australian Industry Group and a whole pile of tory electorate offices on a Sunday, and guess what they found? Their offices were all closed so that those people could spend time with their families and maybe go to a coffee shop, grab a cup of coffee and be served by somebody earning Sunday penalty rates. What Senator Rhiannon's motion did, somewhat cheekily but to the point, was move that we would adjourn without debate at 10.30 pm tonight if the bills listed are not done and the business of this place is yet to be conducted, and that we would reconvene on Sunday, 2 April 2017.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Some employers and people have argued that Sunday penalty rates should be cut, as Senator Paterson did, not that long ago. There is nothing special about Sundays anymore, yet all their electorate offices were closed on a Sunday when these campaigners visited. That is the scale of the seething hypocrisy that we are dealing with. It would be so interesting to take a straw poll, and it is a shame we cannot put it to a vote, as to how many on this side of the chamber would be interested in coming back here and working on a Sunday. I don't think there would be many takers, quite frankly. That is why we pay people a premium to work on Sundays or late into the night. That is what penalty rates are for.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I was waiting with interest—and I had to sit through Senator Roberts's contribution, which is rarely memorable but always a little bit strange—for some amendments that One Nation had circulated for us to consider. I guess imitation is the sincerest form of flattery: they appear to be basically cut and pasted from Mr Bandt's Fair Work Amendment (Pay Protection) Bill 2017, which is before the Senate. So thank you for taking the time to cut and paste out of our bill. Therefore, I do not have anything seriously critical to say about it. The bill seeks to protect workers, and I will just fill you in on the nature of Senator Roberts's amendments, because he was too busy slagging off the CFMEU to do so. I will tell you what the One Nation amendments seek to do. They seek to protect workers in the fast food and retail industry. That is great. The Greens have been campaigning to look after the fast food and retail industry workers for a while, and we welcome One Nation's sudden interest in these issues.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Obviously, we will not be supporting the amendments, because blasting amendments through on the same day is really not how business is done in here. These are actually quite complex matters and people's lives and livelihoods are in the balance. We will be referring our bill on these issues, that One Nation have at the last minute cut and pasted from, to a Senate inquiry, and Senator Roberts is very welcome to show up, if he likes, to hear the evidence for and against these amendments. We will be proceeding with them in the way business is normally done in here. Obviously, One Nation senators are welcome to show up at that, but we will not be supporting the amendments in this place today or the rather odd way in which they have been welded on to a tremendously important bill.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">As I said at the outset, the politics of the way this debate has been conducted and the contributions of the tories and indeed everybody else in this chamber has provided a rather miserable caricature of the state of the debate around the economy, the purpose of the economy and the way that we support and look after everyone in this country. We should look after them no matter how much they are earning or which private school they may not have been able to get into or their situation of employment.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I find it incredibly galling, revealing and illuminating that the same people who are arguing that Australia's lowest-paid workers deserve a pay cut and that it should not be the business of this parliament to put a floor under those pay and conditions are the same people who argue for the maintenance of capital gains tax so that they can continue amassing property portfolios. They are the same people who argue that negative gearing should stay in place so that they can just tuck away and capitalise their income in multiple property portfolios. They are the same people who argue that superannuation should basically be yet another tax shelter. They are the same people who are demanding tax cuts and actually got them last year for people in the highest tax brackets. They are the same people who later on tonight are going to be arguing for a $50 billion tax cut to corporations. It is a vicious, deliberate double standard in play, and the funny thing is that they only ever call it class warfare when we fight back. Call it what you will, but today we are fighting back, and when this bill is committed to a vote it is very likely to pass. Get used to it.</span>

                    </a> (Tasmania) (12:35):  I rise to speak on the Fair Work Amendment (Protecting Take-Home Pay) Bill 2017. The decision to cut penalty rates is a terrible blow to some 700,000 Australians. It is indeed a terrible blow to all Australians. It is a terrible blow particularly to thousands of Tasmanians in my home state. In fact, it is a terrible blow to some 40,246 Tasmanians employed in retail, food and accommodation services in Tasmania, who will be worse off if this legislation passes in the way the government chooses. It will take thousands of dollars from their annual wage, and that is what we are arguing about here.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We are arguing about whether we are a country that wants to take thousands of dollars from some of the lowest paid workers, who are trying to make ends meet. It will impact on their ability to afford the basic necessities of life. These people already have to make impossible choices about whether to pay their overdue rent or buy food for their kids. The Turnbull government are never going to understand the stress of not being able to afford to pay your bills and having to skip meals in order to make ends meet. They do not know, nor do they care, about the people doing it tough.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I am the proud daughter of a hospitality worker. As a single parent my mum relied on penalty rates. As a single parent my mum worked really hard to provide for me. She worked really hard to provide for both of us. She was a proud union member. She knew that her union supported her—and that her union supported workers like her—in protecting wages and conditions so that she could make ends meet, so that she could pay her rent and could pay for food for me and her. I stand with all of the hospitality workers and all of the single parents like my mum who need penalty rates. Labor stands with those workers in the retail, food and beverage, hospitality and other sectors that rely on penalty rates. Without those penalty rates life will indeed get very difficult for them.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I too worked in the hospitality sector when I was a young mum and putting myself through university. I relied on penalty rates. The Austudy I received at that time was certainly not enough to pay the rent and to ensure my family, with a young baby, had enough to get through while I continued to study. My life experience is like the life experience of those on this side of the chamber. They understand what it is like to do it tough and how necessary it is to have decent wages and conditions in order for families to provide for their own. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">That is what this decision is all about. It is a decision that will cost the budget bottom line up to $650 million, will drive down income tax revenue and will drive up welfare costs, yet it is another example of this Turnbull government's attacks on Australians who can least afford it. It will hurt Tasmania's most vulnerable workers. I stand, as I know other Tasmanian Labor senators do, with those Tasmanian workers. Some Tasmanian workers have contacted my office and told me what will happen to them and what is already happening when they try to make ends meet for their family. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">At the moment inequality in Australia is at a 70-year high, wages growth is at a historic low and underemployment is at a record high. People want to work more because they need to make ends meet. I was contacted by a number of Tasmanians concerned that they would no longer be able to meet basic housing, food and transport costs. One particular Tasmanian stood out to me. He works full time as a sheet metal tradesman. He has now had to pick up a second job to provide for his family. He works 12 days out of 14, missing significant time with his family. His penalty rates are not a luxury. His penalty rates are helping him provide for his family and make ends meet.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">These cuts will have a major impact on the wellbeing of Tasmanians who work so hard to provide for their families. Is this really the kind of society that the Australian government wants to put in place? Is this the kind of legacy that the Turnbull government wants to have in its wake? Does it want to be the government that cut penalty rates? I recently had some experience of what the American system is like for hospitality workers. These days that system completely relies on tips, on the goodwill of the customer. The minimum wage is so low, despite some work to lift it under President Barack Obama, that those workers rely on tips. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Is that the kind of society that we want here in Australia where we no longer have a safety net, where we have the Americanisation of our wages and conditions? I say no. Labor says no. We do not want that sort of system here in Australia. We do not want it in health care and we certainly do not want it in our wages and conditions, our workplace relations. I believe what the Turnbull government is trying to achieve here is the thin end of the wedge.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Labor, who are on this side of the chamber, will stand with the workers of Australia. We will stand with the low-income workers of Australia. We will stand with the families of Australia and with workers like the sheet metal worker I just described in Tasmania, who has had to take a second job in order to make ends meet. We will do something about inequality in this country. Inequality is so high, yet it is not even a thought bubble in the Prime Minister's purview, because he simply does not care. He does not care because he is out of touch and has not experienced what it is like nor does he want to reach out and meet people with that experience. That just shows you that this government has completely lost its way. Attacking some of the lowest workers in the country and attacking the basic safety net of penalty rates is simply appalling, and this government should hang its head in shame.</span>

                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Queensland</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">12:53</span>):  As I have said about section 18C of the Racial Discrimination Act, it is not in keeping with what I believe the majority of the people want. In listening to talkback radio and to other people who come up to me in the streets and in my office, people want what is right. They want to be able to have an opinion. They want to be able to voice their concern. As I said before—and I have said it repeatedly—about the word 'offend', not everyone likes the way other cultures dress, their music, the way they dance or whatever. If you make a comment like that, that other person may be offended by it. Is that enough grounds to take them before the courts for racial discrimination? I do not believe so.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Let us put it in the true context of what it is. Just two weeks ago, I had Bill Leak's widow and son come to visit me, in support of my stance against 18C. Johannes saw the stress that his father went through. His widow was so distraught about having lost her husband, and so she should be. They saw the stress that he was put under, with the challenges upon him, and it did have an impact on his health. They came to see me because they knew my stance against 18C and they encouraged me and others to stand up for this. Johannes said, when his father drew the cartoon, it was to send a message of what was happening in our society. It was not meant to be derogatory towards the Aboriginals—not in the slightest. He was basically saying, 'This is what is happening in our society; this is what is happening in some communities,' and that was his way of expressing it.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Isn't it funny that people who objected to the cartoon had to go out and try and find some people to complain about it? They actually went out of their way to find some people to complain about it. Is this what it is about—that you have to go and find people? What I am seeing these days in Australia is that those of the left with the socialist views are encouraging people to purposely go out and complain. I am hearing from a lot of different groups and organisations and people from different cultural backgrounds that they are not offended by this cartoon. If they are, let them stand up on their own two feet. Let them go and make a complaint. Do not find other people to go and make complaints for them and continually stir the pot. If I say anything that is derogatory or not in keeping with what the average person in Australia believes, they will judge me at the polling booth. That is what they have done and that is why I take my place here in this chamber with three other senators.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Freedom of speech is so very important. Criticism is not racism. This is all about having a debate about these issues, having your say and trying to find the right answers—and that is all Australians ask. Australians are not racist. Australians are very proud of their culture, their country and their heritage. Most Australians, including me, welcome others who have come here to this country for the freedom, the life that we have and our way of life. It is so precious to each and every one of us. Surely, we can all work together and in harmony and stop this rubbish that is going on in our country, pushed by the left side of politics.</span>

                      <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Senator DUNIAM</span>
                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Tasmania</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">12:58</span>):  I plan to make just a relatively brief contribution to this debate. It is a welcome opportunity, but I think enough has been said by others in the public domain and, indeed, in this debate on the Human Rights Legislation Amendment Bill 2017. There have been many views expressed throughout the debate, both publicly and here in parliament. I guess that is the beauty of what we are debating here—it is about the ability to express one's views freely without being impeded unnecessarily. Free speech is a wonderful thing and it is a cornerstone of our democracy. Many have said it and I am a firm believer in it. It is a quality that we have in this country. Freedom of speech is a freedom we have in this country that many others around the world envy because they do not have it. It is part of what makes this country so strong, in my view.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I want to take issue, though, with a few things that have been said during the debate. The point has been made that this is not an important issue. Prior to the debate coming on this week, a number of senators and members in the other place indicated that they felt that this issue was not important. I, fundamentally, reject that: I think it is an important issue, and so do many other people in the community—those who support it and those who are against it. It is an important issue to debate and, indeed, to send the message that this is not an important issue, I think, is a bad one. It is a message we are sending to the QUT students. It is a message we are sending to Bill Leak's family. To tell them that the plight of their suffering through the long-drawn out process that they have been subjected to is not important, I think, is a terrible message to send. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">So it is important, but it is an issue that is as important as the other issues that we have been dealing with. We have been looking at issues this week like company tax reform, tax breaks for small business to encourage investment. We had childcare reform last week. We have been dealing with issues of health; education; foreign policy; jobs and employment; energy security, and penalty rates—all these things have been debated in this place. What has annoyed me is that those people, who have been claiming that this issue is not important, have been trying to characterise this debate as the only thing on the government's agenda, and that is just not true. It is one of many things that have been debated and one of many things that people in our party room have been indicating they would like to discuss. I am glad we are doing that, along with all the other things that we are going to be spending a lot of hours tonight and, potentially, tomorrow debating. The government can walk and chew gum, and just to prove that—</span>

                    </a>  We can walk and chew gum, Senator Cameron, and I appreciate your contributions all the time. However, you know, we passed 12 bills through the Senate on Monday alone and, since the election, I am advised we have passed 83 bills. So to suggest that we cannot do anything—</span>

                      <span class="HPS-MemberContinuation">Senator DUNIAM:</span>
                    </a>  Well, passing bills is what we do here, and reducing regulation is a good thing too and many of those things, I hope, will do that, Senator Dastyari, through you, Mr Acting Deputy President Back. Some of the reforms we passed this week will make the childcare system better for people on the lower end of the income scale and our welfare system more sustainable through savings measures. But, as I say, to try and characterise this debate as the only thing on the government's agenda is mischievous and misleading. As I have said, it is not our only platform. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">During the debate, I was interested to hear of the test that is being applied to things that this parliament should deal with—that is, whether these issues are being discussed at barbecues. There are many things that this parliament deals with that people on the street do not discuss. There are issues—the mechanics of government, small reforms, streamlining of legislation, removal of red tape and regulation—which get dealt with here that the people of Australia do not sit at home and discuss. Just because they are not discussing it in every household and at every barbecue as a reason not to deal with this, is, I think, not a very good threshold for us to apply to the work that we should be doing in the Senate. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The point that is being made in relation to this legislation making it easier to be a racist in this country through supporting these reforms is a disappointing argument and, I think, a cheap one. The point was made in this debate in the previous contribution by another senator that Australians are better than what is being reflected in this debate. I suppose that is the point that I would like to make as well. Through the debate, those who are opposed to reform seem to be making the point that we need to protect Australia from itself—protect Australian people from themselves. I have to ask those who oppose reform: don't we trust the Australian people? </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">It was the same with the marriage plebiscite legislation: denying Australians the right to have their say and conduct a debate in the community. We wanted to prevent that from happening, because we did not trust the Australian people to do it in a fair and civilised manner. That is a pattern I do not support. I do have faith in the Australian people, and I think Australians can conduct themselves in a way that is fair and not going to bring about hatred and civil disputes. I think that we should, as a Senate, have faith in the Australian people. That is what is good about our country: the decency of the people who live here—and that is what the majority of people in Australia are like. Of course there is always the minority, but we have to have faith in the majority of the people who live here. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">For those opposed to reform, I just want to know why they do not have faith in the majority of Australians and why we need to regulate the behaviour of Australians when it comes to every facet of life. We are not a communist country, and we should not be trying to control every element of people's lives and everything that occurs in society under the guise of trying to protect people from themselves. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">As I said, there is a minority and, yes, we need to deal with them, but I do not think they should ruin it for everybody else. We have to, as I say, have faith in the majority, and that is what I believe these reforms intend to do. They will deal with those people who cause the problems, those who intend to do harm and racially vilify. I have to take issue, though, with a point made by Senator Watt in his contribution—I believe it was yesterday. Because the complainants lost in the cases that have been cited in the debate quite extensively—QUT and Bill Leak—therefore the laws are working and therefore they do not need to be changed. The point I make in response to that is: I have grave concerns about the way these processes went on for as long as they did. That is what many people are upset about. That is what the people who were subject to the complaint were upset about, and I think that is why we have having this debate. To have these drawn-out emotional rollercoaster events taking place in the lives of the targets of these complaints—I believe the changes target those problems and prevent them from happening into the future. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">It is about protecting freedom of speech, preventing vexatious complaints and protecting people at the same time from the racial hatred that every single person in this place does not want to see in our community. It is the behaviour we all hate and the behaviour that we want to see stamped out in our community. And that is what is caught in the provisions of this bill. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I mentioned in my first speech that I married someone from another country. My wife and her family, when they came to this country, could not speak English. They did not have any assets. They had the clothes on their backs, and that was effectively it. My wife's family, when they came out here, left a country, Albania, where they were not allowed to speak out on anything—on matters of politics, matters of religion or the most insignificant matters that we in this country can speak about freely, without fear of any repercussion. So I thought I would take the provisions of this bill and have a discussion with them. They have more insight into what it is like to be subject to racist slurs. Coming from another country and having had a poor grasp, in their initial years here in Australia, of the English language, they know what it is like to be subjected to racist slurs and comments of hate. So I thought it would be a good idea to have a discussion with them about the changes. Even more recently, though, I have to say they have been subjected to comments from members of our community, sadly, that many of us in this place would say were not the right thing to say to people from other countries, about their accents and where they have come from—'Go back where you've come from,' and those sorts of comments.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">In deliberating on that, as I say, I thought it was important to run past them the provisions of this bill: do they feel that this country should continue to regulate what people say to the extent that the current provisions of section 18C of the Racial Discrimination Act do? Because my extended in-laws—and there are now many of them in Australia—have been through more than I and many others in this chamber have ever been through, I valued their opinion, just as I value the opinions of those who have come into my office and made their views known, or at least sent me an email or made a phone call. But my in-laws, who have faced racism, slurs and derogatory language and who lived in a communist country where there were restrictions on things that you said and did, support the changes that we are putting up here. They have followed this debate with interest, probably because their son-in-law is a member of the Australian parliament but also because they take an interest in public life, and they support the changes. I take on board what they have to say. As they have been the subject of racial slurs, I think it is important to hear from them what they had to say. I was heartened by what they had to say. The other point they made to me when I consulted with them was that perpetuating these restrictions, the restrictions they left in their home country of Albania, is something they did not want to see.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">On that point, it was concerning to read in <span style="font-style:italic;">The Australian</span> today about the proposal from the opposition to potentially extend the scope of 18C to religion now. According to an article by Chris Merritt in today's <span style="font-style:italic;">Australian</span>, the opposition said:</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">… there was scope to reassess extending section 18C because the debate over racism had extended to religion.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I have grave concerns, and I hope sincerely that it is not the case that they plan to not only try to prevent the government's legislation from passing through this place but extend these restrictions on free speech to make us even more of a nanny state. I think that would be the worst outcome for this country.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We do not need to be wary of the citizens of this country. We do not need to take the nanny state approach and constrain personal expression here. Contrary views can sometimes be confronting, as we know in this place, and can challenge the opinions we hold strongly. As I say, they can make us uncomfortable and can be a cause for us to revisit our strongly held views and rethink what we might believe is right. But that in this country, I believe, is a normal part of discourse in our society which we should stand to protect and uphold.</span>

                      <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Senator MOORE</span>
                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Queensland</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">13:11</span>):  In this particular process, I think it is important that we consider what has gone on in our community over the last 45 years, with people engaging in this process. I take the point that Senator Duniam made that people are not talking about these issues everywhere, but what we found in the Parliamentary Joint Committee on Human Rights' extensive committee hearings over the new year period was that people who really care about this process are talking about it. Something that became very clear was that there would never be absolute agreement, and that has been reinforced by that committee and also by the recent Legal and Constitutional Affairs Committee hearings: we will not achieve agreement on this issue. What we have achieved is a wider discussion.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I have said before in this place that I think the process of the joint standing committee was truncated and rushed way too quickly. An issue had been raised about how the Racial Discrimination Act operated. Instead of taking a long-term, wider consideration of the process, the government tried to rush it. I question to this day why it was so necessary to have this particular process over the new year period, the end of January and early February, when community organisations were unable to have the time to really consider what the government was putting forward to the community. This issue had been raised a couple of years beforehand, there had been some community discussion and it was taken off the agenda. In fact, we were told by the government that it was no longer part of the current process to go forward with that. That was in 2014, I believe. But there was this rush to have a committee process, which can be, as you and I agree, Mr Acting Deputy President, the most valuable way for the Senate to work. The committee process is our link to the wider community. So to set up the joint standing committee process and then, I think, to have unseemly haste in the opportunity to talk with people was a disappointment to me.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">But, even allowing for that, we had the most valuable interaction with organisations, legal professionals and people in the wider community who cared about the Racial Discrimination Act. Most importantly to me, there were people who were personally impacted by racial discrimination. Some of the most confronting evidence we had in every state was from people from different ethnic backgrounds who had actually been the subject of racial discrimination. Some were Aboriginal and Islander brothers and sisters, in my state of Queensland and in the Northern Territory, where we had gut-wrenching evidence about what it meant to face daily discrimination. We also had it from a range of different people who have different backgrounds but talked about the hope and the feeling that Australia would provide a welcoming and safe place for them and how they coped with the range of racial comments and racial behaviours that were, in fact, damaging and harmful.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Did all of those people use the Racial Discrimination Act? No, they did not, but most of them knew it was there. In terms of the reinforcement and the security that this act has provided, it is absolutely essential that the message is given clearly to our whole community that we understand the dangers of racial discrimination and that the parliament, the government and the society of Australia understand that and will put in place processes that will protect people's personal safety and their emotional security.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Given that, the changes that we have now seen recommended by the very short Legal and Constitutional Affairs Legislation Committee inquiry have been surprising. Those of us who were involved in the joint standing committee process understand that whilst there were clear areas of agreement—which is clearly on the record in <span style="font-style:italic;">Hansard</span> and in our tabled report—there were a range of issues about which there was no agreement in the committee. That was put on record in what we call recommendation 3, which said that these issues were not agreed and that there were individuals or groups of people in the committee who had these views, and we listed them. However, in no way could that be seen as an endorsement of every issue listed.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">When the Legal and Constitutional Affairs Legislation Committee was again convened extraordinarily quickly—in fact, I have rarely seen the Senate act so quickly. It is amazing how fast this place can operate sometimes. It is not often, but when they really want to do it they can move. We had this legal and constitutional affairs committee put in place so quickly on the basis of the joint standing committee. It was actually said in the Legal and Constitutional Affairs Committee that, as these things had been in the joint standing committee, we were moving quickly—very quickly—to impose a new regime. In that new regime, it looked particularly at those magic words about humiliation and at the way that people can feel when their race is a reason for abuse, isolation or damage. We saw those magic words, and the core recommendation that has come to this parliament, in this very quickly drafted legislation, is that we remove those words and we replace them with others.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Also, in the other schedule there are a whole range of administrative changes, most of which the joint standing committee agreed on and most of which people in this place and in the wider community agreed on. But, to my disappointment, once again the government have selectively chosen what they will bring forward out of a committee report to legislation in this place.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The joint standing committee worked extremely hard to come up with a range of administrative changes that we think responded to the evidence not only of the Human Rights Commission itself but from people who had dealt with the Human Rights Commission and from people in the wider community who understood how the process should operate. But did the committee, did the parliament and did the government pick up all of the recommendations? No. They had to throw in a few things that were not even on the record during that period of consultation in January and February. That is what worries me. It is again raising expectations, raising the issues and then selectively coming forward with ideas, with recommendations, with which there is not agreement. While, as I said when I started, we will never get full agreement, it probably would be judicious to consider, when moving on such a sensitive piece of legislation, trying to get as much agreement as we can.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">As everybody knows, and I will not go over the same information, we reject the change to 'harassment' in the definition of discrimination that has been put forward in this report. We think the words that are in in place—we think the understanding that can be better in place—are already available for the community. We have judicial precedent which points out how the act will work. We have a process now where we believe the various responsibilities of discrimination concerns and aspects of free speech are effectively balanced in this legislation.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">In terms of the administrative reforms, the dissenting report is quite clear on the areas which were on record during the legal and constitutional affairs committee which we do not believe effectively fulfil the concerns about administration. There are a number of key issues there which have been covered by other speakers, which I will not go into.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I just want to add something about the process. This is a debate, and I never shy away from having debate and discussion both in this place and in the wider community, but I truly believe there has been a noxious environment created around this issue. The debate has been impacted by various statements by media and by conflicting statements put out there, which has led to more confusion in the community—and in fact not only confusion but fear, distrust and, in some cases, anger.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I am saddened that, if we are genuinely going to look at legislation, if we are genuinely going to gather together people who care about an issue and have them have the respect and the trust to exchange issues, this has not been a good process, because people in the community have been given mixed messages. I think that, no matter what happens out of this debate, the issues around the racial discrimination legislation will continue to hound and confuse.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">One of the elements that were not picked up by the legal and constitutional affairs committee was a jointly agreed recommendation that talked about the need for more education programs and for more interaction between the commission and the wider community so that there would be clear understanding about what is in the legislation and how it would operate and to remind the community that this system was not put in place as a judicial system; this system was put in place as a mediation and conciliation system. It was a very clear process. In the racial discrimination process, the idea was that, when there was concern or feelings of hurt, people would have the opportunity to come together and to work together to come up with an agreement. This was offered and continues to be offered around issues of an apology and acknowledgement. That was the intent of the system. What we should be doing in this place, with the support of the community and with the support of the commission, is to remind the community that that was the intent. It was not set up to be judicial; it was set up for mediation, and that I think is something we have lost.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Whatever happens in this debate, we need to ensure that there is that community discussion and an awareness and education program and that people can have genuine trust that one thing that should bind us together is a rejection of any element of racial discrimination. That should be the answer that we come up with in this parliament.</span>

                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">
                    <a href="G0D" type="MemberSpeech">
                      <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Senator BERNARDI</span>
                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">South Australia</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">13:22</span>):  I do not mind standing here and saying unashamedly that I am a freedom lover. I believe that there should be less government. I believe there should be lower taxes. I think there should be more self-reliance by every member of our community, that we should have freedom of thought, freedom of worship and freedom of action. But action, of course, has consequences. That is why we have the rule of law. But some laws are just plain wrong, because when they were considered no-one anticipated how they would be misused and abused to corrupt the original intention. Section 18C of the Racial Discrimination Act is one of those examples. In fact, it is the quintessential example of bad law, of law that, no matter how well intentioned when it was formed and brought in, has been misused because it is subjective and it is oppressive and because the process attached to investigating it is absolutely rotten to the core. So I support the government's changes contained in the Human Rights Legislation Amendment Bill 2017. Belatedly, the government has been dragged—kicking and screaming, I should say—to dealing with the misuse of section 18C of the Racial Discrimination Act.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The key offence of section 18C is that it creates an offence for insulting or offending someone else. It means that the complainant does not even have to be insulted or offended for themselves. They can take insult and offence on behalf someone else. That is simply preposterous. It is akin to me saying, 'I am sorry, I am going to lodge a complaint and drag someone through a tribunal, court or legal process because I think you might be offended by what someone else has had to say.' I regret to say that I could not do that through section 18C of the Racial Discrimination Act, because apparently it only applies to some races. It does not apply to everyone, because we have had Senator Leyonhjelm lodge a complaint about being called an angry white man, but that was dismissed. I can only imagine if, instead of white, there was another colour used or if it was about a woman that would find its way into the complaints tribunal. I do not have any doubt about that. Even the process attached to these complaints—spurious complaints and subjective complaints—is rotten, because it only applies to certain people in our community. That much is very, very clear.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We have to ask ourselves how we can justify the misuse of section 18C of the Racial Discrimination Act, which has been applied in such a blunt and unjust fashion in recent times. I have heard no-one in this place or out in the broader community who is able to justify its misuse in the case of the students from the Queensland university. No-one can justify it, because it is rotten to the core. We had a circumstance where some students walked into an unoccupied computer lab in a Queensland university. They were told to go, because their skin colour and ethnicity were wrong. They then went onto Facebook, where one wrote, 'Fighting segregation with segregation.' Someone else said something along the lines of 'where's the white supremacists' lab?' They may be comments that people do not like, but the person who kicked them out decided to this was a path to profit and lodged a complaint saying they felt insulted and defended, and seeking $250,000 worth of compensation for booting some white kids out of an Indigenous lab. That is an injustice, and the fact that it was entertained by those people in the Human Rights Commission for many years—they did not even tell the people who were the subject of this complaint for about 14 months—is an indictment of the process. It is an indictment of Professor Triggs and her comrades in the Human Rights Commission, who have done an unbelievable disservice to people in this country. And still they appear at Senate estimates doing the Pontius Pilate: washing their hands of it and saying, 'We've done nothing wrong.' They have done a heck of a lot wrong. They have done an unbelievable disservice. The simple fact that these students, the ones who did not pay to Ms Prior the $5,000 compensation which was her price for go-away money, had to engage lawyers and fight this fight and battle for three years and had to go to court to have it dismissed. Those on the other side of this chamber say, 'That proves the process works.' Clearly, they have never had to fund their own court defence. Clearly they have never been dragged through the courts, have never had to enter into mediation and engage lawyers on such spurious actions. It is debilitating. It can destroy people's confidence. In the case of one of these Queensland university students it destroyed his desirable career, because he thought he would be forever labelled a racist.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Everything that is wrong with section 18C has been demonstrated by that case. Yet those on that side of the chamber do not want to know a thing about it. They are in denial, and that is part of the problem we have in this country. We have a group of people who are using laws like section 18C, their own denial and their own compartmentalisation of politics as a method of shutting down debate, of shutting down discussion and freedom of speech, of denying freedom of choice. I lay this directly at the feet of the left side of politics, not in a partisan political manner but by saying that their desire to pursue identity politics and not to see Australians as one homogenous group but to compartmentalise them into people broken down by differences of race, religion, gender or sexuality has done our entire country an enormous disservice. They have cultivated a culture of victimhood, an ideology where there is a grievance industry perpetually looking to be outraged, to stifle others from pursuing what I think are very reasonable contributions to public debate.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">There is a problem with that, of course. Those on the left side of politics should be very careful because, whenever you are feeding the crocodile all the things you do not like, eventually you run out of them, and the crocodile of political correctness and victimhood ideology will ultimately consume you too. Within that culture of leftism, where they are identifying victims, there is always going to be a hierarchy of victimhood, and, as I said in my maiden speech in this place, we are going to be forced to choose whose rights trump other people's rights, which rights should prevail. That is exactly what we have got happening here. The culture of victimhood is about some rights subjugating others, and it is doing a disservice to our entire community.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Section 18C clearly needs reform. I have sponsored two bills in this place that were very simple bills to remove the two words 'insult' and 'offend' from the section so that there is less subjectivity. But the government's bill in some ways goes even further, in the sense that it also reforms the process attached to investigating complaints. I think that is a very worthy step forward, but there are also some problems with the government's approach, which I will be seeking to amend during the committee stage. We need to stop section 18C effectively being a 'hurt feelings' test. We need to stop it from being used, or misused, to bludgeon legitimate debate into submission. We need to change it to stop it being used as a method of profiteering by some sensitive snowflakes who claim, whether correctly or not, that they have been upset or offended or insulted by something someone else has to say.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">These changes are necessary because of the evidence of the misuse of section 18C in recent years, not only in relation to the Queensland University of Technology students but also in the case of the late cartoonist Bill Leak being taken to the tribunal and having to defend himself. And we had one of the human rights commissioners touting for business, seeking complaints on behalf of the grievance industry. We rightly outlaw touts on the racetrack. I do not think they should be able to tout for the discrimination industry either. That hangs around Mr Soutphommasane's neck. It is a yoke that he will have to wear. He may defend it all he likes, but it is absolutely wrong. So the procedural changes have my support absolutely. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The bill goes even further than I wanted to in respect of the removal of 'insult' and 'offend'. It also wants to take 'humiliate' out and replace it with the word 'harass'. I understand the intentions of the government in this space, and I will support it, but I would like an amendment about the definition of 'harass'. According to the government's definition and some of the things it is putting forward, 'harass' can mean a single instance of a social media post or something like that. I understand that sometimes politicians move in a parallel universe, but I went through a number of international dictionaries, and 'harass' has a slightly different meaning than the one the government is inserting into this bill. It is all about repeated actions. The definition of 'harass' in the United States is: repeatedly making small-scale attacks on an enemy. 'Repeatedly' is the key word there. It is not a single instance, which is where the government has got this wrong. That definition goes on through any other dictionary that is there. It is all about continually or repeatedly having an action take place. So this bill needs to be amended—and I will be seeking to do so in the committee stage—to redefine 'harass' so that the fact that someone has put up an unpleasant Facebook post or said something on a single instance will not constitute harassment. This would bring it much more closely into alignment with a legal definition of harassment, rather than a political definition of harassment.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The second amendment that I will be seeking to introduce is what I am describing as the 'truth is a defence' clause. At the moment, the truth of a statement is not actually considered by the Human Rights Commission, even in the amendments to the process that have been put forward by the government, and nor is it actually part of this act or the Racial Discrimination Act itself in terms of the consideration by those who are rendering judgement in a legal sense. I think we need to have an amendment—which I will be proposing later—that says that section 18C does not render unlawful an act if the person who does the act proves that the act carries an imputation that is substantially true. This will enable someone charged or being investigated under this act to say, 'What I said was substantially true; these things took place; these are the facts surrounding it,' and so the ordeal of the process can be dismissed almost immediately by the proving of those facts, or, if the Human Rights Commission continues to be biased and twisted and seemingly committed to perpetuating the grievance and victimhood ideology, when it gets to a court, a judge can go, 'Thank you; we accept the truth of this defence.'</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I think they are very sensible changes, and I hope the government will consider them, because in the end our responsibility is to ensure that our legal system and the framework that we are imposing upon people act in the best interests of our nation.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I close by saying that the reform to section 18C does not give people licence to go out there and egregiously cause offence. It is not designed to allow hate speech, as those on the other side want to characterise it. There are so many times it has been misused by those who are prepared to attack freedom of speech, by making things up, that the whole debate—I have to agree with Senator Moore—has become a bit toxic around this issue because of the alt-Left ideology that is out there and the fake news that they are putting forward. The simple fact is that, until recent times, section 18C was rarely, if ever, used, but now it is being used as a weapon of mass destruction in the battle for freedom in this country.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Nonetheless, the issue is that section 18C has been misused in recent times. I am yet to hear anyone in this place defend its misuse against the Queensland University of Technology students, and, if you cannot defend the use of a law, it is time to amend it. That is why I support the government's amendments to section 18C. I hope my amendments will be successful, but, if they are not successful, I will still support the Human Rights Legislation Amendment Bill 2017; and, if the bill is not successful, I look forward to having a debate about simply removing 'insult' and 'offend' from section 18C, as per the bill that I have introduced into the Senate on two occasions. Thank you.</span>

                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">
                    <a href="YW4" type="MemberSpeech">
                      <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Senator IAN MACDONALD</span>
                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Queensland</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">13:40</span>):  I want to contribute a few words to this debate on the Human Rights Legislation Amendment Bill 2017, mainly in my role as Chair of the Legal and Constitutional Affairs Legislation Committee, which inquired into this piece of legislation on behalf of the Senate. This, of course, is not a new issue. It is not a new proposal even. I remind those who might be listening that the coalition went to the 2013 election with a commitment to either abolish or substantially review section 18C of the Racial Discrimination Act. Senators may recall that 18C became almost a household word following the prosecution of a columnist, Mr Andrew Bolt, under section 18C of the act in 2011. At the time, the then Prime Minister said that it was the coalition's view that freedom of speech is very, very important, and it was important to ensure that we did not have racism in this country. Mr Abbott said, on behalf of most coalition parliamentarians at the time, I think, that we believed that Mr Bolt should not have been prosecuted under that section. So this issue has been around for a long time, but particularly since it hit the headlines at the time of 'Boltgate'.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Following the 2013 election, the coalition did indicate that there would be legislation introduced into the parliament that year to ensure that the Human Rights Commission carried out the role that it was designed for. It was the view of the government then that the commission was being too narrow and selective in its view on human rights. At the time, the government said that it was going to enact some structural reform that the commission president herself had been for looking for.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">My only regret is that it has taken this long to get to a review of section 18C. I pause to think what would have happened had the government pursued its intentions back in 2014, rather than delaying till now. Perhaps Mr Leak's untimely death might not have occurred. Perhaps the university students who were dragged through an intolerable couple of years of their lives might not have been in that predicament, had the government moved on that review following the 2013 election, as we had indicated at the time. I understand the reasons for that, but there was clearly building, within the Australian community, an understanding that 18C could not stand, because of the way it had been interpreted in the past. This was reinforced by the QUT students case, the facts of which Senator Bernardi has just mentioned and which I will not repeat. But to most fair-minded, ordinary, average Australians—the reasonable Australian—that was an outrageous abuse of power by the Human Rights Commission, and it drew attention to the need for reform.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">It was such that, as Senator Bernardi said, he introduced a bill that was co-sponsored by—from memory—12 or so other senators, of which I was proudly one, to remove the words 'insult' and 'offend' from section 18C of the Racial Discrimination Act. That was, as I recall, a bill that had the support of a number of government senators and a number of the crossbenchers. I am fairly confident that I can say Senator Leyonhjelm was one, and I suspect Senator Hinch might have been one of those who co-sponsored that bill as well. It was really the outrageous application of 18C in the QUT case that caused that coming together of minds that saw the need to change.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">One of the most outrageous actions of the Human Rights Commission in the QUT case was, of course, that a number of young students were accused of racial vilification in what I think most Australians would think was a fairly simple comment—again, Senator Bernardi has given the details of that—but these students were not even told about it for some 18 months. That defeats one of the basic principles of natural justice: if you are accused of something, you must at least be told about it and must be given the right to mount your defence. In the case of these young students, they were not even told about it. So, for 18 months, they lived their lives unaware that they could be dragged before the Human Rights Commission and, worse, they could end up as respondents in a lawsuit for $250,000, which none of them, as law students, would have had.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">In fact, one student, when he did first learn about this, was so petrified at the prospect of having to pay $250,000 in damages plus legal costs that he took the easy way out—and I do not blame him—and paid $5,000 go-away money, just so the complainant would not proceed in a legal suit against him. The others, fortuitously, decided to fight it, and in that they were assisted by one of Australia's best senior counsels, Mr Tony Morris, who, as I understand it—I am not privy to this, of course, but I understand from news reports—did the work for free. All congratulations go to Mr Morris for standing up for the right of freedom of speech by helping these young people.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The Human Rights Commission, I repeat, for 18 months did not even tell the people being accused that they had been accused. In that intervening period, the tracking of some of the evidence that may have been available about emails that had passed from one party to another party to another party had been lost. Of course, when the subsequent civil lawsuit got to the courts—these are my words, not the judge's—the case was laughed out of court. I understand that costs are being awarded against the complainant—unlikely, though, ever to be paid. That is the background to this whole sorry saga. The QUT case particularly galvanised public support for the move to have some review, some redress, some amendment and some further consideration of 18C.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">And then we all know, because it was in relatively recent times, the Bill Leak cartoon—a very graphic cartoon, a very telling cartoon, not a racist cartoon at all. No-one could suggest that that was racist except the Human Rights Commission. One of the commissioners—although he denies it and has done so at a couple of the committees that I have presided over—it is clear, was letting people know that if they were offended they should contact him or contact the Human Rights Commission. If they did, he then made the point, rightly, that he was not the one who determined it, but his colleague the President of the Human Rights Commission would become judge and jury of a complaint which one of the commissioners at best advertised and at worst encouraged to be made. No matter where you are in Australia—other parts of the world might be different—no-one could consider that that was fair and proper practice.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Hence, the government, somewhat belatedly, but better late than never, some might say—although I am not sure that Mr Leak's family would say that—has brought forward legislation to address this particular section. But it did not do it overnight. The government set up an all-party joint committee of the parliament that deliberated—I think—for over two months, had a number of meetings, assessed the evidence, read all of the submissions, discussed what the committee's conclusion should be and came forward with a very good report under the chairmanship of Mr Goodenough MP. The committee decided to take the view that there were several ways that this could be addressed and gave the government—because they were reporting to government—the option of several ways to address this. They also made some very sound and strong recommendations as to the process that should be followed, some of which, I have to say, Professor Triggs had spoken about in one of the estimates committees before which she appeared. And so the government considered that report that had been carefully put together by members of that committee and came forward with a piece of legislation which was then referred, as I said earlier, to the Legal and Constitutional Affairs Legislation Committee, which I chair, for a brief look at that particular bill being proposed by the government.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">It was not a terribly complicated piece of legislation from the government. It had been, as I said, spoken about for almost four or five years. Everybody had argued it back and forward. The joint committee had looked at it over a couple of months or more. And so the Senate referred the bill, when it came to this chamber, to my committee to have a quick look to see whether it was an appropriate bill and one that should be supported by the parliament.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The committee did call submissions quite quickly. We were not really interested in the substantive issue of 18C, because another committee of this parliament had already spent two months going through that in very fine detail. We wanted to look at some of the actual provisions of the bill and to see if there were suggestions that could be made to improve the bill, understanding that it was the government's intention and the government's prerogative to bring a bill forward as the government saw fit. The committee did take evidence over the course of last Friday morning and had a number of written submissions, and we relied heavily on the hundreds of pages of <span style="font-style:italic;">Hansard </span>evidence given in the other parliamentary committee that had looked at this very carefully.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I should mention in passing that there was some complaint that not everybody who wanted to appear before the committee was able to appear. The Institute of Public Affairs was one of those. They wanted to come and appear, but the committee said, 'No, we've selected a narrow group of people to address the important issues, and that's what we're going to do.' We had the Human Rights Law Centre or the Multicultural Legal Centre—I have got it somewhere here in my notes—and they wanted to bring along an Indigenous group. The Labor Party made some big issue about that. These groups had all had the opportunity to put their point to the other committee, and my committee came to the conclusion that, if you invite groups of people knowing that there are different groups of those people who have one view and others that have another view, you start repeating what the previous committee had done. So we decided to restrict it.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The committee found that the bill would make overdue reforms to the Racial Discrimination Act, strengthening the protections against hateful speech based on race, colour or national or ethnic origin on one hand and at the same time enhancing the rights of freedom of speech that all Australians enjoy.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">In its consideration the committee noted that the term 'harass' had been recommended by the joint committee that had dealt with this committee for some time. The committee thought that using the term 'harass' was an appropriate broadening of the scope of the section in a way which did not impinge upon legitimate freedom of speech. The committee went on to say that some of the recommendations of the joint committee report included many that were instigated at the request of the commission itself to improve administrative function and government, but the committee in its wisdom also thought that the government should consider some amendments to this bill before us today. Whilst we did not actually recommend the amendments, we did suggest that the government should contemplate that the bill should be extended to existing as well as new complaints. Existing complaints that were in the system, the committee thought, should probably be covered by this amending bill, and we have asked the government in our report to have a look at that and to see whether they think the government might be able to amend it accordingly.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We also considered that it was worthwhile drawing the attention of the government and the parliament to a particular issue for consideration, and that was to improve the future interpretation of some of the bill's provisions. In the public hearing some witnesses argued that the term 'harassment' was not sufficiently defined in the explanatory memorandum. Given that the term was central to the amendments made by the bill, the committee considered that the government could consider explaining this term more fully so as to give direction to interpretation into the future. That is the matter which Senator Bernardi also mentioned in his contribution, and I believe Senator Bernardi intends to move some amendments towards that. We will hear those debated later on, but, for the moment, the committee has asked the government to have a look at that and see whether a comment in the explanatory memorandum could be made that would better define 'harassment' and 'harass'. Senators will know that the explanatory memorandum and the second reading speech can well be used by the courts later on as an aid to interpretation, and that is why the committee thought that a neater way of dealing with it rather than through Senator Bernardi's legislative proposal might be for the government to mention this in some amended explanatory memorandum or in a second reading speech.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">With those couple possibilities, the committee which investigated this bill quite fully was very keen in its recommendation that the bill should be passed, and I urge the Senate to follow the committee's recommendation.</span>

I have not yet had the opportunity to review the <span style="font-style:italic;">Hansard</span>, but I did want to address one matter relating to the withdrawal of remarks which are contrary to the standing orders. If the chair requires remarks to be withdrawn, that withdrawal must be unconditional. In withdrawing such remarks, a senator must not repeat them. This is a standard that has been consistently applied in this place for many years. By repeating remarks judged by the chair to be unparliamentarily, a senator is, in effect, disregarding the authority of the chair, contrary to the standing orders. If there are any other matters on which I need to come back to the Senate, I will do so after reviewing the <span style="font-style:italic;">Hansard</span>.</span>

It has never been the practice of Australian governments, either coalition or Labor, to propose a particular figure in the national minimum wage case. What the government asks the commission to do is to have regard to the overall economic circumstances and the likely impact on the economy of any particular increase in the minimum wage. More commonly than not, governments of both sides, like the Rudd and Gillard governments and the current government, have urged caution or restraint in imposing burdens on business, as your side of politics did when it was you making submissions as a government on the minimum wage. We certainly do not, however, support the $45 a week increase the ACTU has called for, because that would be irresponsible.</span>

In asking my question to the minister, I wonder if the Senate would allow me the indulgence of expressing the Senate's and the parliament's solidarity with those who have lost property and homes in the cyclone, and also acknowledging the volunteers and civilians who have done so much to help before, during and after the cyclone hit the coast. My question to the minister relates to the work that I know the ADF is doing. As I drove up to Townsville to come to Canberra yesterday, I passed convoys of Army trucks moving south towards the cyclone area. I ask the minister if she could indicate to the Senate how the Australian Defence Force has supported the people of North Queensland affected by the cyclone?</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">The Prime Minister and the opposition leader visited some of the worst affected areas this morning. More than 1,200 ADF personnel are assisting with the recovery efforts in North Queensland. The ADF is working very closely with the Queensland government and a range of state and federal agencies as part of a comprehensive, whole-of-government response.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">We have ongoing heavy rain and damaging wind gusts, which are affecting the efforts both to assess the damage from the cyclone and to begin the recovery process of affected communities between Ayr and Mackay. However, yesterday, two King Air aircraft completed wide area surveillance of potentially affected areas. As we have seen from the images online and further afield over the past two days, the damage to property in some areas is severe. Rotary-wing aircraft reconnaissance produced over 150 images for the Queensland Reconstruction Authority, while our MRH90 helicopter transported 10 necessary medical staff to Proserpine. HMAS <span style="font-style:italic;">Melville</span>, which is one of the Navy's hydrographic survey vessels, has completed port survey and rapid environment assessment of Abbot Point. </span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">It is also important, I think, to acknowledge that the recovery work is in its early stages and the ADF is preparing itself for further requests for assistance. Those requests will of course be made in conjunction with the Queensland authorities and the other relevant federal authorities such as Emergency Management Australia. Defence continues in its efforts to pre-position resources from which ADF support can be provided in the affected areas, including those very remote centres.</span>

But Senator Macdonald is correct; as we have seen, the Whitsundays is one of the hardest hit areas. Yesterday, HMAS <span style="font-style:italic;">Choules</span> loaded stores and engineering equipment in Brisbane to establish three disaster response sites in the Whitsunday Group. <span style="font-style:italic;">Choules</span> has an MRH90 helicopter embarked as well as medical personnel, and both the helicopter and the ship's landing craft will be used to take supplies directly onto the islands as she left from Brisbane yesterday afternoon. An Army amphibious landing craft is also transporting an amphibious beach team to the Whitsunday Islands to conduct survey operations and inspect damage.

ADF members from Navy, Army and Air Force are helping with the evacuations; with aeromedical transport; with search and rescue; with assistance to restore critical infrastructure; with the road and route clearance—as the weather allows; with emergency food, water, fuel and shelter delivery and distribution; as well as with those reconnaissance surveillance and damage assessments I have mentioned.</span>

As the picture on the ground becomes clearer, the ADF will begin to move out into the affected communities. It is a great effort from the ADF and the men and women who are working in the 1,200-strong joint task force. It illustrates the importance, I think of the pre-deployment of assets and personnel to ensure that assistance could flow immediately. The ADF is well experienced in such operations. <span style="font-style:italic;">(Time expired)</span></span>

In relation to the first part of his question, I completely reject what he has stated, that the government has filed a submission that does not support an increase in the minimum wage. In relation to the very selective quote that appeared on the front page of a Fairfax newspaper this morning, can I confirm that this is similar information that is provided each year by the government of the day, regardless of who is in power.

In relation to the annual wage review, obviously it looks at low paid and those who are on the national minimum wage regardless of gender. In relation to the actual impact on women, however, one of the points that the submission does make in relation to the gender pay gap is that because women are more likely to be on awards or on the minimum wage than men there is less likely to be a gender pay gap because they are normally paid the equivalent rate as the person they are working next to if they are a man. The point that the submission makes is if you want to look at a gender pay gap, you actually have to look further up to higher paid people.</span>

That is not the government's advice. As I said, in relation to the very selective quote that was made, that was provided by government, regardless of who was in power, in 2011, 2012 and 2013. The former Labor government provided very similar information. Senator Cameron, based on your history in relation to industrial relations, you would know that governments, in relation to the annual wage review, provide contemporary economic data to the Fair Work Commission that the Fair Work Commission is then able to take into account when determining whether or not there should be an increase in the minimum wage. The one being we do not shy away from—and it is something that Bill Shorten did not shy away from when he was the relevant minister—is that you also need to take into account—</span>

This week we saw the Turnbull government's attempt, via Deputy Prime Minister Joyce, to interfere in forest issues in Victoria and push for the release of more timber to the Heyfield mill. It is timber that simply is not there, because current native forest log supply volumes are commercially unviable, and Victorian government estimates show that the rate of logging that the mill is requesting would mean that the forest could be logged out in just a few years. Given that there is no long-term future in native forest logging, when will this government stop presiding over the inevitable collapse in jobs and in the critically endangered mountain ash ecosystem and actually plan for a transition to long-term security through sustainable plantations for Australia's timber and wood fibre needs?</span>

When the Victorian government came to power they reduced the amount of area that Australian Sustainable Hardwoods could log from 155,000 cubic metres to 80,000 cubic metres. I am advised that they have further reduced that to 60,000 cubic metres for the next two years. That is what has put pressure on Australian Sustainable Hardwoods and put at risk these 260 jobs.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">This week, the Deputy Prime Minister wrote to the Premier of Victoria asking him to work with the government on ways we could provide more forestry area to keep the mill open, to keep these jobs alive and to allow these people to continue to provide for their families in an environmentally sustainable way. The Deputy Prime Minister has suggested that some of the future years' logging areas could be brought forward so that we can at least help provide for production now. He has also suggested that we should look at elements of the informal reserve system on production forest land, which could be swapped for the many thousands of hectares of new buffer zone exclusions around colonies that have been introduced since—</span>

History tells us that we have been smart enough to eventually recognise when destructive industries like sealing and whaling have no future. When will this government wake up and see that trashing our native forests should, like those pursuits, be consigned to the dustbin of history?</span>

I am advised that no old-growth forests are logged for the Heyfield mill. It has always been the case that as soon as the Greens achieve one objective, like old-growth forests, they then go to the next one, saying, 'We can't have plantation forests.' Apparently, we can import all our timber from overseas—which is what we largely do at the moment—but we are not allowed to touch our own forests as well. I think we have a responsibility to sustainably harvest our forests so as to provide jobs and also to provide the goods and services that we all rely on in the modern economy that the Greens use. We can do that because we do not use old-growth forests in this region. I am also advised that the biggest threat to the Leadbeater's possum and possums in the region is bushfires, not the forestry industry, and responsible logging can help deal with that issue as well. Senator Rice, you need to have a more balanced approach to this whole issue than your ideological objective of putting people out of work.</span>

We can have a sustainable tourism industry in this country. We can have a sustainable manufacturing industry in this country. We can have lots of different things in this country and manage them sensibly so that we can have a diverse range of jobs for Australian people. That has been proven in many areas, and I think we do a much better job of managing our own environment and our own forests than do many countries around the world. We should be proud of that and, indeed, we should be using those principles and practices to supply the products and services we need. Australians are not going to consume less furniture or less wood. What they will do is bring them in from other countries that do not necessarily share our practice. So the Greens want to export all the problems to other parts of the world because they view that it is out of sight and out of mind and we do not have to deal with it. We prefer to do the hard job of sustainably dealing with these issues and protecting jobs at the same time.</span>

Absolutely, we stand by that statement. That statement actually has the support of many Indigenous groups who now understand that having a target affects nothing, because we have none of the levers. Having a Bex and a good lie down might be politically correct. It might be the easy thing to do, but it is not the right thing to do. The Commonwealth are determined to do the right thing: through COAG, have an agreement across the states and territories. They have the levers. They own the criminal justice system, they own the court system and they own the correctional system, so they can do things and they can have targets to set those matters to rest.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">What we have done is say, 'We can do some other things, though. Yes, that's a matter for the states and they can set their targets.' So we looked carefully at the data and we realised that 82 per cent of Aboriginals who are currently incarcerated have, in fact, been there before. They are recidivist offenders. We have looked very carefully at that demographic. The first day that you are incarcerated, all our energy is on ensuring that everything that happens to you during that incarceration period ensures that you do not come back again. This is a strategy that is a thoughtful strategy. It has the support of very many justice groups around Australia, which I speak to very frequently. The advice on that area has certainly been provided to me by many Indigenous organisations. It is a more sophisticated approach than in the past. The state and territory jurisdictions are the ones who control the levers, so they should have the targets with respect to those levers. It is my responsibility as well to ensure that we hold them to account for those targets, so in a separate area the Commonwealth is dealing with the states to ensure that the 82 per cent recidivism is reduced. That is the particular area that we are working on.</span>

The report was actually referring to state targets. They were not Commonwealth targets. Our recommendation, through COAG, is to ensure that the justice targets are consistent targets that are adopted by all the jurisdictions. It has to be a consistent target based on best practice. We have said that there will be a suite of activities in this area and that justice targets should be a part of Australia's approach to it. The justice targets are a part of the responsibilities of states and territories, and we will be taking our responsibilities in another way.</span>

Right at the moment, Territorians on that poll have voted 60 per cent in favour of myself and condone my view. That is almost two Senate quotas, Senator.</span>

The government, of course, is taking action when others are proposing that we should have yet another inquiry in the form of a banking royal commission. What the government has done is boosted the resources of ASIC; boosted the powers of ASIC. We forced the bank CEOs to appear on a regular basis in front of a relevant parliamentary committee to be accountable to the public in relation to their performance. You mentioned a series of reviews that have been taking place in recent times. This of course builds on the very substantial financial systems inquiry which this government conducted, which also identified a whole series of necessary improvements. It builds on work that was done all the way back by Senator Bushby as chair of the banking inquiry a few years back. Over the last few years, Senator Hanson, this parliament, through its committees, has identified a whole range of improvements, both in terms of financial system regulation and in terms of the powers and the resources that need to be available to ASIC in particular. The government has acted and responded to those recommendations as appropriate. We are always open to talking about how further improvements can be made, but we do not believe that the right way forward is yet another inquiry.</span>

Obviously, whenever you are presented with recommendations, as a government, you consider the recommendations that have been made and how best to achieve the best possible outcome, and that is what the government is doing. We believe that the financial system regulation is in much better shape today as a result of the decisions that this government has made. We believe that ASIC is much better resourced now and has much more appropriate powers to deal with the sorts of issues that Senator Hanson raised.</span>

The banks, and indeed the financial services sector as a whole, are very heavily regulated and very heavily subject to Commonwealth regulation, which is, of course, entirely appropriate. That regulation is enforced by a series of regulatory bodies, not least of which is the Reserve Bank, not least of which is the Australian Prudential Regulation Authority and not least of which is ASIC, which you have mentioned. There is a very high level of regulation when it comes to the banking system here in Australia. That is appropriate. It is always also appropriate for us as policymakers to reflect on how that regulation can be further improved. That is a process that has been ongoing and will continue to be ongoing in the future.</span>

Senator Bushby, of course, is perhaps one of the best qualified to ask a question on this topic. As, I suspect, the only graduate of a maritime college in this federal parliament, Senator Bushby indeed understands some of these training issues and the opportunities better than almost anybody.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The Turnbull government is very proud to be pursuing Australia's largest ever defence capability investment. As Senator Payne has touched on many times in this chamber, these are significant groundbreaking, changing investments: the $3 billion Offshore Patrol Vessel, the $35 billion Future Frigate Program, the $50 billion SEA1000 Future Submarine Program. All of them, of course, will dramatically enhance our future defence capability, most importantly, but they will also drive defence industry development around Australia and, through that, the creation of many thousands of jobs—an estimated 5,200 jobs over the next 10 years—which will be generated across Australia as a result of these undertakings.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Most critical to the successful delivery of Defence capability and the optimisation of the defence industry potential is, of course, having a skilled workforce in place. That is why we are taking a proactive national approach to naval shipbuilding workforce development and skills. My department, along with the Department of Defence, have been engaging across the country in discussions about how best to do this, and we have announced plans for a $25 million naval shipbuilding college to help coordinate the education and training requirements across the country that will be necessary to deliver the skills that are necessary. This will be an opportunity for all states, and all educational and training institutions who have the right skills, to engage in helping to deliver the workforce that is required for success in the defence industry and to fill those more than 5,000 jobs that we are proudly creating.</span>

It will take a hub-and-spoke approach in terms of its engagement, identifying the skill needs for successful delivery of the naval shipbuilding projects and then, where necessary, potentially procuring the development of those training packages and programs to fill those needs in the future. It will be complementary to, work with and engage with existing institutions, rather than replacing any of them. The college will seek to identify, attract, train and retrain more than 1,500 people in the first few years of operation, and it will be a truly national endeavour befitting, of course, the national endeavour that is the naval shipbuilding program itself. Over 100 universities and training providers already provide particular skills in terms of naval shipbuilding and operations right around the country, including in engineering, precision welding, electrotechnology and naval architecture, and we want to leverage those existing capabilities as much as we possibly can.</span>

There are many good examples where we are able to do so. For example, the Australian Maritime College in Tasmania, where Senator Bushby studied, provides maritime engineering, naval architecture and maritime and logistics management. The government has had engagement with the University of Tasmania and the Australian Maritime College to outline how we believe they can benefit, and we will absolutely be continuing that engagement with them to make sure that they are appraised of the opportunities that our new maritime technical college program will provide. It should mean more students studying in Launceston, but it should also mean more students studying in many locations around the country. In Western Australia, the South Metropolitan TAFE already provides courses like an engineering certificate III in ship building, which will provide opportunities particularly tied to the Henderson shipyards and the work that will be undertaken there in Perth. Equally, South Australia's three public universities, TAFE SA and defence industry association are collaborating on opportunities that they see: opportunities across states, across the spectrum from the thousands of jobs we are generating. <span style="font-style:italic;">(Time expired)</span></span>

Between 2004 and 2015, government invested around $60 million in the Australian Primary Care Collaborative's program. This program developed quality indicators for many national health priorities, including diabetes and cardiovascular disease. These indicators are now available in many practice software systems including MedicalDirector. My question is: why has the government failed to include indicators from the APCC in the primary health network performance framework given the need for nationally consistent qualitative measurement?</span>

He would be aware that it was this government that established the 31 PHNs in 2015. This was to increase the efficiency and effectiveness of medical services for patients, particularly those at risk of poor health outcomes. It was also done to improve coordination of care to ensure patients received the right care in the right place at the right time. PHNs work directly with general practitioners, other primary health care providers, secondary care providers and hospitals to facilitate improved outcomes. </span>

These are mental health, Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander health, population health, health workforce, eHealth and aged care. I am advised that the Australian Primary Care Collaborative's program is used voluntarily by individual practices. The collaborative's program developed a number of quality indicators which have been adapted into continuous improvement programs for general practice, which continue to be run by the PHNs in most regions. The concept of a continuous improvement system developed out of the collaborative's is currently being adapted in discussions with general practice.</span>

That plan will outline the broad categories of measures to be collected, of which relevant clinical indicators will only be a part. The choice of indicators will be informed by an evidence based assessment of the likely impacts of the model and an analysis of systematic reviews of similar models. Consideration will be given to existing indicators in the selection of indicators for the broad categories of measures. The evaluation of health care homes will examine the effect of the model on quality of care, patient and provider experience, practice behaviour, service usage and cost impacts. It will explore how the model works in various situations and settings and a look at what works best for different patients and practice types and in different communities with varying demographics. The evaluation will also consider the implementation process.</span>

It is proposed that participation in this incentive will involve the sharing of practice data with a third party, such as PHNs, based on a small number of key indicators which will be negotiated and agreed with the sector. The work undertaken under the Primary Care Collaborative's program is likely to inform the development of these key indicators. Over time it is expected that the quality of data against these indicators will improve and thereby improve health outcomes for patients.</span>

Last Monday the ABC's <span style="font-style:italic;">7.30</span> program exposed the appalling conditions experienced by Aerocare workers at Sydney Airport. Aerocare workers are paid at a rate below the poverty line and forced to work split shifts, often spending 15 hours a day at the airport but receiving as little as seven or eight hours pay. Was the government aware of the appalling conditions facing workers at Sydney Airport before those conditions were exposed on the <span style="font-style:italic;">7.30</span> program. If yes, what action has the government taken, and if no, why have you taken no action?</span>

The government is aware of media reports about working conditions for certain workers at Sydney Airport. As Senator Gallacher has articulated, these workers are engaged under an enterprise agreement between employers and their employer, Aerocare. In other words, they have gone through the negotiating process for the agreement, and they have agreed to the agreement and it has been approved by the Fair Work Commission—it has been approved by the independent Fair Work Commission. I also understand, though, that Aero Care is currently negotiating a new enterprise agreement, and I understand that the Transport Workers Union and the Australian Services Union are themselves now seeking to cover workers in this agreement.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Any worker concerned that the terms that have been negotiated in their enterprise agreement, which has been approved by the independent Fair Work Commission, are not being followed should raise their concerns with the Fair Work Ombudsman, which can then obviously investigate the matter. I am also informed that both Aerocare and the Fair Work Ombudsman are investigating the matters that have been raised in the media reports and considering whether further action is now needed. Again I would say that they are employed under an enterprise agreement that has been agreed between the employees and the employer, but at this point in time they are in the middle of negotiating a new enterprise agreement under which two unions—the Transport Workers Union and the Australian Services Union—are seeking to cover the workers in the agreement.</span>

Again, Senator Gallacher, the point is this: they are employed under an enterprise agreement that has been negotiated between the employer and the employees. They have agreed on the terms and conditions. The enterprise agreement has been approved by the independent Fair Work Commission. If anyone has concerns in relation to whether or not those conditions are being met, they should absolutely raise them with the Fair Work Ombudsman. And as I said, I am informed that the Fair Work Ombudsman is currently investigating this matter.</span>

I am absolutely delighted to stand up in this place and update the Senate on the many significant achievements of the Turnbull-Joyce government in regional Australia. We have established the new Building Better Regions Fund, which will deliver infrastructure and community investment right across our regional communities. We are delivering a $220 million Regional Jobs and Investment Package to create jobs and prosperity in regional economies.

In health, we are delivering Australia's first ever National Rural Health Commissioner and $11 million for the Royal Flying Doctor Service. We are delivering a $300 million national ice package and $25 million for a new Dubbo cancer centre. In education we are investing $150 million for remote student access and $5 million to boost the number of Indigenous scholarships. In communications we have invested $220 million for new and upgraded mobile towers. We have expanded Sky Muster's capacity. We have expanded the fixed wireless footprint. We have prioritised the NBN rollout to regional areas, and we have $2 billion in concessional drought loans to support farm businesses. And we have $2.5 billion for national water infrastructure.

Unfortunately, some of it was general security, which you actually do not get. The first year she only got 20 per cent of the water that she bought. She then went on to spend $34 million buying water from Tandou—supplementary water that only exists in a flood.

We have delivered three major free trade treatments and are opening up new markets for Australian exporters. Labor concluded no major trade deals, shut down our live export cattle trade with Indonesia and brought our northern beef industry to its knees. We are the ones standing up for small business, bringing in an effects test, but are the Labor party supporting it? No. They are supporting big business. Why do those on the other side hate regional Australia? We have brought in the sugar code, and Labor are opposing it and opposing certainty for the industry. On this side, the coalition will continue to deliver for regional Australia, unlike the city-centric, latte-sipping, polka-dot-sock-wearing senators on the other side, who ignore regional Australia. <span style="font-style:italic;">(Time expired)</span></span>

My question is to the Minister for Finance, Senator Cormann. Senator Cormann, last week veteran WA Liberal Party donor Julian Stawell wrote a stinging letter to The 500 Club, a body which raises money for conservative politicians, calling them to drop support for WA's six federal ministers over their lack of action on GST reform and other issues. In his letter Mr Stawell accused the Canberra six of being 'psycophantic to the Canberra establishment', Senator Cash.</span>

The second part of the answer is that Liberal members and senators from Western Australia are very strong advocates for the great state of Western Australia. The first thing we did after the most anti-WA government in the history of Australia, the Gillard Labor government, which gave us the anti-WA mining tax and the anti-WA carbon tax and which created chaos and dysfunction at our borders with illegal boat arrivals as far south in Western Australia as Geraldton—if Julia Gillard had been Prime Minister for another few months, we would have had illegal boat arrivals coming up the Swan River in Perth—</span>

                  </a>  Of course on coming into government the first thing we had to do was repair the mess and the damage that the most anti-WA government in the history of the Commonwealth had done to our great state of Western Australia. We had geniuses on the Labor side. Former Treasurer Wayne Swan—remember him?—delivered a mining tax that was designed to hit the WA mining industry for six. He thought it was going to raise millions of dollars. He spent all the money he thought it was going to raise and more and created massive uncertainty in Western Australia at the worst possible time. It is this government that got rid of it. It was the Liberal members and senators from Western Australia who repaired the damage that Labor did.</span>

                  </a>  When it comes to Western Australia and the GST-sharing arrangements it is a matter of public record that this government has actually stopped the drop in WA's share of GST at the 2014-15 level by making a $1 billion unilateral grant over two financial years to Western Australia towards infrastructure. That is more than the Labor Party ever did. I have not heard Bill Shorten suggest that he is going to take money away from Tasmania and South Australia to give it to Western Australia.

Secondly, while all ministers in the national government bring their respective perspectives as citizens in their respective states and representatives of their respective states, they do have a responsibility to take a national perspective on things, and that is what we do. Of course all of us from Western Australia, whether we are ministers or backbenchers, work every single day on how we can appropriately advance the best interests of our home states, as other senators and members in the other place would be doing. As cabinet ministers and as ministers in the national government of course ultimately we have a responsibility to focus on the national interest as well as on the interests of the respective electorates that we represent in this place.</span>

It is quite fascinating to see how much interest he pays to the internal matters of the WA Liberal Party. I think the WA Labor Party would be better served if they focused on what they were elected to do at the last state election, and that is to serve the people of Western Australia. These sorts of juvenile, university-level gibes do not do you any credit at all, Senator Sterle. Start focusing on public policy issues rather than on the internal matters of other parties. You have got enough to worry about in your party.</span>

So I know that you, Mr President, along with all colleagues, will join with me in being absolutely delighted that last week NBN reached a new connection record of 32,769 service activations in a single week. That is more than 6½ thousand services switched on each and every business day. And not only is NBN hitting new peaks each week; it has this week surpassed the two million mark for connected customers.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Thinking back to a previous time, under a previous government, the contrast has been pretty dramatic. Even looking at the last 10 months under this government, the NBN was available to one million premises in Australia but that number has now climbed to 4.4 million premises. That is an incredible achievement. The former shadow Minister, Mr Clare, described it as a jump that even Evel Knievel could not mount. Anyway, we have managed to do that. So that is good news for all colleagues on the NBN.</span>

We as a government have deliberately prioritised underserved areas and regional Australia in the NBN rollout. Today, 70 per cent of premises are able to order an NBN service in regional and non-metropolitan areas. Let me repeat that: 70 per cent of premises able to order an NBN service are in regional and non-metro areas. Around-two thirds of the rollout outside major urban areas will be through fixed line deployment and this will be supplemented, in less dense areas, with fixed wireless and satellite. Together, these technologies are delivering broadband to hundreds of thousands of homes, businesses and farms that previously had to rely on poor or non-existent connectivity. So it is a good story for regional Australia.</span>

If we simply take the numbers from NBN's weekly rollout report, which has been updated every single week since we came into government, total activations by 30 June 2011 were only 786. One year later, Labor had made the incredible progress of connecting a total of 13,000 premises! By June 2013, total connections stood at 70,100 nationwide.</span>

MHS, the current provider of 1800RESPECT, has commenced a tender process for the trauma specialist counselling component of the service. The subcontract for trauma specialist counselling has always been due to expire on 30 June this year. Rape and Domestic Violence Services Australia knew its subcontract was due to expire on 30 June, and the possibility of a tender process being conducted was raised with RDVSA on several occasions before the EOI was announced.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">MHS is responsible for this subcontracting arrangement under its contract with the department to deliver 1800RESPECT. As a first step in the tender process, MHS advertised an EOI on Tenders Online, on 14 February, inviting suitable organisations to submit a response by 17 February. MHS has invited selected organisations who responded to the EOI to submit a formal tender. The process will be open for around 30 days. The Department of Social Services does not have a role in the tender process. It is up to MHS to complete the tender and ensure it continues to meet its contractual obligations to the department. The EOI is open to appropriate services with the expertise and capacity to deliver a quality specialist trauma counselling telephone service to people impacted by family or domestic violence or sexual assault.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">MHS has advised that an independent probity officer and clinical expert with experience in family and domestic violence support services is included on the selection panel to ensure a competitive and impartial tender process. MHS has also advised that it is working with its own legal and procurement teams, as well as an external probity adviser, to ensure a smooth and fair tender process. I am advised that the minister's office has offered to provide a briefing to the senator on this issue if she wishes to take it up.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Small">That the Senate take note of the answers given by the Attorney-General (Senator Brandis) and the Minister for Employment (Senator Cash) to questions without notice asked by Senators McAllister and Cameron today relating to the annual wage review conducted by the Fair Work Commission.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">I rise to take note of the answers given by Senator Brandis and Senator Cash to questions asked by me and Senator Cameron. This may be a first for question time: this afternoon, Senator Cash has been unable to answer a basic question that is relevant to not just one but both of her portfolios. You will recall that Senator Cameron asked Senator Cash how the minimum wage would impact on the gender pay gap. But, despite being the Minister for Employment and Minister for Women, Senator Cash basically ducked the question. She named 16 per cent as the current gender pay gap, but that is just one measure, and the same agency that she oversees cites a much higher number for the gender pay gap because the gender pay gap, when you consider total full-time remuneration, is actually 23.1 per cent. It means that men are earning, on average, more than $26,000 a year more than women, and I note also that this gap is much higher in the private sector than in the public sector.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">But the big issue is that the answer she gave also completely missed the point about men's work and women's work. It is not the case that, if we wish to consider closing the gender pay gap, we need to look at higher income people, because the truth is that one of the key drivers of the gender pay gap is occupational and industrial segregation. If you want to unpack that and put it in normal language, it means that women are far more likely to work in low-paid jobs within a particular industry or within industries that have very, very low rates of pay—and the minimum wage is absolutely relevant to the take-home pay for those women and it is absolutely relevant to the gender pay gap. Thirty per cent of the gender pay gap arises from industrial and occupational segregation, and those are stats that, again, come from the minister's own agency. When we look to the future, the new, high-paid jobs that are anticipated to come into the economy seem likely to be created in industries that are dominated by men, but the new jobs that are likely to be taken by women are part time, casualised and in very, very low paid, caring industries traditionally occupied by women. Lifting the minimum wage absolutely helps to close this gap, and it is astonishing that the Minister for Women would point us away from low-paid women when we are talking about the gender pay gap and ask us to consider better paid women. The money that we are talking about might not matter that much for a partner in a law firm, but it matters for the people on the minimum wage and it matters for their families. Many of these people are in care work, caring for our ageing population, for people in our community with a disability and for children—and care work is highly feminised and underpaid.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I had a look at some of the other, more thoughtful submissions to the Fair Work Commission around this question of the minimum wage, and I took a look, you will be interested to know, Madam Deputy President, at the submission made by United Voice—because they actually do listen to real people. They do listen to the women who are working in care work and in low-paid, feminised jobs. They quote testimony from a woman named Ruth, who is a cleaner in outer suburban Sydney. She says: 'Recently I had to find the money for a deposit for three excursions. I had to go without in groceries that week to make sure we had the money.' That is the reality of the low paid in this country. This is a situation where a family, to meet the basic objectives of schooling, be part of the school community and participate in an excursion, had to go without groceries. That is disgraceful and it is astonishing that, under these circumstances, where wages are flat and where so many families are doing it tough, this government has refused to provide support for an increase to the minimum wage. I am, frankly, shocked that, in a week where the government has faced so much criticism about its heartless approach to penalty rates and its persistence in offering a $50 billion tax cut to our largest businesses and to our financial institutions, it is unable to come to grips with the seriousness of this issue and the challenges faced by low-wage people in Australia.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">
                  <a href="263418" type="MemberSpeech">
                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Senator DUNIAM</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Tasmania</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">15:11</span>):  I want to start where Senator McAllister left off in taking note of the answers given today to those questions referred to with regard to the minimum wage and the annual wage review. It is important to point out elements of the answers that were given today with regard to the importance of business as employers and the need not to impose on businesses undue burden. They are the ones paying the wages and, if a business is burdened to an extent where it becomes unviable, a non-commercial entity, then the business closes down, the jobs go and those people Senator McAllister referred to in her contribution then do not have jobs to pay for the expenses she mentioned—groceries, schooling and things like that.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">It is also important to go over some of the points that were made in the answers by ministers in question time. I think the most revealing of the points made was the fact that the government's submission to the annual wage review is extremely similar to the submissions that have been made by successive governments over many years. As we know, in the years prior to 2013, we had a Labor government, led by Prime Minister Gillard and Prime Minister Rudd, and, of course, we had an employment minister who happens now to be the Leader of the Opposition. So we need to look at what they did when they were lodging submissions to the annual wage review. Points that were made included this. Bill Shorten, as the responsible minister, said that the minimum wage should increase but not be 'set so high as to place undue financial burden on businesses, discouraging them from employing low-skilled workers', whilst also noting that Australia has one of the highest minimum wages in the developed world. That is absolutely correct and that fact stands today. We cannot ignore that fact. This notion that business is some sort of monolithic cash cow that can churn out pay rises instantaneously is just not realistic. We have to remember that in this debate.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">In her contribution, Senator McAllister also referred to the debate on penalty rates, and the same thinking should apply there, too. There is this notion going around that business can and should be able to afford pay increases all the time. The reality is that the increased burdens, the increased expenses to business and costs on running a business—small business, particuarly, where many of these low-paid workers are employed—can send these people out of business. The end result of that, of course, is that there are no jobs; they get no pay at all. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Going back to the points that have been made by ministers previously: there has been incredible consistency in the government's submissions to the annual wage review over many years. As Senator Cash said in her answer: in 2011, 2012 and 2013, all of the submissions repeated the same information, and this notion that was advanced by Senator Cameron—by interjection, I think, not in asking the question—that the advice was to get rich parents or marry up is a ridiculous suggestion in my view. No-one said that; no-one would ever suggest that. The fact that that suggestion is being made by Senator Cameron in his interjection when the submission made by this government to the annual wage review is consistent with the submissions by previous governments, including Labor governments, was made at a time when we had an employment minister in the now opposition leader, Mr Bill Shorten—is he suggesting that the submissions back then had the same message for low-paid workers? I don't think so; I think he knows how ridiculous that assertion was. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I conclude by saying: it is just cheap politics to try and pick selective quotes out of the submission to mount a case that this government is somehow the enemy of the worker, when we are doing precisely what governments before us have done. We are also supporting small business—and business generally—to create jobs and to assist them to invest so that they can keep the economy ticking over.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">
                  <a href="244247" type="MemberSpeech">
                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Senator KETTER</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Queensland</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">15:16</span>):  I listened very intently to the answers to questions asked by Senator McAllister and Senator Cameron today in relation to the minimum wage. Unfortunately, I was extremely disappointed with the responses, and I was hoping that the government senators would get on board with the much more reasonable position, which the opposition has put to the Fair Work Commission, in relation to the minimum wage case. I think it is worthwhile just pointing out the stark contrast between the opposition's position in relation to minimum wage increase as against the government's. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The opposition's submission talked about the fact that the panel's decision should be one that firmly supports a fair and economically responsible increase in the national minimum wage and all modern award wage rates—and I want to return to that point, because I think it is something that is overlooked in this debate. The opposition's submission also made reference to the fact that, whilst the opposition respects the independence of the commission, any variation of a modern award which results in the reduction of a take-home pay is unacceptable and inconsistent with the intention of parliament. We have a position where we understand that there is the prospect of a reduction in take-home pay and there is a real need for the commission to take this into account. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">It is interesting that one part of the government does not seem to understand what the other part is doing, and there is a very jumbled set of twisted priorities coming out of this government. I have mentioned in previous speeches in this place that the Treasurer, quite usefully, has said in recent times that he acknowledges that record low wage growth is the biggest challenge facing the Australian economy. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">One would have thought that, presented with the prospect of a cut to take-home pay through a penalty rate adjustment, this government should get on board with the minimum wage case and support a fair and economically responsible increase in the minimum wage. That would be the sensible thing to do, if you really do believe that low wage growth is Australia's biggest economic challenge. But, of course, here we see in the government's submission to the national wage case that they are saying that a minimum wage increase is not an efficient way to address living standards and they are throwing all sorts of other barriers in the way of the commission implementing a fair increase in minimum wages. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">It is significant to note that the national wage bench does take particular regard to the submissions of the government of the day. I think they are very, very persuasive submissions and that adds to the tragedy of the situation where we have a government which claims to be interested in addressing the issue of low wage growth but, at the same time, coming out to the national wage bench and saying: 'Be very, very cautious about what you do here. It may add to unemployment et cetera.' This is a government with mixed messages and twisted priorities, and I think the workers of Australia are entitled to be very, very disappointed with this government's approach. They do not care about the interests of ordinary workers. They stand condemned for their inaction in relation to the cut to penalty rates. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">There are some on our side of politics who understand the importance of the minimum wage case. It is a wonderful opportunity to address the issue of inclusive growth in our economy. The minimum wage does play a very important role not only for people on the actual minimum wage itself but it flows through to millions of workers who are award dependent, so this is a very important mechanism for addressing living standards, contrary to the government's submission. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">In my closing few seconds, I want to give a shout-out to Margarita Murray-Stark who, I understand, is in Parliament House, meeting with various members of parliament. Margarita is affected by the penalty rates cuts. She believes she would earn $2,000 less and has decided to come to parliament to talk to MPs and, hopefully, to the Prime Minister. So good luck, Margarita, with that.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">South Australia</span>—<span class="HPS-MinisterialTitles">Deputy Government Whip in the Senate</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">15:21</span>):  I too rise to take note of the answers to questions, and I would like to talk about some of the principles involved, the process and the purpose of the Fair Work Commission, and lastly to reflect on the politics that so underpins arguments in this place that, unfortunately, are sometimes to the detriment of constructive development of good public policy.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">In this place, for a number of years now, I thought there had been fairly broad acceptance by parties on both sides of this chamber that the conditions under which workers work and are employed—whether that comes to penalty rates or minimum wages—should be set by an independent body. That should remove much of the politics out of it. Just as we have the Reserve Bank, which is free to set interest rates, we have an independent body that makes these agreements. What that means is that it can take submissions from a wide range of people to consider both facts and, importantly, the context and how the context is changing, and the commission brings together a wide range of skills and people with different backgrounds who understand different aspects, whether it is the economy, the community or workforce implications. There are a range of perspectives that are brought to that detailed consideration of facts. So I had thought there was a well-established principle, supported by both sides of politics, that we would have an independent body to do this and remove the politicking of the parliament out of affecting the conditions that people work and live to.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The process has been followed by successive governments. Not only governments of this side but Labor governments have followed the same process. And do you know what? The submissions, in terms of their content and form, looked remarkably similar, for the simple reason that governments have departments who help advise and prepare briefs. It should be no surprise that the sorts of things they submit are similar. When Mr Shorten was the employment minister, there was no figure in his submissions on minimum wages. They put forward the same kind of principle-based arguments that the coalition government has done. So, if the Labor Party applied to their own submissions the same standard of criticism they apply to this government's submissions, they would have to come up with the same conclusions.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">In question time today they have criticised the inclusion of facts, and they cherry-picked the fact that the government's submission says that nearly half of low-paid workers are in the top 50 per cent of household income. They are saying that means that the government must be out of touch, because they are making comments like that. Well, Dr Leigh, from the opposition in the other place, made these comments shortly before Labor came to government:</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Small">Given that the typical minimum wage worker lives in a middle-income household, it appears unlikely that raising the minimum wage will significantly lower family income inequality.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Mr Shorten, in 2013 in the government submission, said:</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Small">The Panel should also consider the fact that all low paid workers do not necessarily live in low income households.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Small">…   …   …</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Small">Furthermore, the Government's analysis reveals that around 60 per cent of low-paid employees live in a household with more than one income earner and therefore their living standards are affected by income from other household members.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">So the things that, for political reasons, the opposition is dragging up and criticising the government for here have been part of the same process that their own ministers—in fact, the Leader of the Opposition when he was the responsible minister—made.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Why do the Fair Work Commission look at things like minimum wages? What are some of the things they take into account? One of the purposes, as articulated by this government and as articulated by the opposition when they were in government, is to recognise that, if you increase the minimum wage too far, you will in fact impact on small business and their ability to employ low-skilled workers. Mr Shorten has made that point himself when he was the responsible minister in government. So the principle should be supported by both sides and, until this debate, I thought it had been. The process, unsurprisingly, is the same whether the ALP or the coalition is in government. The purpose is about making sure there are more jobs. Unfortunately, the politics from the opposition gets in the way.</span>

                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Senator McCARTHY</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Northern Territory</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">15:26</span>):  What this government is refusing to do is to commit to a rise in minimum wage levels. Many Australian families are doing it really tough—much tougher than they need to, because this government would rather give tax cuts to the rich than a wage rise to struggling workers. I just want to echo Brendan O'Connor, our shadow minister for employment and workplace relations, who says that if you do not increase the minimum wage then you are ensuring that, in real terms, wages go down, because prices do not stop rising. That is why we need to make sure the minimum wage keeps up with price increases and preferably goes further to address inequality in this country—yes, inequality. That is why Labor is clear that we want to make sure that there is a decent, livable minimum wage, because we care about fairness in this country and we are concerned about inequality.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The Minister for Women today attempted to defend the government's position by arguing that there is no gender pay gap on the minimum wage. Even though women make up the majority of low-paid workers in Australia, it is all good, because they are earning the same low amounts as the minority of men on the minimum wage, because apparently it is not about gender. Perhaps the minister is not aware of the ACTU's report <span style="font-style:italic;">The gender pay gap over the life cycle</span> from last year, which revealed women are financially disadvantaged at every key stage of their lives: in childhood, at the workplace, through pregnancy, through motherhood, as a carer and in retirement. This report also found that women are earning less on average in relation to men than they were 20 years ago. Women earn around $284.20 less per week than men, and 70 per cent of part-time work is undertaken by women.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Evidence from the Census Bureau in the United States shows that, in the states with a high minimum wage, wages growth for women was strong and, in the states where the minimum wage increased in 2015, workers with the lowest incomes—those whose wages were in the bottom 10 per cent—experienced much faster wage growth than those workers in states where no minimum wage change took place. This wage growth was particularly strong for women, who make up two-thirds of low-wage workers in the US.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">There is absolutely no doubt that an increase in the minimum wage would address relative living standards and the needs of the low paid. These are workers who are still feeling the very real pain of the decision to cut penalty rates.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">In a show of just how out of touch this government truly is, it says, 'Low-paid workers are often found in high-income households.' Go and visit a household in an Alice Springs town camp where I know of working mums supporting up to 10 or more family members all living in the same three-bedroom, one-bathroom home. Go and visit a family in a remote community where you can pay up to $9 for a lettuce and tell a young person working on a minimum wage there that they do not deserve a pay rise.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The Northern Territory is certainly a wonderful place to live, but it is not an inexpensive place to live, and that is the reality. It is tough for low-income workers, and it is about to get tougher with the GST cuts affecting the Territory's budget. Young Territorians in particular are going to find it tough. A decent increase in the minimum wage would mean an enormous amount to low-income earners. A strong minimum wage helps close the gap between rich and poor; it provides a much-needed economic boost; it means people have more money to spend; and it certainly assists small business and drives local economies.</span>

                  <a href="155410" type="MemberSpeech">
                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Senator RICE</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Victoria</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">15:31</span>):  I move:</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Small">That the Senate take note of the answer given by the Minister for Resources and Northern Australia (Senator Canavan) to a question without notice asked by Senator Rice today relating to forests in Victoria.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Minister Canavan and the government in general are living in a fantasy land when it comes to the impacts of native forest logging, where, just because you say something is sustainable, it therefore becomes sustainable. The reality is that intensive, industrial scale, clear-fell logging is as sustainable and long term as whaling and sealing were in their day.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The minister was totally ignoring the facts that are at play here when we are considering the future of our forests. The facts are that in the Victorian Central Highlands there is much less forest available for logging, because of the huge areas that were lost in the 2009 fires. The Victorian government has responded by recognising that, if we are going to have an industry reliant on those native forests, we need to cut back the rate substantially. And, if you cut back the rate to a sustainable level of what is currently available, that makes that level commercially unviable, and that is what is playing out now. On the other hand, if you keep on logging at the current rates, that timber will be all gone within just a few years. That is not long term. That is not sustainable. That is not going to be what saves the jobs of the Heyfield mill workers or is in the long-term interests of the Heyfield community.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The other critical factor, of course, is that the forests that are currently being logged at an unsustainable rate are the same forests that the critically endangered Leadbeater's possum requires to survive. If we log all of those forests, what is inevitable is that that will be the death knell for Leadbeater's possums. Now the mountain ash forests are recognised as a critically endangered ecosystem. The Leadbeater's possum is critically endangered. Unless we protect enough of that forest, that will be goodbye. The Leadbeater's possum will be gone on our watch.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">So it was a huge concern that the only proposal that the minister provided in his answer to my question as to what to do about this situation is to bring forward extra years supply and to log protected areas. This is not sustainable. This is not in the interests of either the wood products industry or the environment. It is not going to save the Heyfield jobs; it is just going to be putting off the inevitable. Basically, it is like giving the whaling fleet open-slather access to whale sanctuaries.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The minister totally ignored the nub of my question, which was about the transition that is underway in the wood products industry in Australia, which needs to be supported, needs to be encouraged and needs to be completed. That is the transition out of that outdated, old, 'dig it up, log it, chop it down' mentality and the shift to plantations.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We are now in the situation where 85 per cent of the wood products being produced in Australia are coming from plantations. That is the future of the industry. Any forward-thinking government would be recognising that and saying, 'Okay, how do we shift now that remaining last bit of the industry to plantations?' They would not be propping up that damaging, outdated industry that is based on native forests.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The other critical factor is that, by completing that transition to plantations and protecting native forests, from a jobs perspective that is a win-win because you can then facilitate and allow the jobs in the recreation industries and the tourism industries to flourish. There is so much potential employment in those areas. We can have ongoing jobs in the wood products industry being based on plantations by increasing that 85 per cent to 100 per cent, and we can then unlock the tourism potential of our native forests.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">It is a total furphy to say that if we do not log our forests we are going to import more. In fact, we are exporting hardwood sawlogs from our native forests. In Victoria there were 24,000 cubic metres of hardwood logs that were exported from our forests. This is not a matter of protecting international forests. This is just the industry going on a rampage. It is possible to end the forest wars. By transitioning the timber industry to plantations completely, we can be saving timber jobs; we can be protecting our forests for their wildlife and for their water and as carbon stores soaking up and storing that carbon, as we need to do; and we can be protecting our jobs for everyone—all Australians and all Melburnians—to enjoy.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Small">This Bill introduces a measure that was announced in the 2016-17 </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">Mid-Year Economic and Fiscal Outlook that will provide a two year trial of incentives aimed at increasing the number of eligible job seekers who undertake horticultural seasonal work, such as fruit picking.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">The measure responds to concerns about the ability of the Australian horticulture industry to attract sufficient numbers of seasonal workers by introducing three incentives aimed at increasing the number of job seekers who undertake horticultural seasonal work.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">The incentives will commence as a trial from 1 July 2017 for two years and will be capped at 7,600 participants over the two years. There are three incentives. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">Under the first incentive, Newstart and Youth Allowance (Other) recipients who have been receiving those payments continuously for at least three months will have access to a Seasonal Horticultural Work Income Exemption. Under this exemption, they will be able to earn up to $5,000 each year without it being assessed under the social security income test. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">A period during which a person did not receive Newstart and Youth Allowance (Other) because of employment income (known as an employment income nil rate period) will count towards the period of three months continuous receipt.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">Eligible job seekers will be able to access the $5,000 income test incentive in each of the 2017-18 and 2018-19 financial years. Eligible job seekers who participate in the second year of the trial will have access to the $5,000 income test concession for up to 12 months from when they enter the trial in the second year. However, if they participate in the second year of the trial, any unused balance from the first year will expire.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">The concession will only apply to earnings from specified horticultural seasonal work. Eligible employment for this measure will be seasonal, short-term employment in the horticulture industry picking and packing fruit, nuts or other crops in rural or regional Australia. The Employment Secretary may determine by way of a legislative instrument what constitutes qualifying seasonal horticultural work.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">Employment could be directly with a farmer or with a contractor/labour hire company where the principal business is the supply of labour for harvest. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">Qualification rules will be relaxed for this group so that they continue to qualify for Newstart and Youth Allowance (Other) while undertaking eligible horticultural seasonal work. The amendments in the Bill mainly relate to this incentive.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">This income test concession will provide a strong incentive for jobseekers to participate in the trial and undertake horticultural seasonal work and a practical opportunity to build work experience and skills.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">As an example, currently, a recipient of Newstart Allowance who is single and has no children can earn $104 a fortnight before their payment starts to be reduced and $1036.34 a fortnight before their Newstart Allowance reduces to nil.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">Under this measure, if the Newstart Allowance recipient participates in the trial, they could earn up to $5,000 from qualifying horticultural seasonal work over a 12 month period and continue to receive the full rate of Newstart Allowance.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">Under the second incentive, Newstart and Youth Allowance (Other) recipients who have been receiving those payments continuously for at least three months and participate in the trial would be eligible for a Seasonal Work Living Away and Travel Allowance of up to $300 each year, if they undertake horticultural seasonal work more than 120 km from their home. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">This payment removes a disincentive to undertake seasonal work by recognising the additional expense that may be incurred by job seekers travelling significant distances from their principal place of residence to take up an eligible seasonal job. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">The payment will generally be made on a weekly basis ($50 per week to a maximum of $300 over six weeks), although employment providers will have the flexibility to tailor the payment to suit the needs of the job seeker. For example, a provider may provide a greater amount up front to cover higher initial accommodation or transport costs.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">There would be no requirement for the job seeker to acquit the payment. If a job seekers employment ends part way through a working week, the job seeker would only be entitled to the payment for the completed part of that week. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">The Bill includes a provision so that the Seasonal Work Living Away and Travel Allowance would not be assessed as income for income support purposes.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">Under the third incentive, Employment providers, including jobactive, Transition to Work and Disability Employment Services, will be paid a $100 per week placement incentive fee for a maximum of six weeks for each job seeker that they successfully refer to a seasonal job as part of the trial. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">Providers will remain eligible for the payment for as long as the job seeker remains employed, for a maximum of six weeks, in the seasonal job.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">This Seasonal Work Incentives measure is expected to cost $27.5 million over the forward estimates.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">This amount includes funding for the Department of Social Services and the Department of Employment to evaluate the effectiveness of these incentives during the two year trial period. The evaluation will be completed before the end of the trial to enable the Government to consider whether incentives to encourage people to take up seasonal work should be continued.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">Conclusion</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">The incentives for job seekers to undertake seasonal work will help to respond to the concerns of the Australian horticulture industry about their ability to attract sufficient numbers of seasonal workers.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">They are aimed at helping to increase the number of unemployed Australians who participate in seasonal work, and therefore the number of seasonal workers available to work on Australian farms and orchards.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">The incentives will also provide job seekers with a practical opportunity to enter the workforce and to build work experience and skills.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">In the best interest of the Australian horticulture industry and job seekers, I seek the support of the Parliament for the passing of this measure.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Small">Mr President, today I present the Joint Standing Committee on Treaties' <span style="font-style:italic;">Report 168 </span>which contains the Committee's review of amendments to the <span style="font-style:italic;">Agreement on Certain Maritime Arrangements in the Timor Sea</span> with Timor‑Leste, commonly known as the CMATS Treaty.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">Australia and Timor‑Leste have not agreed to a permanent maritime boundary in the Timor Sea. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">In the absence of such an agreement, the CMATS Treaty provides for the joint development of petroleum and gas reserves in the Timor Sea, known as Greater Sunrise. These reserves have an estimated value of A$40 billion. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">The CMATS Treaty provides that future revenue from the development of Greater Sunrise will be shared equally between Australia and Timor‑Leste. It also places a moratorium on establishing a permanent maritime boundary. To date, Greater Sunrise has not been developed. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">The amendments to the CMATS Treaty reviewed by the Committee are largely procedural in nature, necessary prior to its termination on 10 April. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">Indeed, the CMATS Treaty was terminated unilaterally by Timor‑Leste on 10 January 2017 following an agreement between Australia and Timor‑Leste to negotiate permanent maritime boundaries. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">Mr President, termination of a treaty would usually cease all operation and effect of its clauses.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">However, Article 12(4) of the CMATS Treaty gives continuing effect to a number of provisions that would re‑enliven the whole Treaty if Greater Sunrise was developed in the future. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">As agreed between Australia and Timor‑Leste, the proposed treaty action under review amends Article 12(4) so that it will not survive beyond termination of the whole Treaty. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">The Committee's report also notes that the CMATS Treaty gave Timor‑Leste a larger share of the Greater Sunrise resources than it would have under pre‑existing arrangements. These pre-existing arrangements will govern the joint-development of Greater Sunrise until such time as a permanent maritime boundary is negotiated. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">Mr President, the Committee is of the strong view that the maritime boundary dispute should be negotiated bilaterally and in good faith, and commends both Governments for agreeing to operate by these principles. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">Consequently, the Committee's report recommends to the Parliament that the proposed treaty action to amend Article 12(4) proceed. This recognises that the termination of the CMATS Treaty is a first step towards further negotiation on maritime boundaries. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">Mr President, the Committee has recommended that binding treaty action be taken. However, in supporting the proposed treaty action, the Committee has requested that the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade brief the Committee every six months until this matter is resolved. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">I note that the negotiations with Timor‑Leste will occur within the confines of the Conciliation Commission, and remain confidential. The Committee will, where necessary, hear such briefings in closed session. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">These briefings will give the Committee the necessary context to review subsequent treaty actions, should Australia and Timor‑Leste reach an agreement on maritime boundaries in the Timor Sea. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">Mr President, on behalf of the Committee, I commend the Report to the Senate.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Small">I am writing to clarify the arrangements being put in place to support Budget Based Funded (BBF) services to operate under the Jobs for Families Child Care Package (the Package).</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">BBF services play an important role in their community, providing much needed early learning and school aged care or family support services, often in challenging circumstances. I am committed to ensuring that valuable community services continue to operate beyond the introduction of the Package. I want to assure you that you will be able to continue to tailor the delivery of your service to the needs of families in your communities. This includes delivering culturally focussed and integrated services to ensure that the needs of all children are met. The Department of Education and Training is working hard to support BBF funding recipients to enable your service to operate effectively in the new child care system. To this end, I thought it would be useful to set out my commitments to you and your communities.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">Firstly, I can assure you the changes under the Package do not come into effect until July 2018. Your current BBF funding agreement ends on 30 June 2017 and as per usual practice, in 2017 we will issue funding agreements for the 2017-18 year. You should not be concerned that BBF funding will cease before the introduction of the Package.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">The next 18 months is a period of transition. I will ensure my department continues to work closely with you during this time and beyond, to support your service's successful transition to the Child Care Subsidy (CCS). This work has commenced with PricewaterhouseCoopers (PwC) who have been preparing assessments of the capacity of your service to operate in the new child care system. As you know, this work has involved PwC visiting funding recipients to develop a good understanding of your service, families in your local communities and to better understand the current business and operating model in the context of the Package. PwC has also worked with funding recipients on a range of options for your service in transitioning to the new arrangements. This has been documented in your transition plans. Centre-based services should have received a copy of their plan, and mobile services will receive theirs by early 2017, if not before. This work has been conducted on a service-by-service basis because each service is unique and we want to ensure that the good things already happening continue to take place after the transition to the new package.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">This is important work, but it is just the beginning. There will be more support commencing in early 2017 based on the needs identified in the transition reports. PwC and my department will work closely to tailor this support and ensure key issues are addressed.</span>

                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">There are a number of BBF services for which the core purpose is not child care, but family or community support. The Prime Minister, the Hon Malcolm Turnbull MP, has given a firm commitment that we will identify alternative funding sources for these services and support them to transition to these new arrangements. I am working with my ministerial colleagues to find the best solution for these services and the PwC reports will support this work.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Small">As you know, the current BBF program is capped and closed to new providers and does not have capacity to respond to changes in demand or to enable new services to open where they are needed. As a result, some BBF services receive tens of thousands of dollars per child while others have to manage on less than $100 per child. The total funding available for BBF services has remained stagnant in real terms, while funding for mainstream child care has increased steadily for many years. I understand that some stakeholders have called for a separate grant fund for Aboriginal services. To do this would create these same issues, whereby artificial limits would be set, and services would not be paid according to the numbers of children that attend. I want to ensure that services supporting our most disadvantaged families have access to the same opportunities for additional funding available to other child care services.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Small">The Package to be introduced in July 2018 has been designed to support a diverse range of services so that they have the flexibility to adapt to the needs of local families. As part of these reforms, families and BBF services will be able to access funding streams they have not been able to access previously. When combined, these funding streams will exceed the funding available through the BBF program:</span>

                  <span class="HPS-SmallBullet">the Child Care Subsidy (CCS) is a per child payment. Services with more children than currently recognised through their BBF funding allocation will benefit.

                  <span class="HPS-Small">The Senate References Committee calls on the Government to commit to funding schools on the basis of need.

                  <span class="HPS-Small">Unfortunately, as a result of Labor's negotiations, current funding levels are determined by historic levels, special deals and complex transition arrangements that vary by states and sector.

In the 2016–17 Budget the Government announced additional funding of $118.2 million in 2016 and 2017 for schools to support students with disability. This funding is on top of the increases in funding that the Government is providing to all sectors across all states and territories through the existing loading and targeted to those schools with the greatest need.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Small">All Australian governments and sectors are working together to reforms aimed at improving the lives of people with disability. This includes broad reforms such as the National Disability Strategy 2010–20 and the National Disability Insurance Scheme, as well as specific reforms to improve education outcomes for students with disability. In particular, the Government put in place the Disability Standards for Education 2005 (the Standards) to ensure students with disability can access and participate in education on the same basis as other students.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Small">In December 2015, revised Accreditation Standards and Procedures were agreed by all Education Ministers that provide specific guidance to providers on how to ensure their students meet the Graduate level of the Australian Professional Standards for Teachers.

                  <span class="HPS-Small">The Government has also supported the capacity of teachers to address the needs of students with disability through: funding the Australian Special Education Principals' Association to lead the development of a suite of national resources to support inclusive learning environments; providing funding to enable free access to an AUSPELD learning difficulties and dyslexia resource; providing additional support and professional development through the implementation on the Nationally Consistent Collection of Data on School Students with Disability (NCCD); and funding the Positive Partnerships program under the Helping Children with Autism initiative.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Small">The Government is disappointed the Committee did not call on state and territory education authorities to appear at the Inquiry to share examples of good education practices providing for the specific needs of students with disability that are currently occurring systemically in Australian schools. While the Senate References Committee heard some examples of schools, principals, teachers and parents creating a positive environment for students with disability, the report primarily focused on the barriers faced by students with disability.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Small">There is considerable work ahead to ensure students with disability are able to achieve optimal educational outcomes. However, it needs to also be acknowledged that there has been significant systemic reform in the education of students with disability over the past decade.</span>

                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">South Australia</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">15:48</span>):  I rise today to speak to the Human Rights Legislation Amendment Bill 2017 that has been tabled in this parliament and that we have spent the last few days debating. It strikes me that this piece of legislation is an awful waste of time for this chamber, seeing as we know that the government does not have support to get this legislation through and we know that it is purely an exercise to appease the right-wing rump on the Prime Minister's back benches. We know that this bill is causing a lot of concern, anxiety and worry to people right across this country.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The Racial Discrimination Act is a law that is meant to protect people. It is meant to ensure that members of our community feel safe, by protecting them from racial vilification, from being humiliated because of who they are, where they were born, their family background and who they are as a human being. It is meant to protect people from feeling lesser than others. It strikes me, listening to the debate in this place over the last few days, that this bill has been put forward not to make people feel protected or safe in our communities but to somehow protect the people who want to spew hatred. The debate has been absolutely backwards. It has all been about the right for people to behave in ways that are pretty nasty and to belittle others. Somehow giving rights to the racists is more important than protecting a piece of legislation that is designed to ensure that every person in our community can feel safe—safe in who they are and safe to catch a bus without thinking that, just because they happen to have a Greek, Italian, Chinese, Malaysian, Fijian or Muslim family background, they may be vilified in public.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I think it is a really sad day for this parliament that we are going to be sitting late into the night because there are some people in this place—some people on this Prime Minister's government benches—who desperately want to take away people's right to feel safe and secure in their own communities. It is, sadly, an indictment of this parliament that we are allowing hours and hours of debating time to give rights to a bunch of racists, to people so they can be meaner and nastier—to say, 'That is okay. That is the type of society that people want to live in.' Well, it is not.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Australia has such a rich history of embracing multiculturalism, and we have done it very, very well. When you travel to other parts of the world, one of things that really stick out when you tell people that you are from Australia is what a successful multicultural country we are seen as. Rather than debating a piece of legislation that appeases the trolls, we should be finding ways to strengthen and embrace the richness of our multicultural diversity. Why on earth are we spending hours debating what rights racists and bigots should have, instead of what we can be doing to support, and show empathy and compassion for, those who are already feeling pretty under fire in our communities right now?</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Let us be totally honest about what has dominated this debate to date. It is about a bunch of people who want to vilify, in particular, Muslims—and we know that because we heard Senator Roberts, only two days ago, say some of the most disgusting and awful things about people just because they happen to be of Muslim faith. He is a man who has particular privilege. He is in the Senate; he gets to stand up here and say the awful things he wants to say, and no-one can do anything about it. That is what privilege looks like. But with privilege comes responsibility. We have a responsibility as leaders in this chamber and in this parliament to stand up for people who do not have a voice—to ensure that somebody who is being vilified or feels under fire in our community does not become alienated just because of who they are, where they were born or who their parents are, or whether they wear a headscarf or not. The anti-Muslim crusade that has been spewed by One Nation, from that corner of the chamber, over the last week has been revolting. The truth is that they can say anything they want because they have parliamentary privilege. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We are seeing hours and entire days of this chamber dominated by a bill that is entitled 'Human Rights Legislation Amendment' when it really should be 'trolls amendment bill'. This is about appeasing a bunch of privileged, nasty racists and giving them more protections, and weakening the protections of people who genuinely, and worryingly, need more protection.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I have met a lot of young Muslim women in my time as a senator in this place—16- and 17-year-old Hazara girls from Adelaide, or university students who have come to Australia with their families because their dads and their mums believe their daughters have the right to a good education and want their daughters to get a good education. They want their daughters to be able to succeed at university. They move their families to Australia so that their girls can be the best they can be and do what it is they want to do. What I talk to these young women in my home state and in other places around the country, their stories of how they feel, living in our communities, are horrifying. They cannot catch a bus without being concerned that someone is going to abuse them because they are wearing a headscarf, or walk down the street without somebody in a car yelling at them. They get home to find abuse on their Facebook page. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The people who behave like that do not need any more protection. They do not need any more rights. We should be finding ways to embrace diversity and look after those people who are already under fire, who are already feeling vilified and isolated. The trolls have been well represented in this place over the last couple of days, and it has not been a very pleasant thing to have to deal with in this chamber.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Senator Hanson yesterday challenged people to explain why she is referred to as a racist. She is upset that people call her a racist. You know what? If you say racist things, people are going to call you out for it. If you do not want to be accused of being a racist, don't say racist things. If you do not want people calling you out for it, keep your mouth shut. If you do not have anything nice to say, don't say anything. This is not about the thought police; this is about basic humanity and decency.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Senator Hanson said she did not believe that she was a racist. Well, when she said, 'I believe we are in danger of being swamped by Asians,' and, 'They have their own culture and religion, form ghettos and do not assimilate,' in her maiden speech in 1996, that sounded pretty racist to me. Of course, only last year she said:</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This is pure hate coming from the mouth of one of our own senators sitting here in this place, someone who should be speaking up for decency and humanity, and all we get is the opposite.</span>

                    </a>  I was, of course, referring to Senator Hanson. This bill has been debated in this place in such a way that it is the rights of people to be racist and nasty versus the rights of others in the community to be safe. There is a lot of talk about the rights of racists and, apparently, the need for them to have more protection; not much talk about how we work to unify our country. Laws are made to protect people, not to protect the perpetrators. Australia is better than this—much, much better than this. That is why I am thankful that, despite the waste of time on this nasty, pathetic, small-minded piece of legislation today, it will be rejected because, deep in their hearts, most members in this chamber understand that Australians do not accept this.</span>

I do not think there is any Australian—I do not know anyone—who works all day, picks up their kids after school, gets home, cooks the dinner, sits down and says: 'Oh, you should've seen what happened to me today. I just couldn't be a racist. What is this country coming to?' No-one in their right mind who believes in this country being the best it can be thinks that we need to weaken our laws. No-one believes that except the people who want to continue to get away with spreading hatred and stirring hatred for their own political gain.</span>

                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">One of the worst things about this piece of legislation is just how bitterly disappointing the Prime Minister has been in all of this. The Prime Minister has put this piece of legislation up purely for internal politics. He was prepared to give a space where we had Senator Roberts stand up and vilify whole swags of the Australian Muslim community. He gave Senator Roberts—as a middle-aged white guy—a platform to stand here and say all of these awful things under the privilege of the parliament. The Prime Minister allowed that to happen, all because he is worried about his own internal political fight in his own party. He is bitterly disappointing on this.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This bill never should have been brought to this parliament. The fact that this is a piece of government legislation that we are debating in government time says so much about the character of the Prime Minister, Malcolm Turnbull: weak, under siege and spineless. The leader of our nation is meant to be somebody who unites people, who talks about what makes us a great country, but instead he has provided an entire week of debate where we have seen members of our Australian community denigrated and vilified in our chambers of parliament. And our Prime Minister has sat by and said, 'Oh, this is what I want my last week of this sitting period to be dominated by.' He is weak, he is spineless and this is not a human rights amendment bill; this is Malcolm Turnbull's appeasement to the trolls bill. That is what is in this chamber today. That is what has to be voted down tonight.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I do not want to hear over and over again when we get to committee stage that we have to have more rights for people like Senator Hanson and Senator Roberts to stand in this place under privilege, kick members of other cultural groups and communities just because they do not like them and then have the gall to say that somebody might dare call their senators and their party a bunch of racists. If you don't want to be accused of being a racist, don't do it.</span>

                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">
                    <a href="266499" type="MemberSpeech">
                      <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Senator HUME</span>
                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Victoria</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">16:08</span>):  I rise this afternoon to speak on the government's Human Rights Legislation Amendment Bill 2017. As we all know, this bill contains three elements. It contains reforms to section 18C of the Racial Discrimination Act 1975, it amends the complaints-handling processes of the Human Rights Commission under the Australian Human Rights Commission Act 1986 and it also makes minor amendments to the Australian Human Rights Commission Act specifically sought by the commission to enhance its operation and its efficiency.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Let's first deal with the issue of amendments to the complaints-handling process. These amendments give effect to the majority of recommendations of the Parliamentary Joint Committee on Human Rights in its report on freedom of speech in Australia tabled in parliament less than a month ago. The bill also amends the Australian Human Rights Commission Act in line with the recommendations made by the commission itself, and these will have the effect of reducing its regulatory and administrative burden, reforming reporting requirements and clarifying the commission's conciliation process and governance arrangements. The commission wanted and in fact requested these specific changes.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">These amendments will restore public confidence in the commission's processes and thereby restore confidence in the commission itself. They will bring certainty to both complainants and respondents to complaints of unlawful discrimination and they will ensure that all parties to a complaint are accorded procedural fairness.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">But procedural amendments are clearly not enough. The language of section 18C of the Racial Discrimination Act has lost all credibility. The government now seeks to replace that language to better reflect the intent of the legislation, to make the Racial Discrimination Act clearer, to make the Racial Discrimination Act stronger and to make the Racial Discrimination Act fairer. The bill will amend the Racial Discrimination Act to redefine conduct prohibited by 18C to more accurately reflect and encompass the notion of racial vilification. It does this by removing the words 'offend', 'insult' and 'humiliate' and replaces them with the word 'harass', making it a prohibited act to harass or intimidate anyone on the basis of race. The bill also introduces an objective standard in which a reasonable member of the Australian community would judge that an act of harassment or intimidation validly occurs rather than the standard of a hypothetical representative of a particular group.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The Racial Discrimination Act 1975 is a law that was developed with good intentions. It was developed to defend the vulnerable, to articulate the principles of a successful multicultural society and to reflect our values of inclusion and acceptance. They are values that we hold dear. Australia is arguably the most successful multicultural nation on this earth. We value not just tolerance but acceptance, not just inclusion but immersion. Our migrant heritage has allowed our great nation to flourish economically and culturally. In 2017 you would be hard-pressed to find an Australian without friends, colleagues or extended family members who hailed from other countries and other cultures. And by far the vast majority of Australians treat those who hail from near and far with respect, with dignity and often with great admiration. The vast majority of Australians decry racism and denounce those who vilify others on the basis of race or behave menacingly towards those we embrace. This was the intention of the Racial Discrimination Act.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">But what has become apparent is that the Racial Discrimination Act is a law that gave practical effect to making it unlawful to hurt people's feelings. The only sensible course of action is to redirect 18C towards more serious conduct. The law should provide protection from racial vilification and it should do so in a manner that is consistent with Australia's obligations under the International Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Racial Discrimination. However, this protection needs to be consistent with the right of freedom of speech, which is the cornerstone of a strong and healthy liberal democracy. Effective protection against racial vilification need not curtail freedom of speech. However, section 18C in its current form potentially does so and at the same time does not provide any extra protection from racial vilification. The amendments that have been proposed have a dual purpose: they provide stronger and clearer laws about what constitutes racial vilification of freedom of speech.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Strengthening the Racial Discrimination Act by removing the subjective terms 'offend', 'insult' and 'intimidate' and replacing them with the word 'harass' has a dual effect. Removing the words addresses the disconnect between the ordinarily understood meaning of these terms and the way they have been judicially interpreted, and the concept of 'harass' in section 18C will be clarified in the bill to also include a single act. It can include, for instance, a person who is verbally attacked on a bus, as Senator Hanson-Young expressed, purely on the basis of their race. That single act will constitute an act of harassment.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Australia's legal community has made it very clear that the act in its current form renders the law vulnerable to a High Court challenge, a concern that the Australian Law Reform Commission clearly stated in its 2015 report. I will quote directly from that report:</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">The inclusion of the words 'offend' and 'insult' raises a possibility that the High Court, in an appropriate case, might read down the scope of section 18C, or find it invalid.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">But it is not just the Australian Law Reform Commission that has called for urgent reform to the Racial Discrimination Act. Countless others of varying political persuasions have been united in their concern over the ramifications of a law that limits free speech. Tony Morris QC was the barrister for two of the QUT students in the Prior versus Queensland University of Technology case. Tony Morris said: </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">For far too long, 18C’s wording has misled complainants, feeling en­titled to object to the slightest insult or offence (the QUT case is an example par excellence), and respondents, imagining they are liable even for trivial discourtesies.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Section 18C has been the only law in Australia and perhaps the only law in the world by which liability is determined exclusively from the standpoint of would-be victims. Indeed, Warren Mundine, the former president of the ALP, told <span style="font-style:italic;">The Australian</span> that the low bar of the existing law meant that we were not capturing the real racists, but catching normal everyday people like the Queensland university students and cartoonist Bill Leak.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Mr Shorten said that the proposed changes would open the gates to racists and take advantage of their new green light to insult, offend and humiliate. But Mr Mundine, a man I know you deeply respect, Mr Acting Deputy President Sterle, said:</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">I don't agree because I am a person who believes in free speech.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">He said he was very supportive of the changes to 18C because it had become a big stick and there were lots of people who had been beaten with that stick. It stifles debate on confronting real issues.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Professor George Williams, a former ALP preselection candidate and the current dean of law at the University of New South Wales, also said:</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">Despite its limited operation, there is a good case for amending section 18C … the law should proscribe extreme forms of speech such as racial vilification and incitement to violence. Section 18C goes too far in applying to more minor forms of speech, in particular words that offend or insult.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I know that David Marr has been quoted in this chamber numerous times in this debate, and that is because he truly is a lion of the Left. As a journalist for <span style="font-style:italic;">The Guardian</span>, on March 15 this year, he wrote:</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">I want 'offend' and 'insult' taken out of section 18C of the Racial Discrimination Act. I don't think the law should engage at that level. But I can't see that this country would be a better, freer place if 'humiliate' and 'intimidate' went too.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Dr Sev Ozdowski, the former Human Rights Commissioner, also said:</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">
                    <span style="&#xD;&#xA;    font-size:9.5pt;&#xD;&#xA;  ">There should be no right to not be offended.</span>
                  </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">That is a quote from <span style="font-style:italic;">The Australian</span>. He also said:</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">There is no doubt in my mind that racism needs to be curtailed, but I am yet to see solid empirical evidence that the insertion of section 18C into the act in 1995 diminished racism.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">He also said to the Parliamentary Joint Committee on Human Rights:</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">… I have seen the chilling effects of that legislation on the discussion of any cultural characteristics. Questions about cultural practices are risky to ask. It also builds resentment and distrust. It creates a 'them and us' attitude. In my view, it may put multiculturalism at risk. It also creates enormous repercussions that damage the respondent to a complaint, regardless of whether the allegation is proved or not. Being accused of racism is a similar thing to being accused of sexual violence. It is having a very negative impact on people who are accused of racism.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">And I note that Senator Hanson-Young did that very thing in this chamber this afternoon, which was very disappointing. Sue Gordon, who is a Western Australian magistrate and also an Indigenous community leader said:</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">Gagging people from fairly and legitimately held opinions is censorship. It is a basic denial of freedom of speech …</span>
                </p>

                  <span class="HPS-Small">The underlying problem with the ill-considered effects of Section 18C is that if someone says they have been offended or humiliated, who is to challenge them? That is not what freedom of speech and the right to fairly voice your opinions is about</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Clearly, section 18C is stymieing legitimate debate that is potentially useful and healthy. It is stopping that, not necessarily because the conduct would contravene section 18C, but because of the fear of legal action and the untold reputational, financial and often personal damage that might ensue from that. Importantly, what is the point of a law that does not do the exact thing it was meant to do? What is the point of a law that does not capture those who genuinely vilify, harass or intimidate? Our current law as it stands with 18C is not capturing those who abuse and menace a stranger on a bus, as Senator Hanson-Young pointed out.</span>

                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Those people on a bus are certainly not protected by 18C now. A woman on a bus who gets abused purely for wearing a niqab or for being of a particular race or a particular colour is not protected at all by 18C. The current law is not capturing those who participated in the Cronulla riots or the anti-immigration protests in Melbourne or Sydney, wearing bandannas and anonymously menacing those of other races. Instead, it is capturing students, who were doing nothing more than decrying the unfairness of an Indigenous-only computer lab on social media. That is a very minor slight indeed. Instead, it captures cartoonists like Bill Leak, whose very role is to satirise.</span>

We value our heritage, our diversity, our prosperity and our progress, but we are also a nation that values our freedoms, and freedom of speech is fundamental, elemental, to all other freedoms.

                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Tasmania</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">16:26</span>):  I rise to speak on the Human Rights Legislation Amendment Bill 2017. Weakening section 18C was debated for a long time before reform was introduced into this parliament, but I still do not believe that the case has been made for reform. Section 18C functions well as it is. It strikes the right balance between freedom of speech and a legal incentive to protect victims of verbal or written abuse. Section 18C cannot be read in isolation; it needs to be read alongside section 18D, which has the exemptions to section 18C and protects freedom of speech. Section 18D says:</span>
                </p>

                  <span class="HPS-Small">(a) in the performance, exhibition or distribution of an artistic work; or</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">So it is clear that, if you have good and appropriate intentions, your right to freedom of speech is protected under section 18D.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">But why should this area be regulated by law? The debate has clearly shown that one person's opinion is another person's hate speech. This debate has shown that in a world that is made up of a variety of people with different experiences, backgrounds, make up and different levels of resilience, we need a benchmark to let Australians know what is and is not appropriate. Section 18C does not restrict freedom of speech; it is about providing a benchmark for human decency.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">While I believe it is important for parliament to undertake moments of self-reflection, to examine the culture it is creating, this debate is less self-reflection and more a political football for all parties involved. I am sympathetic to the pressures Prime Minister Turnbull has to deal with within his party, but the Liberal Party's issues of disunity should not be played out on the Senate floor at the expense of legislation that impacts the day-to-day lives of everyday Australians, small to medium businesses, veterans, pensioners, families and students.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The legislation that impacts on these groups, the majority of Australians, is what must be given priority in the Senate chamber. If the changes to the pension asset test were given the same amount of airtime as section 18C, the same amount of consideration within the Liberal Party and the same amount of opposition by Labor, perhaps hundreds of thousands of pensioners would not have had their fortnightly payments cut this year. If the freeze to the family tax benefit last week had been given the same amount of airtime, the same amount of consideration within the Liberal Party and the same amount of opposition by Labor as section 18C, perhaps hundreds of thousands of families would not lose almost $2 billion from their payments.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We have a budget coming up—our economy is in dire straits, according to the Liberal-National party—and instead of governing you are kicking around issues that are of no value for families and pensioners, who no longer know how they are going to put food on the table. The Liberal government is not running the country. The Liberal government, once again, through its own self-interest, is just wasting time.</span>

                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Western Australia</span>—<span class="HPS-MinisterialTitles">Deputy Government Whip in the Senate</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">16:31</span>):  The Human Rights Legislation Amendment Bill 2017, the bill that we are discussing here this afternoon, is a triumph for our parliamentary system of government, a triumph for the Senate, a triumph for the Senate committee process and, indeed, a triumph for the joint committee process of our parliament. Free speech is an issue I have taken a lot of time exploring. Indeed, much of my parliamentary time over the last two years has been spent on this issue—as well as other issues. This is my eighth speech on the importance of free speech in this country and reform to our free speech laws.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">People would not be surprised to learn that people in this Senate chamber have different views about the suitability of the government's amendments to free speech laws in our country. That is actually not important, that is actually not a surprise. What is important, and what we can put our faith in, is the fact that there was a contentious issue and the government, in its wisdom—and I will come to the reasons for this in a moment—did decide to trust the parliament, through the Joint Parliamentary Committee on Human Rights, to explore this issue and canvass the breadth of issues and people's attitude to them.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I note that Senator McKim is in the chamber, as he often has been when we have been debating these points. What happened was that we had a very civilised process—and Senator McKim is nodding his head—where the community got to put their views. I would argue that, during the course of the parliamentary joint committee inquiry, the tempo of the debate subsided a bit, became a bit more civilised, became a bit more rational because people had a forum through which to impart their views. And then the committee—comprising government members, opposition members, the Australian Greens and independent members of the Senate and the House of Representatives—came to a report. Again, people should not be surprised that there were differences of opinion in that report. There should be differences of opinion, because our system of government is a parliamentary democracy, not a totalitarian regime. And what is interesting is that, in that body of evidence that was presented to the committee, there were many things that were actually agreed to by the committee. That is my first point. What the committee report found for itself, based on a substantial body of evidence, was that there was cause for reform of the Australian Human Rights Commission complaints processes. Tick. That was a very good and important outcome—reforms that are broadly endorsed.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Less surprising was that there was a difference of opinion about how the issue of free speech, through the lens of provisions 18C and 18D of the Racial Discrimination act, should be reformed. The government came to a view that reform is necessary. And that is where we are today. We are in the Australian Senate debating the suitability of these reforms because the parliament applied itself to the task, invited community opinions, a body of evidence emerged and, on the basis of that, the government is bringing some proposed reforms to the Senate and we are debating them here and we will get an outcome in the next day or two. That is a triumph for our parliamentary democracy.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Those of us who, like me, have been champions of reform do feel satisfied that, no matter what the outcome is today or tomorrow, a proper process has endured, a substantial body of evidence has emerged and the parliament, being a representation of the people in our community, in the Senate, will make a decision.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I would like to share with the Senate and put into the <span style="font-style:italic;">Hansard</span> some paragraphs of a letter that I wrote to the Attorney-General in October last year, when I advocated for a parliamentary inquiry, when I specifically sought the government's endorsement of the Parliamentary Joint Committee on Human Rights to conduct that inquiry. By way of background, in the previous parliament I had the honour of being the chairman of the Parliamentary Joint Committee on Human Rights. I have some of the scars and some of the bruises to prove my tenure as chairman of that committee. I would not have established a Parliamentary Joint Committee on Parliament Rights had I been in the parliament at the time of its creation. I do not think it is necessary, because I think there are other forums in which to debate and discuss issues around civil liberties in our country—namely, the Senate Scrutiny of Bills Committee. But that is a debate for another time.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">In arguing my case to the government that the issue was worthy enough for a parliamentary inquiry and that the Parliamentary Joint Committee on Human Rights was the right forum, I had this to say to the Attorney-General: 'Over recent months, there has been a broadening of community calls for the greater protection of free speech in Australia. This debate has been given added impetus by the prosecution of university students in Queensland on the basis of alleged racial discrimination for comments made on social media, as well as a decision by the Australian Human Rights Commission to launch an investigation of cartoonist Bill Leak and <span style="font-style:italic;">The Australian</span> newspaper on the grounds that the cartoon was allegedly racist. Now, more than ever'—and I was writing at the very end of October last year—'it is appropriate to fully test community attitudes to whether our current laws are adequately protecting freedom of expression in Australia. I am writing to urge the government to give serious consideration to a parliamentary inquiry into the rights and responsibilities that arise from the exercise of freedom of expression in Australia and what improvements could be made to our current laws to optimise freedom of expression in our country.'</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">That is an important paragraph because what has been missing in this debate is this point: it is not enough just to change the law. That is the easy part, but, if the law should change, it is then beholden on all of us, most particularly those like me, who have been reformists, not just to champion free speech but to jump to the defence of people and condemn those things that could be said or might be said by ill-informed, unwise people trying to do harm. This is not just about giving people a capacity to act more freely with their speech; this is putting a responsibility on each and every one of us to stand up and condemn stupid things and hurtful things when they get said, not just in defence of that free speech. What makes the country stronger and more harmonious is not that people hide behind a law but that people step forward themselves as fair and decent-minded Australians and condemn stupid comments. That is what makes the country stronger, not black-and-white laws in legislation.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Whether or not this piece of legislation is successful today or tomorrow is yet to be seen, but my underlying premise is this. It is not that I think Australians are racist—not at all. I come from the position that I believe that Australians are fair minded, are decent, understand the great merit that multiculturalism has brought to our country and welcome new Australians to our country to start a new life, particularly those who are fleeing from political and religious persecution. The good things and the virtues about our country are the things that make me a free-speech advocate and wholeheartedly support these reforms.</span>

The words 'offend, insult, humiliate' will be removed from paragraph 18C(1)(a) and replaced by the word harass'. The word 'intimidate' will remain. The Bill will also introduce the 'the reasonable member of the Australian community' as the objective standard by which contravention of section 18C should be judged, rather than by the standard of a hypothetical representative member of a particular group.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Small">The law should provide protection from racial vilification. It should do so in a manner which is consistent with Australia's obligations under the Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Racial Discrimination (CERD). However, this protection needs to be consistent with the right to freedom of speech, which is fundamental to the strength and health of our liberal democracy. Effective protection against racial vilification need not curtail freedom of speech. However section 18C in its current form potentially does so, without providing any extra protection from racial vilification. As well, section 18C fails to protect against racial harassment—an essential element of protection against racial vilification.</span>

The people we can trust on this issue are very, very significant people who care about their country as much as senators in this Senate chamber—and I will come to that in a moment. As a triumph of parliamentary democracy, this is a good outcome. If the law changes, it falls on each and every one of us to stand up and condemn ignorant comments. These things are very important.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">If we do not want to trust senators in this place, who can we trust? When I was researching this issue back in 2013 and early 2014, I was pleasantly surprised to hear that it was Justice French, the immediately past High Court chief justice of our country, who supported reform. I was surprised to see that it was well-known leftist legal mind Julian Burnside QC who supported reform. As the debate developed in our community, others came to the argument as well, supporting the case for reform. I think what changed in the minds of ordinary Australians were two things. As much as the debate in this chamber and other places was important, two things changed the attitudes of ordinary Australians, took the issue out of the academic and theoretical sphere and brought it into their lived experience. That was the experience of the QUT students in Queensland and the experience of Bill Leak, the cartoonist for <span style="font-style:italic;">The Australian</span>. I hear from lots of people that this is not an important issue—that this is not an issue that people are talking about at their barbecues and their local pubs. I disagree. I do not believe that people are standing at pubs and barbecues talking about 18C. I do think that people are standing at barbecues and pubs talking about protecting their values, protecting their way of life and wanting to stop this political correctness that constantly seeps into everything we do in our country. That is what people talk about at barbecues. That is what people talk about at pubs, and 18C is the technical expression of that issue. So this is important; this is a live issue for Australians.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Let me just share with you what Justice French had to say about this important issue. He said—and it was noted in what was called the Bropho case of the former Human Rights and Equal Opportunity Commission: </span>

Feelings of offence and insult are not serious enough to justify restrictions on the human right to freedom of speech ... It is true that the terms, 'offence' and 'insult' have been interpreted so that they mean more than 'mere' offence and insult. It is arguable that judicial interpretation has saved these provisions from actually breaching the right to free speech. However, the law should mean what it says.

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Everywhere you turn in this debate, I would argue that the case for reform has got stronger and stronger and stronger. It has got stronger amongst indeed those at the highest levels of our legal profession. I would argue that across the community the case for reform has got stronger and stronger. Indeed the case of the QUT students and the cartoonist Bill Leak has added to that strength. I would also note that it is not true to say that opponents of reform are to be found in Australia's ethnic communities—that is not true. What is offensive is this idea that Australia's ethnic communities are homogenous in their view to free speech. I would argue that some of those people who have come to Australia as new Australians understand better than we do the importance of free speech and have probably shown much more courage than we ever will in standing up for free speech, in fighting tyranny in their own countries and now they come to a country with such great democratic values as ours, with such a strong parliamentary democracy. </span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">To suggest that people from ethnic communities do not understand the merit of free speech, I think, is offensive. You have only have to look at the record to find out what they say and you will discover that leaders of ethnic communities, members of ethnic communities, are divided, and why shouldn't they be? We are divided. Communities have different points of view—that is okay–but to argue that ethnic communities are united in their opposition is just not true. </span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Warren Mundine, prominent Indigenous man in our country, supports reform. Members of the Jewish community in our country support reform. Members of many other ethnic communities support reform. It might be harder to find their opinion, but it does not mean that they do not have an opinion and it does not mean that they have not had the opportunity to put their view on the public record. Again, that is why the parliamentary inquiry process has been so important, because it has given everyone an opportunity to put their view on the public record, and a body of evidence has emerged. </span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Like I said, I have spoken many times on this bill. I congratulate senators and members of the Parliamentary Joint Committee on Human Rights for the way that they conducted themselves during the inquiry. Whatever happens tonight, whatever happens tomorrow, there is a substantial body of evidence that says that reform is necessary, that reform can be done. I would argue that this has been the right process. I am proud to have been involved thus far, and of course whatever reforms we agree to tonight will be tested—will be tested in the Human Rights Commission, will be tested more broadly in the community—but we can have faith that Australians can live up to the very, very high expectations that we have enjoyed around the issue of free speech in our parliamentary democracy.</span>

I do so on the basis of recent polls, which have informed us that 80 per cent of Australians do not want any change; in fact they want the words to stay as they are.

There has been inadequate time for reporting the bill. It was introduced to the Senate on Wednesday, 27 March and referred to the Senate Legal and Constitutional Affairs Legislation Committee the next day for inquiry. But the government, through its numbers, shamefully worked to shut down a proper inquiry and instead demanded that the committee report on Tuesday, 28 March. Labor wanted a proper inquiry, not the sham agreed to by the government and some crossbenchers in this place, and we moved a more sensible and reasonable reporting time of 9 May, which would have allowed for proper consultation, but that was knocked off by the government, with the support of some of the crossbench.</span>

This is despite the availability of the Aboriginal Legal Service (ACT/NSW), who sought to be heard during the hearing. Government members of the committee denied the Aboriginal Legal Service an opportunity to speak. Why? What was the government afraid of? This is yet another disgraceful example of the arrogance and the out-of-touch nature of this Turnbull government.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">What is it that the government believe individuals do not have the freedom to express under the current act? They have never, ever been able to answer that question. The government has failed to provide any compelling arguments for either of the two proposed changes to section 18C as outlined in schedule 1 of the bill. Why is it that the Turnbull government wants to legitimise offence, insult and humiliation, all in the name of supposed 'free speech'? The only response we have heard from the Turnbull government is that they believe Australians who look different will not be attacked. The Prime Minister, his ministers and, indeed, the backbenchers—including in the last speech we heard here—try to pretend that all Australians are somehow are bigger than this. What arrogance! What absolute arrogance! It demonstrates just how out of touch and out of step the Prime Minister and indeed all members of the government are if they genuinely think that we do not have racism in this country and that racism is not on the rise.</span>

I thought I was beyond being shocked by what people said or did but, when Nova showed me the emails and social media posts that vilified her simply because of the colour of her skin, I was deeply, deeply shocked and very ashamed. The comments were appalling, they were disgraceful and they were uttered by fellow Australians. Sadly there were not just a few of them; there were many. Somehow the writers of this hate speech thought they were entitled to vilify Nova Peris simply because of the colour of her skin.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Let me put on the record in this parliament once again that I stand for free speech, but I do not stand for the right to offend, insult or humiliate. As a white Anglo-Saxon woman, I have never experienced racism, but nonetheless these proposed changes are personal for me. I have two grandchildren. As with most grandparents, they are the apple of my eye. Aidan is 18 years old. Physically he has brown skin and Asian features. Some time ago, I asked Aidan if he had ever been taunted because of his physical features, I was shocked when he answered, 'Yes, and not just once but many, many times.' That is what Aidan told me—'Many, many times,' he said. Then he named the taunts he had received, disgusting terms which I will not dignify by repeating them here in this chamber. They were words which were clearly offensive, insulting and humiliating. I will never understand why we as human beings are fearful of those who look different to the mainstream, who look different to me, and why we think it is okay to use such insulting terms. Aidan was born in Australia but has even been told to 'go back to where you come from'. His father, my son, also born in Australia but with a Polish last name. has been complimented on his 'good command of English', because he has a Polish last name.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">My granddaughter, Charlee, has learnt the lesson of racism at a very young age. When she was living in Geraldton, a regional town in the Mid West of Western Australia, she was about 11 years old, and we were out shopping together in Geraldton. We passed a particular shop, and Charlee pointed that shop out to me. She said she had visited that shop with her mum. Charlee is Kija. She said the shopkeeper had followed her and her mother around, watching them, thinking they might steal something. When I asked Charlee why the shopkeeper may have thought that, she responded by saying, 'Because I'm Aboriginal.' It is a shameful that 11-year-old Charlee has learnt that lesson at such a tender age. Charlee has learnt that the colour of her skin somehow makes her different to other people and causes some people to be suspicious of her</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Small">There is nothing wrong with freedom, particularly if you are from the ruling class. There is a hell of a lot wrong with freedom if you have to battle to experience it—if you have to fight for it. I was born before the 1967 referendum, when we as Aboriginal people were not even counted in the census of this country, when this government did not have any power to make laws for Aboriginal people because it was excluded by the crafters of our Constitution in 1901. The whole battle for recognition—for freedom to enjoy the basics of being a citizen —in this nation had to be fought for by black and white Australians: Jessie Street, Faith Bandler and many others.</span>

You have never had taxis drive past, pretending not to see you. You have never received hateful letters and emails because of your race or the colour of your skin. I really wish I could believe there are not any racists in Australia. But certainly my personal experience, and my family’s experience, informs me of the reality that I live in this country.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">On Tuesday, in this place, Senator Brandis made this extraordinary statement in relation to 18C when he said in part:</span>

Well, I say to Senator Brandis and others in here who think it is okay to remove those words—who somehow think we are live in this utopia where we all get along and no-one makes insulting remarks to anyone else—walk a day in the shoes of an Aboriginal or Torres Strait Islander person in this country. Walk a day in the shoes of someone from an ethnic community to get a real understanding of the meaning of persecution.</span>

                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">South Australia</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">17:01</span>):  It bothers me that I even have to speak today on such a confected problem. We are debating a bill that has, at its heart, a change that is simply not necessary, as our courts have proven time and time again. The government is proposing to amend section 18C of the Racial Discrimination Act 1975, to allow people to offend, insult and humiliate others on the basis of their race, religion or skin colour, because it thinks the current laws set the bar too low—that boggles the mind. How does this government feel it is appropriate to, in effect, sanction the public humiliation of another person? Instead, it wants to set the bar to what it believes is a more appropriate standard of harassment and intimidation.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">In the government's eyes, it is not enough that someone is made to feel like a lesser human and have their dignity and self-worth stripped away by insulting slurs and hateful words and actions—there has to be some higher level of fear and torment. Imagine how that plays out. Imagine being a new migrant, for instance, and being publically humiliated by a person spewing racial or religious hate, who verbally attacks you in front of your young children—children who see you as a hero. The sense of powerlessness and shame this creates would last a lifetime. Imagine the anger that would burn in you when you revisit that moment in your mind. Imagine how unwelcome it would make you feel in your new homeland.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Australia has always prided itself on its multicultural cohesiveness. We are a land built on migration where people of different nationalities, ethnicities and religions have come together to build a modern and peaceful nation. Underpinning this has been, in essence if not always in practice, a respect and tolerance for each other. The very same people who champion free speech and want to change 18C would no doubt also demand that migrants assimilate and take on Australian values. And yet, how can any vilified migrant do this when that vilification only serves to create a sense of exclusion that inhibits them from freely participating in community life? This pointless and mean-spirited attempt to diminish 18C sends the message that a cohesive multicultural nation is no longer important and that the relative harmony we enjoy is not worth protecting. It fails to recognise that free speech is not a hate-filled free-for-all. The message it sends is that it is okay to strip away civility and to insult, offend or humiliate another person without repercussions, and that anyone who thinks otherwise is politically correct or overly sensitive. Frankly, this can only ever be the view of someone who has never experienced vilification based on their race, religion or skin colour, and who is in the convenient position of never having had to seek the protections of 18C.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">What has been largely ignored in this debate is that exemptions in section 18D are a very broad and strong defence to claims brought before section 18C. This begs the question, in what ways have the courts, guided by the current laws, failed us? They have repeatedly shown that they do not tolerate vexatious claims. You cannot sue over hurt feelings. So, I ask again: how have the current laws failed us?</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">In his 2014 PEN essay on the freedom of speech and Australia's Racial Discrimination Act, the Race Discrimination Commissioner wrote:</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">Any debate should also be based on a sound understanding of how the Racial Discrimination Act in fact operates. There are numerous points of misunderstanding—for instance, the oft-made claims that racial vilification laws criminalise hate speech or involve a form of state censorship. The law as it currently exists involves neither of these things. Moreover, courts have interpreted the law only to apply to those acts that cause profound and serious effects, as distinct from hurt feelings.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">The case for changing the Racial Discrimination Act has not been made. There is no compelling evidence that the law has a chilling effect on freedom of expression in Australia. A weakening of racial hate speech laws may have the effect of emboldening a minority of Australians with bigoted views. To those who would champion a right to be a bigot, we should ask: must this supposed right outweigh a right to be free from the effects of bigotry?</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The Human Rights Legislation Amendment Bill 2017 also seeks to add the objective test of whether an act is reasonably likely to harass or intimidate a person, or group of persons, as assessed by 'a reasonable member of the Australian community'. It completely ignores that the courts have been applying the law according to a much more sensible objective standard, which is to assess the offending act in light of how reasonable members of the same community would feel, not some blokes down at the pub who might just think, 'Toughen up, mate.'</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The Human Rights Law Centre put it so eloquently in their recent submission to the Senate Legal and Constitutional Affairs Legislation Committee, where they said:</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">It is racial and ethnic minority groups that suffer the impacts of racism, not the Australian community as a whole. We cannot, and should not, expect a reasonable member of the Australian community, who has never had the distressing and degrading experience of being called a 'coon', a 'black—</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">and I won't say the word because it would be in breach of the standing orders—</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">a 'terrorist' or being told that 'Hitler should have finished you', to understand the impact of such statements and the fear and sense of exclusion they create.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Both the Law Council of Australia and the Human Rights Law Centre argue that the current test is an adequate one and changing it could have unintended consequences such as reinforcing prejudice, particularly against unpopular racial minorities.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">As I have said, the courts have shown that they will not entertain a case that is brought by an overly sensitive person or group. This has been amply demonstrated in the QUT case, where the Federal Court decided the three university students had no case to answer for their flippant comments and Facebook post, and that the Human Rights Commission should never have pursued it. What this highlighted for us, however, is that there are flaws in the system before cases even get to court. This is where we should look to change. My colleagues and I want to see strong reforms to the process because the process has, in effect, become the punishment. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Such reforms will go a very long way in dealing with concerns that have been expressed about 18C. It is important to also note in this debate that section 18C is not a new provision. It was inserted into the Racial Discrimination Act 1975 over 20 years ago, in 1995. This was in response to recommendations from major inquiries, including the national inquiry into racist violence and the Royal Commission into Aboriginal Deaths in Custody. These inquiries found that racial hatred and vilification can cause emotional and psychological harm to their targets and reinforce other forms of discrimination and exclusion. They found that seemingly low-level behaviour can soften the environment for more severe acts of harassment, intimidation or violence by effectively condoning such acts.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Since then, the courts have consistently interpreted sections 18C and 18D as maintaining a balance between freedom of speech and freedom from racial vilification. In various decisions, the courts have held that for conduct to be covered by section 18C, it must involve profound and serious effects not mere slights. The courts have also found that section 18C is an appropriate measure to implement Australia's obligations to prohibit racial hatred under the International Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Racial Discrimination and the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">As the Law Council of Australia president Fiona McLeod told ABC NewsRadio's breakfast program on 21 March this year: </span>

                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">The cases coming before the court have been decided by some of our most senior officers and they decided that the provisions and protections of the various sections; that's 18B, C and D of the Act read together, provide protections against the most profound and serious effects.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The parliament often responds to judgements of the courts that highlight a particular anomaly, flaw or inconsistency with the law. The native title amendment bill is an example of this process in action. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">In the case of 18C, the courts have not criticised the wording or said that they do not strike the right balance between freedom of speech and protection from racial vilification—far from it. When taking calls on this issue, some of my staff told me that members of the public would refer to the QUT case and the late, great Bill Leak as to why section 18C needs to be changed. What these callers are witnessing is a result of a flawed process not a flawed law. These cases should never have progressed as far as they did and we are pleased that this bill at least seeks to ensure that the commission's processes will be improved to ensure they are fair to all parties and their claims that have no merit cannot proceed to the courts. </span>

                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Fiona McLeod in the same interview with ABC NewsRadio said: </span>

                  <span class="HPS-Small">… the Human Rights Commission needs a mechanism so that it is able to deal with these disputes early, and we certainly support the strengthening of those provisions which let it, for example, decide that certain cases do not make the threshold of the current provision and to strike them out.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">To sum up our position, my colleagues and I believe a case has been made to change the Australian Human Rights Commission's complaints handling processes, but we cannot in good conscience support any changes to the wordings of section 18C. That is why we are moving an amendment to remove schedule 1 from the bill. As the law currently stands, 18C strikes the right balance between freedom of speech and protection from racial hatred. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I note the government has made further amendments to schedules 1 and 2 of the current bill. As we do not support any changes to section 18C, I can indicate that we will not be supporting the amendments listed on sheet HV208. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The amendments listed on HZ118, according to the supplementary explanatory memorandum, address technical issues in the bill to ensure that the government's policy intention in improving the commission's complaints handling processes can be properly implemented and do not impose a disproportionate regulatory or administrative burden on the commission. These amendments will also ensure that complainants, respondents and the commission itself have a clear understanding of their rights and obligations throughout the complaints handling process. They are a welcome improvement but more work certainly needs to be done. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The Law Council of Australia believes that not all the issues have been addressed, and we remain concerned about two key issues. Firstly, the transitional arrangements outlined in the government's amendment apply to complaints made prior to the commencement of the relevant provisions. This is a change from what was originally proposed. It would have an impact on approximately 2,000 complaints that are currently before the commission and would require an unnecessary diversion of the commission's resources. We support the original transitional and application provisions contained in the bill and urge the government to reconsider its approach.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Finally, item 57 of the bill, relating to costs, should be removed. The court already has a discretion as to costs and can have regard to offers to settle. This amendment is unnecessary and should be removed.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We also have other concerns that are not addressed by this bill or the new amendments. My colleague Senator Xenophon asked Professor Gillian Triggs at the Legal and Constitutional Affairs Legislation Committee inquiry into this bill about any confidentiality requirements when complaints are before the commission. We are concerned that there may be cases where a complaint is made, particularly when it is frivolous or vexatious, and the complainant then publicly names the respondent, or vice versa, which would lead to added and unnecessary distress. Professor Triggs took this question on notice and the commission provided further information, which we appreciated. The commission stated that there is currently no obligation on parties not to disclose the fact that a complaint has been made or the details of the complaint. In general, increased publicity tends to make it more difficult for the parties to achieve a conciliated outcome through the commission's processes. The commission considered that there was a potential benefit in Senator Xenophon's proposal that confidentiality be maintained up until the end of the conciliation stage. This is a proposal that we want to explore in more detail but, unfortunately, time is not something we have a lot of this week.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">As I said at the outset, the Nick Xenophon Team has been consistent in calling for reforms to the complaints-handling process. The Senate should not rush this legislation through for the sake of political convenience. We need to make sure we get this right.</span>

                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Western Australia</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">17:16</span>):  Je suis Charlie—I am Charlie. Those words, as we know, resonated around the world on and after 7 January 2015, when two brothers, Said and Cherif Kouachi, burst into the offices of <span style="font-style:italic;">Charlie Hebdo</span>, a satirical magazine based in Paris, and murdered 12 people and shot to injure 11 others simply because they were exercising their right to freedom of speech. Such was the hatred of those two brothers towards satirical cartoonists who were exercising a right that has long been established in France and elsewhere that it led to those cartoonists being murdered or injured. Indeed, our own President Parry represented the parliament and the people of Australia at the memorial service that occurred in Paris soon after that event. The world was outraged. Everybody went around with T-shirts with those words 'Je suis Charlie'—I am Charlie. Yet, all too quickly, many people who confected that particular view have had cause to change it in relation to the debate that is in front of us at the moment.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Go back into history, because if we ignore or forget the lessons of history we are bound to repeat them. I do not know if it was the French historian and philosopher Voltaire, who lived between 1694 and 1778, who wrote these words, which we all know, but let's give him the credit for them: 'I disapprove of what you say, but I will defend to the death your right to say it.' We can go forward to the first President of the United States of America, George Washington, and I quote his comment:</span>
                </p>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Come forward to the present day and let's examine some of the comments of people in the current sphere on their view on 18C and whether it needs amendment. Mr David Marr, a person not given to the right of politics, has spoken on this matter. I will quote three of his statements. In the first he says:</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">… in a free and energetic society, giving offence is necessary.</span>

                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Elsewhere he has said:</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">Offence and insults are the everyday reality of free discourse.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">That resonates with Voltaire and Washington. In the third of his quotes that I will refer to he says:</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I will now go to comments of Professor James Spigelman, a former Chief Justice of the Supreme Court of New South Wales and, until recently, chairman of the Australian Broadcasting Corporation. He has said:</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">I am not aware of any international human rights instrument, or national anti-discrimination statute in another liberal democracy, that extends to conduct which is merely offensive.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Those are the words of the ex-Chief Justice of the Supreme Court of New South Wales. In the same debate he also said:</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">The freedom to offend is an integral component of freedom of speech. There is no right not to be offended.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I go now to the comments of former senator Joe Bullock, whose only offence was to say to his then leader, Mr Shorten, 'If you want to continue to support same-sex marriage, then, unfortunately, I will have to pack my bags.' I still feel very angry about that fact today. This is what Senator Bullock said in a speech in this place:</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">To be tolerant of your views I do not need to pretend that you are just as right as I am but rather to accept that you have a perfect right to hold a view I believe to be wrong, even if I find your view offensive.</span>

                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I go, if I may, to Father Frank Brennan. Again, a Jesuit priest would normally be regarded as one of a different political persuasion to that of my own and, of course, he is the son of a past Chief Justice of the High Court of Australia. He said this on 13 March this year. You cannot be much more current than that. He said:</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">I have since been convinced that a provision like 18C could be designed to target racial vilification, leaving offensive insults beyond the reach of the law in a robust democracy committed to freedom of speech.</span>

                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The last I wish to quote from—again, they are not a person you would think is normally on our side of the political divide—is the lawyer Julian Burnside QC. We know him to be an asylum seeker advocate and lawyer. He said that people should not be prosecuted for offending a group of people on racial grounds. He made the observation that existing racial discrimination laws go too far by making it an offence to upset people. That is according to Julian Burnside. He said:</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">The mere fact that you insult or offend someone probably should not, of itself, give rise to legal liability.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">

                  <span class="HPS-Small">My personal view is that 18C probably reached a bit far so a bit of fine-tuning would probably be OK.</span>
                </p>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Other people who have spoken in this space are none other than Human Rights Commissioner, Professor Gillian Triggs, who has recommended that major changes be undertaken, and indeed the Law Reform Commission.</span>

                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I want to draw the attention of the chamber and those who might be listening to some definitions because they are critically important to the dialogue associated with this debate. The definition of 'intimidate' is to frighten, to threaten or to severely overawe. That of 'harass' is to torment, to persistently and continually disturb and annoy. One could not have anything but sympathy for the comments of others in this place drawing attention to the unacceptable behaviours of people towards others. I refer to Senator Lines' comments particularly. But I put to you that what Senator Lines was referring to were acts associated with attempts to intimidate or harass, and the strength of this proposed legislation is the introduction of 'harass' for the first time. It should always have been there—to torment or persistently disturb or annoy. What is the absolutely essential element of those two in contrast to the other three words? It is this: they are aimed to stop a person going about their normal business. If you think back to the comments that we heard, particularly from my colleague Senator Lines, you can see that those sorts of references and others, which should remain, are there to stop a person going about their normal business. Let me, if I may, contrast those with definitions of the others. 'Offend': to displease or to cause anger. 'Insult': be offensive and indicate to somebody their worthlessness. 'Humiliate': to suggest an indignity to a person; to interfere with their self-respect or to embarrass them. In contrast to the first two, which interfere with the normal activities of a person going about their business, I put to the chamber that the other three relate to hurt feelings. I have no doubt at all that is quite possible.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I have made the comment at different times—and it was levelled at me as a kid—that I am the grandson of bog Irish peasant farmers, and I am. The interesting thing is: in the mind of the person levelling that allegation, do they have any idea as to whether I felt humiliated, insulted or offended? How can they know what my response would be to the fact that both my maternal grandfather and my maternal grandmother came from, respectively, Galway and Tipperary? Mr Acting Deputy President Bernardi, you would know that, far from being offended, insulted or humiliated, I am absolutely overjoyed. I and members of my family, when we went to the north-eastern wheat belt area of Yelbeni recently, placed a plaque on a piece of granite, recognising the centenary of my grandfather taking up that land. He was the first farmer in that district. My extended family and I recounted all of the areas where their many grandchildren and now great-grandchildren have found themselves in professions around the world, around Australia and around Western Australia, contributing to the wellbeing of this place. Yet the words of that person, in calling me the grandson of a bog Irish peasant farmer, may well have been offensive, insulting or humiliating, but in no way did it stop me going about my daily business.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I want to make brief reference to one other term that is used in this place. There has been great argument from others regarding Senator Brandis, the Leader of the Government in the Senate, the Attorney-General, in relation to the term 'bigot'. I will place on the record what the definition of 'bigot' is. It is a person who is utterly intolerant of any differing creed, belief or opinion or prejudice. All 75 of us spend plenty of time in this place and I would venture the opinion that all of us, or certainly most of us, could have reasonably levelled at us the fact that we have been utterly intolerant of the view of another or their opinion or their belief. We see it in question time every single day. That is what a bigot is, and it should be recorded to be so.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Reference has been made to the events relating to the Queensland University of Technology students. I do not intend to prosecute that much further, except to say, as my colleague Senator Griff said, it was eventually sorted out in the courts. You yourself, when you were contributing to this debate, Acting Deputy President Bernardi, from your experience involved in the court process—and there are some in this place who have had it—know that it is very much more complex, time-consuming, emotional, draining and costly than just saying, 'It was sorted out in the courts.' In fact, I saw the comment of one journalist, 'Nothing to report here.' There was plenty to report here all right, and it was a scandalous example of an abrogation of responsibility by the Human Rights Commission and its president. Indeed, thank the Lord that competent pro bono legal advice was given to some of those students.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I refer to Mr Bill Leak's cartoon. I want to comment not so much of the content of the cartoon but on the wonderful commentary given by a past national president of the Australian Labor Party, Mr Warren Mundine, himself an Aboriginal man. Mundine made the point very strongly that those who condemned Bill Leak should themselves be the ones condemned, because, as Mundine eloquently pointed out in the media, Leak was simply trying to point out what those of us who have some association with different communities, including remote communities, around this country know to be the case and deal with on a daily basis. We see the prosecution of Mr Andrew Bolt. Julian Burnside QC made the point that the plaintiffs could well have brought a libel charge against Bolt, but, no, it was worked out through 18C.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Senator Griff has pointed out his support, and that of his colleagues, for the reform to the complaints-handling process of the Human Rights Commission. I do not want to spend much more of the chamber's time, except to say that it is the case—I agree with Senator Griff—that it is an abuse of process. It is a sad dereliction in the current precepts and handling processes of the commission that either the Queensland University of Technology case or that of Mr Bill Leak were ever prosecuted to the extent they were and for the time they were. We had the regrettable circumstance of two members of the Aboriginal Legal Service of Western Australia going to Fitzroy Crossing, having a chat with a couple of Aboriginal gentlemen, putting to them the fact that this was offensive and getting them to make a formal complaint. Only afterwards, once they realised what it was they had been asked to involve themselves in, did they reverse their decision. In this place I have challenged the Aboriginal Legal Service of Western Australia to explain the actions of those two people and to defend them. Unless I am mistaken, to this moment there has been no attempt to defend or to explain what one may reasonably call entrapment.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I conclude simply with the observation that in a robust economy, in a robust democracy, in the place where robust thoughts are argued out, it is perfectly reasonable for this to take place. I conclude simply, in my poor French, with the words, 'Je suis Bill Leak.'</span>

It is a question repeated ad nauseam by Labor, the Greens and the journalists who barrack for them. Today I will say some things that violate 18C and that may get no protection from 18D. I am happy to repeat them outside of parliament so that we can find out. 18C is being defended by self-appointed representatives of Armenian, Hellenic, Indian, Chinese, Vietnamese, Japanese, Jewish, Lebanese Muslim and Arab groups. These largely self-appointed representatives do not subscribe to Australian values. They are encouraging the groups they purport to represent to reject the path of integration and assimilation that has served so many migrants well in the past. They are encouraging the groups they purport to represent to favour and promote the repressive policies of the places they came from.</span>

We have representatives of Chinese Australians, or at least of those Chinese Australians who swell with pride about Chinese authoritarianism, wanting to suppress anti-Chinese sentiment. We have representatives of Japanese Australians wanting to suppress all reminders of comfort women. We have representatives of Turkish Australians wanting to suppress claims of Turkish genocide, and representatives of Armenian Australians wanting to suppress the Turkish responses to their claims of genocide. We have self-appointed representatives of Jewish Australians wanting to suppress Holocaust denialism.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Labor and the Greens are doing the bidding of these self-appointed representatives in the hope of votes from the various immigrant groups, and in the process they are selling out Western values. We need to be very clear with the self-appointed representatives of immigrant groups. Australia maintains the Western Judeo-Christian civilisation, the finest civilisation of all time. We hold dear the values and institutions fostered originally in Britain and so successfully transplanted here over the past 200 years. We subscribe to equality before the law, so we are all bound by these values and institutions, whether we are descendants of those who came here tens of thousands of years ago, or we just landed here. We will prevent and punish crime, and report on it in our free press, even when the crime is disproportionately carried out by recent Sudanese migrants, second generation Lebanese Muslims, or Aborigines. We will remove your children from you if you neglect them or abuse them, even if that neglect and abuse is a consequence of your Aboriginal ancestors being dispossessed centuries ago, and subsequent mistreatment of you and your ancestors. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We believe in equality of the sexes, so you are not free to mutilate your daughter's genitals, arrange her marriage in her childhood, have sex with your wife irrespective of her willingness, or get automatic custody of your children if your marriage collapses. We believe in freedom from arbitrary arrest, an independent judiciary and the right to a fair trial, and we oppose the death penalty. That is why we will not ratify an extradition treaty with Communist China, or any other backward, repressive regime. We are a meritocracy and we hold our government to account for its use of taxpayers' funds—which is why newspaper articles should be free to mock affirmative action policies for pale-skinned Australians with some Aboriginal heritage, without those articles being deemed unlawful.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">What I have just said would have offended certain people on the basis of their race, colour or national or ethnic origin, so what I have just said would violate 18C. In answer to the question often posed by Labor and the Greens, these are the things that cannot be said because of 18C, except if you enjoy parliamentary privilege or are willing to pay a court-ordered penalty. What I have said may also have 'harassed' certain people, particularly if I mentioned the names of the self-appointed representatives I was referring to. Indeed, such comments may well be thought of as 'harassment' by the 'ordinary reasonable person'—so what I have said could still violate 18C even if we use the word 'harass', and even if we adopt an 'ordinary reasonable person' test, as the government's bill proposes. Finally, a court might not consider my comments to be reasonable or made in good faith, in which case I would get no protection from 18D.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The government's The Human Rights Legislation Amendment Bill 2017 is an improvement on the status quo, and I support it. But if you support Western civilisation, the best civilisation we have ever had, 18C must go.</span>

                    <a href="DYU" type="MemberSpeech">
                      <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Senator FAWCETT</span>
                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">South Australia</span>—<span class="HPS-MinisterialTitles">Deputy Government Whip in the Senate</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">17:40</span>):  I rise to speak on the Human Rights Legislation Amendment Bill, because this is an important issue. I made some comments in my maiden speech in this place on what are those things about democracy that are worth defending. It is not so much the benefits; it is about those principles, those things, that underpin a plural liberal secular democracy. Freedom of speech and thought, freedom of association and all those things are part of it, and that is why this is important. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This debate is problematic. The examples that are often given by those who wish to keep 18C as it is often go to the personal interactions between people. There have been not only in the chamber here but also in committee hearings some very distressing stories told about the personal interactions between people when people have been harassed or intimidated on the basis of their race. There is no-one in this place who would find that acceptable. I think it is fair to say, and let me be clear, nobody wants to see someone harassed on the basis of the colour of their skin. But nor should anyone here want to see a cartoonist harassed by a government authority for expressing a view. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The difference between those two cases is that on one hand you have a fairly clear, directed, personal attack on somebody that is intimidating or harassing, bearing in mind the definition of 'harassment' in this bill means that it can be a one-off event and it is not the circular argument that some people have pointed to with other definitions of 'harassment'. So the government is actually strengthening the provision against that individual case. As I said, to be clear, nobody supports that sort of harassment. The problem with the other case, the more general public statement, is that there is no clear threshold, no predictor that somebody can use, as to what that threshold of offence is. It is instructional when we look at this broader type of statement to look at the Bill Leak case because it is a fantastic exemplar of this in action. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Submissions to the inquiry on 18C and how it should be interpreted have said, 'Look you cannot have the reasonable person test because you have not walked in that person's shoes, you do not understand what they have gone through.' That is a fair argument from one perspective, but in this case we saw some people—Senator Back just referred to this—from the Aboriginal Legal Service going out and encouraging people, saying, 'Don't you find that offensive; we should take some action over this.' So that is one threshold where people have taken offence. But then you have people like Mr Mundine, who wrote a very good article in the press which highlighted his background, highlighted the fact that he was one of the Indigenous population group and his background was not a privileged one. He had experienced all kinds of actions, and yet he, as a member of that people group, made the very clear statement that some people see racism where there is none—referring to Bill Leak's cartoon. That identifies a very clear difference between that personal, one-on-one incident of harassment and intimidation and a case where somebody is expressing a view, and there is no clear threshold at the moment, no predictor of the threshold, for me to understand or for Bill Leak to have understood, 'Am I going to get the Aboriginal Legal Service's response or am I going to get Warren Mundine's response?'</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">That is not an acceptable place for our society to be in, because it means that the intent, the purpose, of an expression is judged lawful or unlawful on the unquantifiable response of even one other individual who may choose to say, 'I take offence at that.' We saw that in the case of the QUT students. We see it often where difficult subjects come up—subjects that people feel personally. They may well have had experiences in their past that are painful and disturbing. They will choose to respond in certain ways.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">But, if one of the fundamental parts of our democracy is that people can speak about difficult topics, we need to allow for the fact that not everybody will have the training of a lawyer and not everyone will have the opportunity to research case history before exercising that right. In fact, Justice Kirby in his judgement in the decision of the High Court in 2004 in Coleman v Power said:</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">In Australia, we tolerate robust public expression of opinions because it is part of our freedom and inherent in the constitutional system of representative democracy. That system requires freedom of communication. It belongs to the obsessive, the emotional and the inarticulate as it does the logical, the cerebral and the restrained.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Those are not my words. That is Justice Kirby. It highlights the fact that, when people enter into this debate around ideas, they may not have the background to understand all the jurisprudence around what has or has not been accepted in the past for 18C—the high legal standard that we are constantly told is applied for 18C.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Part of the problem—as we saw for the QUT case, for Mr Leak, for names that are undisclosed but the reports from the Human Rights Commission identify, and for many hundreds of other people, who have ended up paying in the order of hundreds of thousands, nearly a million, dollars in these processes—is the process. When somebody says, 'I'm offended,' and goes to the Human Rights Commission, the process itself is debilitating and punishing even if things do not get to the court. So we need to look at how we word this piece of legislation that protects the individuals in all those cases we have heard. The government are strengthening this so that we do protect people from that harassment, or that intimidation, but we provide a platform, an ability, for people who want to contribute to the public debate in good faith and not be hauled up before a state authority because one person or a group of people, in the words of Warren Mundine, see racism where it is not.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">It is important that we resolve this now, because, as we have seen in the media just in the last week, there have already been discussions by the opposition about how this potentially should apply not just to the Racial Discrimination Act; this 18C construct should apply more broadly, whether it be in religion, sexuality or other areas. When we look at the reluctance of sections of our community now, in the absence of any law, to be tolerant of views that differ from their own, I shudder to think of the consequences if this were wrapped up in a law and a process that is similar to section 18C of the Racial Discrimination Act.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Let us take another very current example, the debate on a Bible Society video where people were drinking a Coopers beer. I have watched that. I know both of the gentleman concerned. The debate was civil. It was informed. You could even say it was innocuous, except that in the current climate it was challenging. It was challenging because, despite the rhetoric of the progressive left that anyone who does not agree with their view is a hateful bigot, it demonstrated that people of good character and goodwill can have differing points of view and discuss it in a civil way. It said that both of those people have worth. Their views have a place in our society. Our society, if it is to function as a plural, liberal, secular democracy, must allow people to discuss and debate ideas in that format.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">But what happened? We saw outrage on social media. We saw people boycotting the products of Coopers, who were by and large the innocent party in this whole affair. Damage was done to people, in this case a company, by people who were intolerant of ideas that differed from theirs. So if we already see, under section 18C of the Racial Discrimination Act, people seeing racism where there is none, and in cases like this we see people seeing bigotry and hatred where there is demonstrably none, then I shudder to think of adding the weight of law to that.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Likewise the case of Mark Allaby, an employee of IBM, who was singled out by activists who questioned why he should be allowed to work for a firm that was an avowed supporter of diversity, equity and marriage equality—and that is fine; they are quite entitled to do that if they wish. This person was singled out on the basis of his association with a group that was looking to raise up and train articulate contributors to our society. If you look at the Lachlan Macquarie Institute and you look at what they are about, they are about training people to participate in an articulate and informed way in the debates of our society and in our culture, not to dominate it, not to impose their views on others, but to contribute to see where their world view has a place.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">If you look at the people who are on the board of that institute, you do not see people who you would characterise in any negative terms. There are people there who for a number of years have been committed to relieving global poverty, who are involved in microfinancing initiatives for people in developing countries. We see people who are concerned about housing availability for those least able to obtain housing in our community. We see people who are committed to preventing modern slavery and the trafficking of people. We see people who have served their country in the Defence Force for over 30 years. These are quality people, who have contributed to our society, to the poor, to the global good, yet from the way they are labelled by the Left you would assume that they are the worst of the worst people and wonder why would IBM want one of them on its board. In fact, the person who started that diatribe against him, which I understand has resulted in Mr Allaby having to stand down from the board of the Lachlan Macquarie Institute, said that this is not about freedom of religion—he can have his belief; he can go to church. But if you look at article 23 of the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights, you will see the non-derogable writer that person is not only to have his belief or his faith or his conscientious thought but, unless there is a competing right, which in this case there is not, he is also free to express it, to manifest it, to teach it. Article 22 guarantees the freedom of association, so Mr Allaby is quite free, and we should be backing him to the hilt, about his freedom of association, particularly with a group where other board members have such high standards and records of ethical contribution to our society and to the population of the world more broadly.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I think it is important that we come to the statement that was issued just recently about our shared values on multiculturalism. This is something issued by the government, but the opposition has lent its support and said that it is a positive document. Under the heading 'Freedom' it says:</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">We support freedom of thought, speech, religion, enterprise, and association.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Those detractors of Mr Allaby should realise that he has a right to have his faith, to associate with a group that is a positive group developing people's character and ability to contribute to our society. That right should never be undermined. We need national leadership from this parliament and, I would argue, even in the business place to support people like him. Rather than remaining silent, I would like to see the CEOs of those companies out supporting these fundamental rights. They write letters on other topics; you can argue whether or not they should be, but they do, and they have a right to do that.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">IBM's equity and diversity statement says:</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Small">A key element in our workforce diversity programs is IBM’s long-standing commitment to equal opportunity.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">It goes on to say:</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">IBMers around the world work in an environment where diversity—including diversity of thought—is the norm and innovation can flourish.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">What the activists are demanding, and what it appears IBM have acquiesced to, is to say, 'No, we will have a workplace with no diversity of thought. We will not allow people to have any opinion on this topic'—and perhaps other topics—'that deviates from the norm that the company has established.' That is not diversity. If they want diversity and the innovation that they say will flourish through diversity they actually need to live that out. All corporates do. All members of this place should recognise that diversity is important. I have stood here before and put forward my view on contentious topics in a polite, respectful way, with no hatred, but I have been called a hater and a bigot in this place. That to my mind says that people do not actually understand what diversity and equality mean. They do not understand the very nature of a liberal, plural, secular democracy, where people should be free to do what our new statement on multiculturalism says:</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">We support freedom of thought, speech, religion, enterprise, and association.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">So to my mind, national leadership on this is required, and the government is seeking to do that through these reforms. The reforms provide that leadership in terms of the wording of amended section 18C to strengthen the case that are talked about at the start, where individuals are harassed or intimidated one on one. We are strengthening that, because currently there is no protection for harassment. When this all started back in 1995, that was the recommendation, that section 18C of the Racial Discrimination Act should prevent harassment. So the government is strengthening this provision by putting that in. But we are also strengthening the freedom of thought and speech in this nation, particularly of those areas where people are expressing a view, and we are recognising the fact that even within a subpopulation group you will get the diversity of people like the Aboriginal legal service of WA and Mr Warren Mundine. Who in this place is to judge which of those two is right? If Mr Mundine says others see racism where there is none but he sees none, why should we say he is wrong? Without that predictable threshold, we need to change that wording.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">For a similar reason, we also need to change the basis upon which the judgement is made. That is why the government is looking at 'the reasonable person', which is common across pretty much all of our other statutes, in that we look at what a reasonable member of the Australian population would think. That is why juries are chosen at random to be brought in, so we have a cross-section of ordinary Australians who come in to apply their judgement to a certain conduct and evidence that goes before them.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Lastly, because the process itself has often been the punishment for people, this legislation also looks at changing the process of making complaints at the Human Rights Commission. This is an important issue, because we need to protect the individuals. As I said at the outset, let me be clear: nobody in this place should—or, I would argue, does—support that kind of harassment or intimidation of an individual. But likewise nobody in this place, the centre of Australia's democracy, should support situations where we cannot discuss freely and put forward views in society without a government-funded authority being used as a threat to shut down that discussion. This government is taking national leadership in this space. I would encourage corporates and other people to take leadership to support those people within their workplace to have true diversity, freedom of speech and association.</span>

                      <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Senator SINGH</span>
                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Tasmania</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">18:00</span>):  I really cannot believe we are here in 2017 debating again the issue of watering down protections against race hate speech in this country. But, yes, here we are again, thanks to a certain group within the Liberal Party who are absolutely obsessed with trying to water down the protections that we currently have provided in section 18C of the Racial Discrimination Act. There was a reprieve some years ago, and we thought that the government had seen the error of its ways. It dumped changes that it wanted to make at that time which were basically very similar to what we have before us now—changes to water down those protections against race hate speech. But unfortunately they have raised their ugly heads again. A certain group within the Liberal Party has lobbied the Prime Minister hard to make him backflip and bring this legislation on. So unfortunately we are back here again. And look at the day that they chose to do it. It was actually on Harmony Day, the day that we celebrate that everyone belongs. That is the day that the government chose to announce that it would be bringing forward legislation to water down the very essence that ensures that everyone belongs, the underpinning of everyone belonging, and that is the race hate laws in Australia. What an absolute disgrace.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Who would have thought it? If you had been asked which one, out of Tony Abbott and Malcolm Turnbull, would bring forward legislation to water down these laws, you would have thought that perhaps Tony Abbott would have been the one to do it. You would never have thought that Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull would be doing such a thing—someone whom people once referred to as a small 'l' liberal, not one of the cabal to bring these laws on. And that is what it is: a particular group within the Liberal Party who are absolutely obsessed with this issue. They do not care for the fact that out there in the street no-one is talking about this. No-one is coming up to me—or to any member of this Senate, I do not think—and saying, 'When are you going to water down race hate laws in this country? When are you going to do something about section 18C?' That is not what people are talking about on the street.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">What people on the street are asking is, 'When are we going to have, legislated in the Australian parliament, marriage equality?' That is what people are asking. People are asking, 'When is the government going to act on climate change? When is the government going to address underemployment in this country and inequality in this country?' These are the issues that people on the street are actually talking about. If those Liberals who are obsessed with this issue would get out of this bubble in Canberra and actually talk to some real people about what their issues and concerns are, they would soon realise that nowhere on that list is 'Let's reform and water down section 18C of the Racial Discrimination Act'. And yet here we are. I look forward to the crossbench supporting Labor to stop this government obsession with allowing bigots to have that right to be bigots—because that is what this is about.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">An interesting poll came out this week—a Fairfax Ipsos poll—which showed very clearly, from about 1,400 voters, that 78 per cent of Australians believe it should be unlawful to offend, insult or humiliate someone on the basis of their race or ethnicity. Seventy-six per cent of respondents who intend to vote for the coalition in fact said they support retaining the words 'offend, insult, humiliate'. So, even if you do not want to listen to the average person on the street, what about listening to some of your own supporters who do not want this law changed? Deputy Prime Minister Barnaby Joyce himself made it clear that this does not resonate as an issue with mainstream voters. It is not passing the pub test, as one would say. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">So why are we here? It was 2014 that we were debating this last time, under an Abbott prime ministership. It is 2017, and we are back doing it again. It is like we are in some kind of groundhog day on the issue. Just as Labor won the fight to protect Australia's laws against racial discrimination in 2014, we will do it again. We still do not have an answer, though, to the question that the Prime Minister refuses to answer, and that is: what does he want people to be able to say that they cannot say now? What is it that those Liberals who want this law changed so desperately want to say that they cannot say now under the current law? One thing we know very clearly about this law is that it is not just about people's feelings getting hurt. The bar is higher than that, and the government knows that. It knows it very clearly. Therefore, what is it that they really want to say to people of different race that they cannot currently say? The court has interpreted section 18C so that it only applies to 'profound and serious effects, not to be likened to mere slights'. There is the bar. The bar is there. So why does the government want to repeal those three words and water them down, replacing them with one word, 'harass'? It does not make sense. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I say to this government: haven't Aboriginal people in this country gone through enough already; do you really need to do this? Haven't ethnic groups and new migrants all done enough to try and fit in to this country, to the Australian way of life; do they really deserve this? These are the people that you are attacking by bringing this ridiculous piece of legislation back into this place. This is a complete failure of Malcolm Turnbull's leadership, as if we did not have other examples of that failure already. Even Tony Abbott—even Tony Abbott—stood up to the IPA faction of the Liberal Party and dropped his idea to change the law, back in 2014. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I hope that the government learns from this. I hope that, after the votes are cast in this place tonight, the government learns from this and drops its ridiculous obsession with wanting to give the green light to racists, bigots and anyone else who feels that the current laws do not give them enough freedom to say whatever it is that they want to say. And I ask them: what is that? What is it that you feel so constrained about, living in Australia, that you cannot say to people of different races? What is it? </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The law as it stands works fine. The polls that have been conducted say that the public think that the law works fine. No-one on the street is talking about having these laws changed. This is just a ridiculous waste of the Senate's time, and it shows that the government is completely out of touch with Australian values, with the Australian idea of what it means to live in a multicultural country and with what is important to Australians. The sooner the government wakes up and realises that, the better. The sooner this government is voted out of office—even better.</span>

                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Victoria</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">18:10</span>):  This debate is not happening in a vacuum. It is not something confined to the chambers of this parliament, inside the Beltway and Parliament House. It is happening in an environment in Australia where racist hate-speak is on the rise, and where people of colour, of diverse multicultural backgrounds cannot walk down the street without feeling threatened. It is happening in an environment where there has been an increase in people being insulted, humiliated, offended, harassed and intimidated—all of those things. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I want to share with you a meeting that I had last Sunday. It was with a Muslim women's group who were having a morning tea to bring their community together. The name of their event and their theme for the morning was 'Working towards unity in today's hostile political climate', because they recognise what has changed for them as Muslim Australians over the last couple of years. They told me some horrific stories. They mostly wanted to celebrate their diversity. They mostly wanted to come together and focus on the positives, and a positive way forward. But it was inevitable that they shared what had been happening to them, their experiences—being yelled at on the streets, or abused on public transport, just for being identifiably Muslim; women wearing hijabs being told, 'Go back to where you came from,' and being vilified just because of who they are. They told me of a woman wearing a niqab, which is the face covering that shows only the eyes, driving a car with the window wound down, and having a cup of hot coffee thrown at her, scalding her face. They told me of another woman, also a niqabi, walking down the street with her two-year-old in a pram and having the pram kicked over. They told me of their young children coming home and saying, 'Why do people always say bad things about Muslims? Why can't they say good things about us? We are good people, aren't we?' And they are good people. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This is the climate in which this debate is occurring, and any weakening of our Racial Discrimination Act is going to give the green light—it is already giving the green light—to the unleashing of more racism. This weakening that is going on has consequences, and there is no doubt that replacing 'offend', 'insult' and 'humiliate' in the Racial Discrimination Act with 'harassing or intimidating' is giving people licence to say more. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Even if the legislation, once it finally goes to court hearings, does not change the situation on the street, it is giving people that sense, 'We can now be more racist than we felt we could be before.' It is encouraging those racist attitudes. It is encouraging that sense of difference. It is encouraging people to feel that difference and to feel that it is okay to offend people. The argument being put by the government is that not being able to 'offend', 'insult' or 'humiliate' is an attack on free speech. Simply put, it is not.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The argument that is being put up that this is an attack on free speech—that people should be able to offend and insult and humiliate and just not be able to harass or intimidate—is a complete straw man. I think almost everybody in this chamber would have agreed with the arguments put by Senator Fawcett before in defence of free speech, but free speech is not under attack with the current wording of the Racial Discrimination Act. Senator Leyonhjelm said that what he said would have violated section 18C, and he was going to go outside and say it and see whether it would have got through.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Firstly, under the existing provisions of 18C, it is not just somebody taking offence that would enable a successful case. Justice Kiefel, who is now the Chief Justice of the High Court, in the <span style="font-style:italic;">Cairns Post</span> case said that in order to be successful those words had to have 'profound and serious effects, not to be likened to mere slights'. So it is not just, 'Oh, I'm offended,' and therefore people cannot say that, because they are going to be prosecuted in a court case. No, it has to be something that is causing 'profound and serious effects, not to be likened to mere slights'.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The other thing that we never hear from the government is the provisions of section 18D. Sections 18C and 18D operate together. So, for example, everything that Senator Leyonhjelm said in his contribution earlier on absolutely would have been covered by the provisions of 18D. I want to read out the provisions of 18D in their entirety because I think people need to be reminded that we have 18C that says we are not allowed to 'offend', 'insult' or 'humiliate', but 18D says:</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Clearly, 18D covers off any reasonable expression. It is not just a case of offending somebody and then being hauled up before the courts.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The case that is being used as a cause celebre is that of Bill Leak. It is absolutely clear that the 18D defence would have cleared Bill Leak of any prosecution. It was 'the performance, exhibition or distribution of an artistic work', first of all. It was making a fair comment in a matter of public interest. Section 18D, a hundred times over, would have let Bill Leak off. It would not have been a case that would have held up. In fact, we have been told that Gillian Triggs, of the Human Rights Commission, has said that they wanted an 18D defence to be put forward as a defence because that would have meant, very clearly, that the whole case would have been able to be very quickly dismissed.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Finally, in having this debate tonight, I really urge the government and I really urge the crossbench to be thinking about the impacts that this debate is having on people who are just trying to live their lives in a dignified way, free of harassment. I ask people to be listening to the voices of multicultural Australia, listening to the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people and listening to the peak bodies representing our diverse Australian community. As a parliament we do not need to capitulate to the far right of the government backbench. We have a Prime Minister who has capitulated to his far right, but we as a parliament do not need to do that.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We need to be listening to our diverse society. We need to be hearing what they are saying, hearing about the racist attacks that are on the rise in Australia. We need to be doing everything we can to put them to bed and to say that we want to celebrate multicultural Australia. We want to be reducing racism. We want people to be able to live their lives free of insults, offence, humiliation and harassment, to be able to get on with their lives, to feel valued and to feel at one as part of the Australian community. These proposed changes to the Racial Discrimination Act are the exact opposite of what we need to be doing. We need to be encouraging our diversity, not attacking it.</span>

The bill seeks to change the wording of section 18C of the Racial Discrimination Act 1975 by removing the words 'offend', insult' and 'humiliate' and replacing them with 'harass'. Let me be clear that the changes in this bill will weaken protection for Australians against racial hate speech. We will not support this or any other change to 18C.

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Earlier this week, Senator Brandis again referred to the Turnbull government's changes as a 'strengthening' of 18C. I know I am not the only one scratching my head, wondering how on earth the law will be strengthened by removing 'insult', 'offend' and 'humiliate' from section 18C of the Racial Discrimination Act. Our Prime Minister says, 'This is the language that will do the job,' because, apparently, 'offend', 'insult' and 'humiliate' do not do the job.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This out-of-touch government also claims that these changes will allow more freedom of speech. Let me make one thing clear: there is no freedom of speech crisis here in Australia—none whatsoever. What I really want to know is what the Prime Minister wants people to be able to say that they cannot now under the current law. It is a very simple question but not one that has yet been answered. No matter which way you look at the government's changes, they guarantee there will be more racist hate speech in Australia than there is now. After all, how can it be about freedom of speech unless it is going to allow more things to be said?</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I want to turn my attention to the Senate inquiry. I actually was not part of that inquiry, but, if the government were really trying to strengthen the act, Aboriginal Legal Service would not have been barred from the Senate inquiry into the proposed changes last Friday. The exclusion of the Aboriginal Legal Service from Friday's hearings into the proposed changes to section 18C was disgusting and speaks volumes about this government. The government have exposed themselves as complete and utter hypocrites on the subject of free speech. Instead of standing with multicultural Australia, they have sided with bigots.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The proposal to weaken section 18C has been rejected nationally and by our multicultural communities. Replacing the words 'offend' and 'insult' with 'harass' is not harmless change. On Sky News on Tuesday night Andrew Bolt stated that a person would have to be insulted on the basis of their race five times before they would fall under the government's definition of 'harassment'. Does the Prime Minister agree with Mr Bolt's definition of harassment under the proposed changes to section 18C? If he does not, what is his own definition? The wordsmith on the other side of this place, Senator Brandis, has said that 'harass' means 'to bother'. How is this not weakening of the laws?</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This may not be a real issue for those opposite, but it is a very real issue for international students who are being heckled and abused on their way home, the woman on the train or the bus being racially abused as she rides home from work or the taxi driver who was racially abused from the back seat by his passenger because of the colour of his skin. It is easy for those on the opposite side to belittle a protection they never need. It is easy to dismiss a hurt they have never felt.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I personally was very fortunate in my upbringing in Tasmania because I never experienced racism at all. My father survived 3½ years as a prisoner of the Japanese in the Second World War. He survived the Burma Railway and Changi, and he taught us children to be tolerant. He in no way had any racist undertones toward anyone. That is how I was brought up. Unfortunately, when I got married—my husband was born in Germany—our children, who are white, everyday kids experienced firsthand the racist comments in relation to their heritage and their father's heritage. To go to school and be told 'Your father murders people,' 'Your father kills people,' 'Why does he do that?' 'Because he's a Nazi,' is something we should not tolerate in this country. We should not tolerate it now and we certainly should not be weakening the laws to allow people to feel that they can say what they want and that there are no ramifications for what they say.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We were all elected here to be the voice of people who need our help. Words hurt, and this is a very real issue for people who are not getting their voices heard by those on the opposite side. Each and every passing week, this government prove themselves to be more out of touch with the people they represent. It is the one thing they are good at. You cannot make this sort of stuff up. Last Tuesday was the International Day for the Elimination of Racial Discrimination, and in every school it was Harmony Day, but at Parliament House it was the day the government announced it wanted to change the law to give permission for more racist hate speech. Then, to add to the government's absurdity over this, we had Senator Brandis saying that these changes to 18C defended the free speech that the Anzacs fought for. I do not believe that is an accurate reflection at all.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Now we are standing here because the government is seeking to rush through these changes without any proper consultation. I ask again: how out of touch does this government have to get? Former Prime Minister John Howard has even joined the debate, strongly supporting the government's planned amendments. Mr Howard said that these changes would reverse more than two decades of what he called 'pointless Labor legislation'. Just last week Mr Christopher Pyne was on radio, saying that section 18C had been twisted and no longer had any credibility. Let me ask you: how is a law that halts racial offence, insults and humiliation pointless? What does that say about this government? What does that say to young people? What does it say to the people who make up this country? What does it say to the multicultural communities in this country?</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The government's changes will weaken protection against racial hate speech and racial discrimination—protection that has served Australians well for more than 20 years. We won the fight to protect Australia's laws against racial discrimination in 2014 and we will do it again. I think the government is just obsessed with 18C, and it is so unnecessary and so unfounded. Even the Racial Discrimination Commissioner said there is absolutely no case to make changes to prohibition of speech that insults, offends, humiliates or intimidates a person based on race. How on earth is this country going to be improved by more racial hatred? The answer is very simple: it is not—not today and certainly not tomorrow.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Mr Turnbull says we have a freedom of speech crisis in this country, but we do not. What we do have is a health crisis, childcare reforms which need to be fixed and 1.13 million people underemployed. We have an aged-care workforce crisis. These are the real issues that people in the community are concerned about. They are concerned about the cuts to penalty rates. They are concerned about the cuts to family payments. These are the issues people are talking about.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The government's changes to section 18C will not create new jobs or put an extra nurse in the ward or help any pensioners. They will not save penalty rates or provide the people of Tasmania with new infrastructure, and they certainly will not improve the lives of Tasmanian families. The Liberal Party's obsession with this shows everyone just how out of touch they really are. The Prime Minister can talk about free speech and political correctness all he likes, but the proposed changes to 18C have nothing to do with either of these things. The fact that I am standing here today, fighting to stop the government's changes that weaken protection against racial hate speech, is all you need to know about this government. How can they come to the conclusion that it would be a good idea to remove 'insult', 'offend' and 'humiliate' from the law? I do not know and I do not understand. What sort of government says that racial humiliation, offence and insults are okay, but harassment is not okay? Racial hate speech is real, it is demoralising and it hurts, and the last thing we should do is change the laws to allow more of it</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Labor will oppose any attempts to weaken protection for Australians against racial hate speech. We will not support any changes to section 18C of this bill as it stands, and I urge those on the crossbench to vote against these changes.</span>

                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Northern Territory</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">18:32</span>):  I rise to speak against the Human Rights Legislation Amendment Bill 2017. We have much more important business before the Senate. We have families being hit by cuts to penalty rates and there is the debacle of the social security system, yet we are spending all this time working out how we can allow people to make offensive, insulting and humiliating comments, without any comeback. I heard people here today say this debate is just about allowing them to have an opinion. Of course, everyone has a right to an opinion. This is not what we are debating here, and to pretend that we are is just disingenuous.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This debate is about being allowed to say hateful, hurtful comments based on another person's race. Is your opinion that I am somehow lesser than you because of my race, that I and my culture are not as deserving of respect as yours? This debate is about saying you have no right to take offence when people make these comments. But people have every right to take offence at this. You talk about freedoms and rights. Yes, people do have a right to take offence when hurtful, hateful comments are made to them because of their race. Australia is not colourblind, but in this bill we want to turn a blind eye to racism.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Racism is Australia's Achilles heel, our weak spot, our touchy national blister. I will not stand here and be lectured about racism and prejudice. I know what racism is and what impact it has and what personal damage it can cause. You only have to ask Adam Goodes or Nicky Winmar. Ask Michael Long or Senator Pat Dodson or former Senator Nova Peris or any of the multicultural leaders who were here in the parliament this week, consistently lobbying against this bill. They know what racism is. We live it every single day.</span>

                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">You cannot know what it is like to live with racism until it is a part of your everyday reality. Only then do you really know. I have heard so many members in this place express that it is something they do not experience. I certainly do not like standing here talking about racism, and I wish we were past that, but we are not. In my travels both as a member of parliament and as a journalist I have witnessed acts of racism against others. I have witnessed verbal assaults and seen a black woman refused a key to the toilets and told hurtful and hateful things about her because of the colour of her skin. I have seen a football team that wins a grand final for their south Arnhem Land team, only to be told they cannot celebrate in a local nearby pub because of the colour of their skin. I have received and continue to receive at various times racist comments and behaviour as a result of the colour of my skin. </span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">From the get-go, white colonialists regarded first nations people as inferior beings and thought it was okay to denigrate us and take our lands and, in many cases, take our lives. This month, 112 years ago, Jack Patten was born, a man regarded as one of the founders of modern Aboriginal political action. He spent his life fighting for equal rights and opportunities for Aboriginal people. He spent his life believing in a better Australia, a more united Australia, a harmonious Australia and a just Australia. He fought against all the injustices, and this included the right not to be vilified and regarded as lesser because of race. In a speech delivered at the 1938 Day of Mourning and protest, Jack Patten said:</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We only need to read government sanctioned reports like the <span style="font-style:italic;">Bringing them home</span> report, released 20 years ago this year, which tells story after story of the suffering of children removed from their families because of the colour of their skin and often that left behind an even deeper and tragic legacy of intergenerational trauma for them and their descendants. Sadly, this type of racist view still exists today. It festers on in social media and in institutionalised racism. We heard recent calls from congress for a broader look at such racism in our health and prison systems.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">When I first stood in the Senate and addressed each of you in my maiden speech I touched on the real harm that racism and racist commentary can do. We need only be reminded of the hateful and hurtful commentary on race that ended the stellar career of AFL hero and Swans legend Adam Goodes. Then there is the work of Michael Long, who back in 1995 make a stand against racial abuse after an on-field incident. He is one of the pioneers behind the racial abuse code adopted by the AFL in the 1990s. Are we asking to weaken this? Is it infringing on the rights of footballers? Are they just expressing an opinion? Of course we are not.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I wish I could believe that there are no racists in Australia, but certainly my personal experience, my family's experience and that of those around me informs my reality. Being the target of racist, hateful comments and actions is deeply hurtful and deeply distressing and causes great harm. It causes insult, causes offence and causes humiliation. From a cultural perspective, to be incredibly humiliated can bring even more tragic circumstances. I know this as a fact. I know this because this is how I feel when I am subject to these comments. And it is not just personal; institutional racism, as I said earlier, is very much alive and well. It may not be as visible, but it is there and people feel it.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">In my time as a journalist my work was never constrained or diminished by section 18C. I worked for 20 years as a journalist across Australia. As a former journalist and now senator, I am a firm supporter of free speech, but free speech is not hate speech. Former Prime Minister Paul Keating said in his Redfern speech:</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Small">I think what we need to do is open our hearts a bit. All of us. Perhaps when we recognise what we have in common we will see the things which must be done—the practical things.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">As I said, I do not really want to be talking about the hateful reality of racism. We have spent so much unnecessary time on trying to remove a very important piece of legislation so unnecessarily. I want to be here talking about the many things that must be done—the work that needs to be done—to close the gap, to build a strong economy in north Australia, to ensure every Australian child has the opportunity to grow up safe, healthy and with access to quality education and to ensure that women have a right to safety across this beautiful country of ours. So let us open our hearts just a bit and think about what these changes to section 18C mean and the really deep potential impact on the lives of Australians.</span>

We all know that in this place any law can always be changed and improved. The changes to section 18C of the Racial Discrimination Act 1975 proposed by the government weaken the protections for Australians against racial hate speech and racial discrimination. Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander organisations and people have had no opportunity to comment upon the changes proposed in the bill. For reasons beyond my understanding, the Aboriginal Legal Service was not allowed to appear at last Friday's Senate Legal and Constitutional Affairs Legislation Committee hearing on the draft bill and the spokesperson for FECCA was not allowed to finish their opening statement by the chair of the Senate committee. But this should not be too surprising, given that these changes were insultingly announced on Harmony Day, the International Day for the Elimination of Racial Discrimination.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The Aboriginal Legal Service and other organisations may have contributed to the Parliamentary Joint Committee on Human Rights inquiry report, but that is not the point. They were denied an opportunity to comment on the text of the new bill and the inclusion of 'harass' instead of 'insult, offend, humiliate'. They were denied the opportunity to comment on the introduction of 'a reasonable member of the Australian community' as the objective standard for determining a breach of the section.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This bill is not about freedom of speech; this bill is a display of contempt for Aboriginal Australians and members of multicultural communities. The Bolt, QUT and Leak matters all involved Aboriginal people, so Aboriginal organisations and individuals should have been consulted. Their exclusion from the process is disgraceful.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Section 18C, as it is currently drafted, is not 'an inappropriate mechanism of political censorship used to stop people from expressing opinion', as noted by Senator Brandis in his second reading speech. There is certainly scope to review the complaints process through the Australian Human Rights Commission, provided there are not additional delays, costs and impediments to justice. But the wording of 18C has served Australians well for more than 20 years. Section 18C is read in conjunction with section 18D. It ensures that freedom of speech is not unduly restricted. Neither the QUT case nor the Leak case provides a sound basis for amending section 18C. These are just two cases in a catalogue of 18C cases spanning over 20 years.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">If we consider the Bolt case, it will be recalled that the articles he wrote were held to be discriminatory because they 'contained errors of fact, distortions of the truth and inflammatory and provocative language'. When the articles were originally published, the public sentiments directed at Aboriginal people were hateful and vulgar. One of Bolt's readers responded to his article by writing in the online comments section: 'If only there were nerve gas chambers back in 1788.' Andrew Bolt's latest claim is that a person will have to be insulted on the basis of their race five times before they would fall under the government's definition of harassment. We know that in another case the court has interpreted 18C so that it only applies to 'profound and serious effects, not to be likened to mere slights'. Amending section 18C will not promote freedom of speech—it will promote racial hate speech and racial discrimination.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Seeking to change section 18C of the Racial Discrimination Act illustrates that the Australian government is not genuinely committed to Closing the Gap. In the survey 'Localities Embracing and Accepting Diversity (LEAD) Program 2010-2011' it was noted that: 'The link between poor physical health and mental health and self-reported perceptions or experiences of racism has been well documented. Racist attacks can cause injury and psychological distress. The targets of racism are at greater risk of developing a range of mental health problems such as anxiety and depression, which are contributing factors to the health gap between Australia's First Peoples and other Australians.'</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">These are the real impacts of racism. If the new test of racial hate speech and racial discrimination is to be put to the hypothetical 'reasonable member of the Australian community', how do we gauge the input of fellow Australians from diverse cultures and backgrounds? The people who are pushing to amend section 18C have absolutely no idea about the toll of racism. Senator Hanson spoke of an incident of reverse racism yesterday and the incident is indeed unfortunate. But it does not illustrate that she understands and has felt the devastating damage and cost of sustained lifelong racism. Senator Hanson, and the other senators obsessed with amending 18C, have never known what it is like to grow up as 'other' in an exclusive society.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Senator Hanson also says that it will come down to the pub test. What bar will that be in—the white bar or the black bar? This type of unlegislated segregation still exists around Australia. Everyday Australians are not talking about changes to 18C at the pub this weekend. They are talking about when work will pick up again, how hard it is to buy a house in their town or suburb, or the future of their children—or they may be just talking about the footy or the cricket. This ideological campaign of certain members of the government and crossbench has no value to everyday Australians, whether they be Indigenous Australians, migrants or descendants of the First Fleet. This campaign is bereft of any tangible benefits because Australians already have freedom of speech in this country.</span>

I have said before in this chamber that we are at the end of the second hundred-years war, and this second hundred-years war is the war against tyranny. It started in the Great War with an expansionist Germany. It continued through fascism arising in Germany and continued with communism as it enslaved the peoples of Russia and Eastern Europe. Our fight against tyranny paused in 1989 with the fall of the Berlin Wall, when the freedoms that were fought for were given to the people who were formerly under the yoke of the Soviet oppressors. It erupted again, sadly, in New York in 2001, when terrorists attacked the World Trade Center.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The components of this hundred-years war against tyranny that I want to talk about tonight I spoke about in my maiden speech. The first concerns governments restricting freedom of speech and freedom of association and how leftists delegitimise all views other than their own. How we see 18C operate is a classic demonstration of the consequences of the government back in 1995 bringing in changes to the Racial Discrimination Act that have had the effect of shutting down freedom of speech. We also see with the 18C debate that anyone who believes in freedom of speech is attacked, marginalised and portrayed as some hard-right fighter by those on the left. That is disappointing because, when it comes to this hundred-years war against tyranny, the principles which have underpinned this fight have been freedom of speech and freedom of association.</span>

One was a journalist—let's try and stop a journalist from expressing their views. Andrew Bolt probably is not my biggest fan.

                    </a>  It disappoints me because I actually do like Andrew. Andrew, I am sorry that you are cranky with me at the moment. How Andrew was treated with 18C was a disgrace. It was his case that first shone a light onto how 18C was going to be used by the left to delegitimise those with different views and stop them from expressing them. A journalist—that is who 18C has been used against. Then we had some students from Queensland—some normal university students who went to the Queensland University of Technology, a university that I am actually an alumnus of. One of them, it is alleged, made a throwaway comment, though it has never been proved that this person did make this comment. What happened to these students? Their lives have all but been destroyed by how 18C was used against them. It was used to turn this into a modern day witch-hunt against them. But, of course, the poor students did not even know about 18C and the Human Rights Commission, this Stasi-like Star Chamber. A so-called investigation went on for months, if not years, into their alleged conduct. These poor students have had to face excessive legal bills and their careers have probably been destroyed by the Human Rights Commission and by the fact that someone was able to make a complaint against them under 18c because this person felt offended by something that one of them may or may not have said. That is the problem with 18C: it stops people from expressing their views.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The third person I want to talk about was a cartoonist for one of our newspapers—an artist, someone who painted and drew. 18C was used against Bill Leak, an artist who, sadly, passed away. What type of society or country are we becoming when a journalist, some students and an artist are being dragged before a Stasi-like Star Chamber, not because they have committed hate crimes but because someone out there may have felt offended by something they said?</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">It is offensive on so many levels that the left are using freedom of speech to effectively criminalise those people with whom they disagree. This is the challenge that is facing Australia at the moment. We have seen a revitalised and revised left who are very excited by Jeremy Corbyn because he is doing so well in the United Kingdom and very excited by Bernie Sanders because he did so well in America, and what they understand is that they can use political correctness to stop those who have different views from expressing them. But it gets worse than that: we have seen the President of the Australian Council of Trade Unions say that she is going to treat the law like a smorgasbord—she will only obey the laws that she agrees with, so any laws that she disagrees with she will quite happily go and break.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Australia is based on certain pillars—freedom of speech, freedom of association and the rule of law. We are seeing—with this attack on those freedoms, through the use of 18C or how the modern union movement see the law not as something to be obeyed but as something to be disobeyed—how the modern Left think, and that is a real problem. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We have already seen this week a member of the Labor Party saying that they wish to see 18C extended—even though it is to do with racial discrimination—to include a similar provision that deals with religion. Suddenly, you cannot have discussions about religion in case people are offended. Is this modern multicultural Australia where we cannot talk about religion, where we cannot talk about issues that impact on modern society? Because the true test of a tolerant, inclusive society that believes in freedom of speech is how freedom of speech is treated and, by that, the Left only believe in freedom of speech with which they agree. Views that they disagree with, they do not believe should be expressed and they do not believe in that freedom of speech. So, if we allow the Left to continue with this tirade against freedoms, we will end up on that slippery slope—I think we are on it at the moment—where people are afraid to speak their views, and that is a problem and that is dangerous for Australia.      </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">No-one supports racism, and it is offensive of the leftists, who snigger and are snide, to imply that, because we believe in freedom of speech, somehow we are de facto racists or supporters of racism. That is incredibly offensive. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">It is those of us who believe in freedom of speech who understand that, when people express views that may be racist, the best way to deal with it is not by using the police to arrest people and lock them up because they have expressed views with which you disagree. The best way, if you are upset that someone has said something that you are offended by, is to call them out. The problem with 18C and this legislation is that the Left presume that all Australians are a bunch of bigots, a bunch of redneck racists and that only the Left—the Labor Party and the Greens—can protect Australians from themselves. If it weren't for them, there would be lynch mobs running around this country hanging people off lampposts, which is incredibly offensive to those of us who believe in freedom of speech. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">If someone does say something racist, you call them out on it. You do the classic Australian thing: you go, 'Hang on. Don't say that. That's racist.' And you will find that that person will stop saying that. But, if we go down the path of 18C where we have a Stasi-like Star Chamber where journalists, artists and students are dragged before, effectively, secret inquiries determining whether someone could have been offended by a comment that someone may have made, is this modern Australia? </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">It is important that, when we come to freedom of speech, we consider that of course there are defences. If I go back to my rusty old days as a quite average law student, I think it was Lord Denning who said that freedom of speech is limited in terms of a person shouting out—the man on the Clapham omnibus—'Fire! in a crowded theatre. If people feel they may be libelled, there are mechanisms through the courts that people can take. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The changes that we are proposing actually strengthen the provisions of the Racial Discrimination Act, because we are concerned that the subjective test of being offended is being used to stop people from expressing their points of views. We want to change that test and shift it from what a subjective member of a particular class of persons may feel to what an objective member of the Australian community may feel. This is so important because this shows the difference between the Left and the Right.      </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We believe in common sense, common decency and the common purpose of the Australian people. We understand that, when it comes to a test of when someone has said something that may be racially tinged, shifting from a test based on the subjective view of being offended to an objective view is a better way, a safer way and a more reasonable way to make sure that those who engage in racist conduct are properly judged. That is not how it is at the moment where 18C is used as a de facto police force to stop journalists, artists and university students from expressing points of view.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We think the changes that we are proposing to section 18C of the Racial Discrimination Act, which are to insert certain words and take out other words, will actually strengthen the act. But, as importantly, we also believe that the complaint-handling processes of the Human Rights Commission certainly need looking at. How the Human Rights Commission has operated is a concern to those of us who believe in the rule of law, which is probably only those of us on this side of the chamber. It is allowed to act as a Stasi-like star chamber to drag people in and to have investigations that go for months, if not years, and people's lives are all but destroyed by the actions of an unelected body that has in it a bunch of—let me be blunt—faceless bureaucrats or, in the alternative, attention-seeking bureaucrats who are using the Human Rights Commission as a vehicle to push their own view of what modern Australia should look like.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We on this side believe that the rule of law and natural justice were absent from, in particular, the treatment of those students—who were, I think from memory, just teenagers—by this body. I do not think the President of the Human Rights Commission has ever said sorry to these students. If it were not for these students being able to have some very able lawyers in Brisbane offering to help them pro bono to fight this insidious case that was brought against them, these poor students would probably have had to settle and sign all sorts of agreements because of the pressure that was put on them not only from a mental health perspective but also from financial impacts that were put upon them. Other students did settle for $5,000, and this shows how the Human Rights Commission was being used as some sort of fancy automatic teller machine in which complainants were able, because they were offended, to take a complaint to the Human Rights Commission and say that they were offended because someone said something that made them upset and they should get some money for it. That is wrong. It is wrong that students, an artist and a journalist were treated in such a manner by such a body because a section of an act of this parliament allowed this to happen.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">What we are doing here is strengthening the provisions of 18C that concern people who may have been harassed or intimidated by racial vilification. But, as importantly, we are making sure that freedom of speech flies strong in Australia, because there is an attack from the left on freedom of speech and freedom of association in Australia. There is an attack from these leftist elites who believe that the Australian people do not have the foresight, the common sense or the thoughtfulness to make decisions on their own in relation to such matters and that government knows best, but especially a Stasi-like, Star Chamber element of government which can call people into windowless rooms and accuse them of the most heinous crimes based on the fact that someone is merely offended. This is Australia in 2017, and now is the time that we must make a stand for freedom of speech and freedom of association and defend the rule of law.</span>

                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">

                    <a href="247871" type="MemberSpeech">
                      <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Senator O'SULLIVAN</span>
                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Queensland</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">19:12</span>):  I too want to make a contribution to the debate on the Human Rights Legislation Amendment Bill 2017. I must admit at the outset, though, that I am one of those Australians who would say to you that, except for the fact that I am in this place and this debate is taking place here, my mind has not been occupied with this debate over my cornflakes or in the circle of people that I move in. I had over 100 guests at my home last weekend, as I celebrated my 35th birthday! Whilst we spoke about many things, including matters of politics, the question of 18C did not dominate any of the conversations. It is only as a result of it being elevated here in this place in a political sense that I have been caused to think through the issue.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">My first experience with the question of free speech was in or about 1985, when I had the privilege of spending nine months in the United States, four of which were at the FBI Academy in Quantico, south of Washington, where I was occupied with looking at the issue of serial offenders on behalf of the police forces of Australia. In the course of that, I came across my first experience with an organisation called NAMBLA, the North American Man/Boy Love Association, which was a public group who occupied offices in both Washington and New York. They were funded, obviously, by demophiles and paedophiles. Through their right to exercise free speech, they were able to operate with impunity to advocate for sexual relationships between adults and children who were in puberty—so we are talking about young men. Indeed, they also made the case where young women were concerned. They were promoting that when a youth turns 10, 11 or 12—in that sort of time zone—they should be allowed to have carnal relations with an adult or another individual of an age not specified.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I have to tell you that, as a young fellow from Queensland, whilst I had not lived a sheltered life—I had by then been a detective for almost seven years—I found it abhorrent, so much so that I did a speech. International students were invited to do a speech in the auditorium on Wednesday nights before the movie. There were about 800 seats in the auditorium, and they were always occupied. I still have a copy of that speech where I spoke about freedom of speech. As far as I was concerned, I did not think that it extended to the NAMBLA organisation. As you might appreciate, the speech was provocative. Many of my fellow students at the academy decided to share their views with me, most of them very strongly in favour of freedom of speech, notwithstanding that they recognised the abhorrent nature of this particular organisation.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">That was the first occasion in my life where I turned my mind to the subject of free speech. I came to understand this principle that I can violently disagree with almost everything that someone has to say, yet we in a free society have an obligation to fight for the right for them to say it in the first instance. I get the freedom-of-speech thing.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I have to say that, as I grew up and in my life's experiences generally—except for exceptions as a young student and the juvenile behaviour of some with their language—I have not been exposed heavily to events of racism, notwithstanding that I was an active police officer for 15 or 16 years. I suspect that has much to do with the fact that most of my service was in country and remote parts of my home state of Queensland. I have never lived in the city. I have always lived in regional parts of my home state and country areas. I have been largely associated with communities and with societies and active economies that have to do with rural affairs.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I had a lot of friends as I grew up who were young Aboriginal men. I married a girl from Barcaldine, where there is quite a significant Aboriginal population. In the many, many dozens of occasions that I was out there I had the privilege of meeting and becoming friends with many of the friends of my father-in-law. They were Aboriginal men with whom he had been droving and shearing—and I imagine that was your experience too, Senator Williams—over a long period of time. There was often banter. It was banter that would, I think, attract the attention of the existing legislation prima facie, but it was not banter that offended. It is the subjective nature. I have often been referred to as fat and ugly. It has been frequent. Due to the fact that I am fat and ugly, it was difficult for me to take offence to the notation, but there may be others who would.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">What attracted me, as I considered the circumstances of these changes in the legislation, was this subjective test. No matter what else we might think about these changes being proposed by our government, we are going to at least transition to a more objective test, the test of reasonableness, which is a word not foreign to the judicial system. It is used as a standard to validate in criminal cases. Here is an area where for 16 years I had an obligation to present evidence to courts to prove beyond reasonable doubt any fact that I wanted to rely upon as an element of a charge of a prosecution, so I am very familiar with this question of 'reasonable'.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">That goes to the very heart of why we have juries with 12 people. The courts will educate them in situ on what this term 'reasonable' means. The standard is, at least in our country, that all 12 of them have to agree after they have each individually—separately from each other—applied their test of reasonableness. It is not just a case that seven find that a reasonable proposition and five do not; all 12 of them have to find that. This process, whilst not perfect, has served this nation and its criminal justice system well, and indeed it is in most Western societies. It is a system that we inherited from the mother country, and it still applies there.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">There is a lovely old saying that an empty Coke bottle to one person is an empty Coke bottle, but to the other person it is 5c. That is what subjectivity does to somebody. There is no room for that, as far as I am concerned, in a judicial system, in this case.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Imagine if we were to get a bit sensitive in this place. There would be complaints between the hours of 2 pm and 3 pm most days. I think that, on an active day when I am on my game, there could be 30 to 50 complaints lodged about me, and I am not one of the more active offenders.</span>
                </p>

                      <span class="HPS-MemberContinuation">Senator O'SULLIVAN:</span>
                    </a>  No, I am quite conservative. Sometimes, Senator Williams, I do get a bit excited, I will admit, but there are others. So you could leave here after question time with a couple of hundred complaints under this act, if we were to deal with 'insult and offend', and apply a subjective test.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The thing that did move me towards these changes—there have been a couple of fairly prominent cases mentioned, and I will be at risk of repeating some of the observations that have been made—was the Cindy Prior case, with the three young students from QUT. Without going to the substantive allegations, which on face value seem to me, even though I have said I have limited exposure to racism, to have been on the extremely low end of the scale, even in my assessment of things. What we saw was that the process in itself became a punishment. Not only that, the process offended the principles of natural justice. These people were under investigation. There were active things happening about them, that were to lead to them finding themselves in a civil suit, and they were not even advised. What makes it even more insidious is that some of the activities were funded by the state. Some of these activities were activities of the Human Rights Commission, which is funded by this very place. I could not think of anything more offensive than that.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">When they did become engaged and became aware—I heard Senator McGrath mention that they were represented on a pro bono basis. I have seen estimates from people who think that, even in their circumstances, they would have been confronted with legal fees of about $10,000. I must admit, when I first read that I thought it was light on. I am yet to have an engagement with a lawyer for sub $10,000, I can tell you, and I have needed them in some fairly minor circumstances myself. Let us add this up. If these three students had not had pro bono representation there is a cost of $30,000 to somebody, perhaps even the state—it is state versus the state if someone has attracted legal aid and the Human Rights Commission is on the other side. That is like punching yourself, to be honest. Then these young people, I understand, settled for $5,000. So we are now at $45,000. This is not just about the money, but this story really shows how unreasonable the process is, how impotent the process is—in fact I think the word 'silly' can be applied to it.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I have had my time at estimates with the Human Rights Commission. By jiminy, that is like trying to pull a hair out of your ear with a pair of canvas garden gloves on. You cannot get any information out of that mob. Only the good Lord knows how much they would have spent on the process, but it would not have been cheap. So I think we are well over $100,000 where some students commented on what they saw as evidence of segregation. Indeed, I was astonished to find there are these segregated areas where you need to declare, in this case, your ethnicity, your nationality or that you are Indigenous before you can enter into the space. That place used to be a bar that was reversed. They could not walk in there now. We could not walk in there. This is just stupidity on skates. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I am not going to go over the Bill Leak and Andrew Bolt cases, but I think it was right for those who hold a passion in this place to visit this issue and to revisit it. There have been some people—Mr Acting Deputy President Bernardi, you are one of them—who have championed in this place for a considerable amount of time.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I heard a contribution from one in the Labor Party talking about groundhog day, about how members of our side of the parliament have persisted in this to bring this to something, to bring this to a test, to bring this to a vote in this place. Sometimes in this place I feel like I am in a parallel universe. I was here not three days ago listening to a debate where these people were supporting the head of the ACTU, who said, 'Protest! Be active! Activate yourself and go against laws you do not agree with. Continue! Get the right to vote for women. Get the right for negro citizens in the United States to join us in a bar or on the bus. Fight for it! Continue to fight!' If as a legislator you do not have the courage to continue to fight and test the question around important issues such as this, you should pack your bags and go home. I think part of Senator McGrath's message was that there are people in this place—I could name them, alphabetically—who really fire up in protest when a statement is made, an idea is advanced, a debate is had or a question is tested and they do not like the potential answer. By jiminy, it gets their bloody hackles up. That is where some of my best fun comes. I know exactly what button to push on some of these people, and they will light up like a Christmas tree.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I think that the Leak case, the QUT case and the Andrew Bolt case have magnified the interest in this matter. Without breaching the confidentiality of our joint party room, I have heard passionate arguments on both sides of this question. We have members who live in communities where a high number of ethnic people live, and they hold a strong view about this.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I could talk for a long time on this subject, now that I have taken interest in it, but let me close by saying this. These changes are going to mean that there needs to be active behaviour—not a throwaway line, not a sledge on a football field, not a schoolyard tussle between two kids where some unfortunate statements are made; these changes create a need for activity—for you to be exposed to prosecution under this legislation. The legislation also deals with the process, which is important. I said earlier that the process itself was a punishment. If you were one of those students, it has taken 18 months of your life and will cause reputational damage long after you have left your university. Thirty years later, when your name comes up in conversation, you will not be remembered for your intellect, your power as an athlete, your student politics behaviour or your contributions to the newsletter; you will be remembered as one of the people who was prosecuted on those flimsy circumstances. I think this legislation is important, now that I have had time to consider it. It is legislation I can recommend that my colleagues support in this place.</span>

                      <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Senator RYAN</span>
                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Victoria</span>—<span class="HPS-MinisterialTitles">Special Minister of State and Minister Assisting the Prime Minister for Cabinet</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">19:32</span>):  It is a privilege to be able to make a short contribution to this debate on the Human Rights Legislation Amendment Bill 2017. I do not often speak on legislation that I am not carrying or that is outside the portfolio I represent, but I have spoken on this particular issue on a number of occasions in this chamber as it has arisen over the last few years. It is an issue strongly felt by me and by many of my colleagues. I will not repeat what a number of my colleagues have gone through earlier this evening with respect to specific examples, but there are some issues and some perspectives I would like to highlight.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I have long said that I am a first amendment type of person. I am not necessarily someone who is in favour of a bill of rights, but I have always said that I would not have a problem if there were a constitutional restriction on parliament passing laws abridging freedom of speech. A liberal democracy depends on the free flow of ideas. A liberal democracy depends on that being sometimes ferocious, sometimes unpleasant, sometimes difficult, but the flow and debate are critical to achieving some of the changes that opponents of this particular bill today are actually lauding in their speeches. Speech in a liberal democracy cannot be the product of a licence by the state. We have an inherited tradition in this country—founded following the revolution in England and the changes of the 18th century—that says that speech is free unless there is an overwhelming reason for the government to legislate or regulate against it. My colleague Senator McGrath earlier referred to the famous example of not being able to shout, 'Fire,' in a crowded theatre. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">But underpinning the arguments put forward by those opposite who seek to license speech—and, when they were in government, as I will highlight, they floated proposals to license speech and proposals to regulate the media in a way unprecedented in this country, outside wartime—is the philosophy that somehow it is up to this parliament to grant citizens the right to what they can and cannot say, to define acceptability. Where there is an immediate risk to someone, where there is a threat of violence to another citizen, where there is a threat to the safety of our citizens, no-one disagrees with that. But this law, as it stands at the moment, goes much further. I am surprised that the parties opposite, including the Greens—and some of their predecessors in the WA chapter of their party opposed this particular legislation in 1995 and indeed predicted some of the concerns that history since then has shown were true—now are so vehement in their support for a law that has proven itself to be flawed.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The last time this was debated in this chamber, there was an argument put that changing section 18C—and the changes put forward in this bill—somehow represented the grant of the right to be a bigot. I say to those opposite and those concerned about racism in Australia: look at our history. Our great, overwhelming success in establishing the world's most successful multicultural country happened, in the main, before this law came onto the statute books in 1995. We all have stories of family or friends or neighbours or growing up in our multicultural communities. All that success happened before there was a law that has proven itself to be so flawed. All that happened before those opposite took it upon themselves to say that it is up to this parliament to license appropriate and inappropriate speech. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">But what I say also is that in this world, where technology has changed so much, the idea that we can license speech is flawed. I want speech to be free so that it can be repudiated. I want to be able to challenge the person who is racist or sexist. When there are those who would deny historic calamities like the Holocaust, I want to hear that argument so I can outline why they are wrong, why it is offensive and why it needs to be repudiated in the modern world. That is important, as we move away from historical events, even our own past, where not all events in Australian history are moments that we are proud of, but we are a product of them. Our success as a multicultural country—not being free from sin, not all having a halo—came before laws like this one that has dramatically impacted on the rights of people, albeit of a few, like that group of students from QUT. I am not trying to dismiss the idea that racism can hurt, but why is it that those opposite dismiss the accusation of state-endorsed racism and that what happened to those QUT students does not hurt them? Why is it that the process that they were put through, profoundly unfair as it was—no-one can defend it—where they were accused of being racist when they clearly were not, is somehow dismissed as not worthy of this parliament's consideration? I think that shows one-sidedness.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">One of the arguments against this change, at its core, has also been that community leaders think that this is a bad law. Well, we are not a nation of tribes. We are not a nation defined by leaders of distinct communities. We are a nation of citizens. We are a nation where every individual opinion, every individual vote, matters; and where people are accountable for what they say and it can be repudiated or they can seek to persuade their fellow citizens. The fact that self-defined community leaders—or, indeed, those elected by some but not dominating the field, not able to claim the membership of every one of that group—might think this is a bad law is not an argument that means we should not be considering a legal change, when we have demonstrated some of the problems.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">That leads to what is one of the most dangerous and, I think, one of the most offensive elements of one of the arguments used against this bill, which is that somehow certain people, because of the colour of their skin, their gender or their background, do not have the right to argue for a change to a law like this. That is the first step towards institutionalising the very racism, or the very sexism, that some of those opposite claim to oppose. I do not claim to have the experience of suffering direct racism. I cannot claim that experience. But those opposite should not say that, because I have not had that experience, my view is invalid and should be dismissed. That is the core of that argument. It is the cancer of identity politics eating away at Western civilisation, where who you are—a label assigned to you by someone else—is more important than the deeds you undertake or the words you utter.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This law has proven itself to be flawed. We have heard example after example, particularly that of the QUT students. As someone who made a small contribution to their legal fund, on a website, I say that when you have all these groups, many publicly funded—if not directly, then indirectly through access to tax deductibility status—who are able to assist complainants, how can we have a situation where thousands of dollars, let alone tens of thousands of dollars, can be accrued by people addressing a complaint that they may not have known about for a year and for which there is not the standard of evidence we would expect for someone to be subjected to a civil or criminal procedure. The process can be the punishment, and it is inappropriate for the burden and the hurdle to be so low that we can put our fellow citizens through that.—</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The other aspect of this law that has posed a problem is that it can ban opinion. I refer here to the Bolt case—not that Mr Bolt has been fan of mine over recent weeks and months, I must add. But free speech matters, regardless of the proponent and regardless of what the opinion expressed may be, because it gives us an opportunity to repudiate it. The Bolt case led to the prohibition of the publication of an article of opinion.</span>

                    </a>  It is not on the News Limited website. Well, it was not the last time I looked, because I checked. That was an article of opinion. Do we want to get to the point where the publication of articles of opinion can be prohibited by a court? I think that is profoundly troubling, because the next step will be that other opinions are banned. The problem with that is that the opinions banned are not always going to be ones that the proponents of laws like this want to see banned. </span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Under the last Labor government, there was a proposal to dramatically expand, in effect, the grounds on which free speech could be limited brought forward by the then Attorney-General, Ms Roxon. There was a proposal brought forward by the then minister for communications, Senator Conroy, that proposed—for the first time, I think, outside wartime in this country's history—the regulation of newspapers, not just broadcast media, the big difference being that the rationale for regulation of broadcast media is the public ownership of the spectrum and the fact that it is limited in quantity. But that has never been applied to newspapers because there is no limit. The idea put forward that there would be a newspaper tsar that could make rulings and compel the production of certain things in newspapers that were imposed by the state puts a great deal more faith in bureaucracy than I think any of us should have when it comes to expressing opinions.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">At the time, that was fought against very strongly by the then opposition, for the same reason that these laws are being proposed today. A law that has the effect of taking fellow citizens through a gruelling process in a profoundly unfair way—exposing them to public ridicule; to the opprobrium of being officially accused, with the stamp of a Commonwealth agency, of being racist; and to thousands of dollars of financial disadvantage, all in a process that does not meet the test of natural justice—is no way to treat our fellow citizens.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">A law that sees the prohibition of the expression of an opinion in a major newspaper, offended though some might be—but this is a country that has historically valued free debate—is a law that is endangering the larger law it is part of. I am a strong supporter of the Racial Discrimination Act in principle:  the Commonwealth should use a law to say all our citizens will be treated equally, regardless of their creed, colour or opinions. When I do citizenship ceremonies, particularly on Australia Day, I take pride in the fact that this is a country where, when someone takes the oath in good faith, they are as Australian as someone whose family has been here for six generations, like my family, or someone who was born here. There is no test other than a civic commitment to being an Australian. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">But a law that allows the perspective of some to restrict the rights of another, particularly when it is so subjective, is a law that puts the Racial Discrimination Act, in my view, at risk of not maintaining the high degree of public support that it has. The Racial Discrimination Act is an important part of our legal settlement, but this particular aspect of it will cause it damage if it continues to be used increasingly in the way we have seen it used in recent years. I do not think that anyone would like that. I read about proposals to expand the grounds upon which speech can be limited or complaints can be made, through what is effectively a replica of the Court of Star Chamber in a modern sense, although without the power to fine or imprison but with the power to put people through a fairly gruelling legal process. That is going to endanger that important piece of legislation and the degree of public support for it.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">There are certain laws where I think that the less contested they are in this place, the better, because they send a signal that they are something that all of the parliament and all the groups they represent across the country support. But we are now at the point where there is a genuine perspective from an increasing number of Australians that the law limiting speech on politically contentious opinions can be used as a weapon by one side of politics against another.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I have long opposed laws against blasphemy. I remember the action taken in, I think, the Supreme Court of Victoria against Andres Serrano's work of art—which I will not repeat the name of in the chamber because I think it is unparliamentary language. The court upheld that there was no modern law that could be used to suppress the publication of that work of art.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I do not like laws that censor. I do remember, when I was younger, reading and studying politics. It was not always my side of politics that opposed the abolition of censorship laws, but those who did oppose them I think were in the right.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Yet now, in areas that are much more politically contentious, in areas where we have confronting debates about issues where at least one side will use identity politics and talk about race or other issues as part of it, if you cannot have that debate freely and frankly, you will lead to a great deal of community conflict, and you will endanger the very strong public support we have for the Racial Discrimination Act. I do not think that is something that as a country we want to do.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">These changes are entirely reasonable and entirely appropriate. In years gone past, I would have thought that, apart from the Greens in that corner, they would have been non-contentious for the Labor Party, which once did fight for speech, to remove censorship, and supported due process. Sadly, that does not appear to be the case on changing the words that have been outlined, particularly removing 'insult' and 'offend' and replacing them with 'harass'. I think that is an appropriate balance. I would personally probably go further, but I accept that historically I am on the harder edge of free speech. This is not a First Amendment country, as someone who supports these laws once put to me.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">But this law strikes a balance that will protect the interests of those who are vulnerable. It will protect the institutions of those who support it so that it can still undertake the work that it needs to, but it will not do so by risking support for those laws by being seen to be ideologically charged or weaponised in a political context. There are many, many other debates that will become much more difficult in this country if this law is not changed. I hope the Senate sees fit to reflect the hard work by the Parliamentary Joint Committee on Human Rights and the work undertaken by the Attorney-General and others, over many years, to bring these changes forward and strike this balance.</span>

I will be the first person to rise in recognition of the advances so plainly manifest in all levels of equality and personal liberty in Western civilisation. No longer is gender, race, religion, creed or any other identifying personal characteristic a significant barrier to aspiring to the heights that one may set oneself in our Australian society.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I also recognise that some gaps still exist which may limit personal liberty and aspiration. It remains incumbent on all citizens and government to be vigilant in narrowing these gaps until they are no longer visible. However, the one area of diversity that is in risk of decline is diversity of opinion or, more precisely, the freedom to express such an opinion without fear of personal recriminations or, as we sadly see all too often, intellectual assault or even bullying of an individual by sections of our society who have disproportional capacity to complete these character assassinations.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Senators, we live in politically correct times. However, political correctness should never be used as a crutch to stifle the most basic freedom that underpins and underwrites our liberal democracy: freedom of speech. Freedom of speech is the fundamental freedom that provides the ultimate protection against tyranny and against the creeping loss of other rights and freedoms. It is hard to identify any nation that has moved from a free democratic society into an autocratic, tyrannical or dictatorial state without the right of freedom of speech first being encroached.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Freedom of speech ensures that those whose rights are infringed, those whose liberty is curtailed and those who are being victimised have the opportunity to speak out against the injustices being done to them and just as importantly, or even more importantly, allows others to speak up for them. In this place, we should be the exemplar of embracing freedom of speech.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I am sure that all senators support the rule of law, which in its simplest form means that individuals should be governed by generally applicable and publicly known laws and not by the arbitrary decisions of kings, presidents or bureaucrats. Such laws should protect the freedom of all individuals to pursue happiness in their own ways and should not aim at any particular result or outcome. The primary importance of the rule of law is the emphasis it places on certainty, generality and equality in the legal system and on an underlying reciprocity between the state and the citizen. Ultimately, the inherent prize delivered by the rule of law is that it protects citizens from tyranny in that the law is above the tyrant. It is also a key element in a working democracy in that it delivers freedom, which is the essence of democracy.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The most important aspect of the rule of law is freedom of speech. From freedom of speech flows all other freedoms. The ability to speak one's mind, to challenge the political orthodoxies of the time, to criticise the policies of the government without fear of recrimination by the state is the essential distinction between life in a free country and life in a dictatorship. US Supreme Court Justice Benjamin Cardozo, who served from 1932 to 1938, wrote of free speech that it is 'the matrix, the indispensable condition of nearly every other freedom'.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I acknowledge that in Australia decisions that are made from time to time that have the effect of restricting freedom of speech are motivated often if not always only by the best of intentions and not by any sinister agenda to deliver tyrannical outcomes. No doubt the motivations behind the enactment of our current human rights legislation were genuinely well intended, seeking to provide real, needed and appropriate protections against racist actions by some that would cause harm to others. But just because the motivations were pure and the outcomes that the actions seek to deliver are desirable does not mean that the vehicle used to seek to deliver those outcomes is the right one or the perfect one.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I note that the Labor Party has indicated it will oppose these amendments when they come to a vote. The Labor Party's form in recent years has not been good on freedom of speech, as I heard noted by Senator Ryan. Who can forget their proposal under Prime Minister Kevin Rudd mark I to licence and regulate the media? To subject the press to the restrictive powers of a licensor is to subject all freedom of sentiment to the prejudices of a bureaucratic or, worse, political decision-making process and to make that process the arbitrary and infallible judge in all controverted points in learning, religion and government. It removes the right of every free man or woman to publish their opinion and confines that right to just such a person as the government-appointed process may deem proper. I doubt I need to stress the risks to democracy of restricting the freedom of the press and subjecting that freedom to the discretion of government.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Although I noted this as an aside, it does flow into the overall debate surrounding the application of section 18C as it stands, which impacts on the freedom of expression. The notion of freedom of expression is intimately linked to political debate and therefore the practice of democracy. One of the most notable proponents of the link between freedom of speech and democracy is Alexander Mieklejohn. He argues that, since democracy is self-government by the people, an informed electorate is a necessary prerequisite. In order to be appropriately informed, there must be no constraints on the free flow of information and ideas. Mieklejohn says that 'democracy would not be true to its essential ideal if those in power are able to manipulate the electorate by withholding information and stifling criticism'. He acknowledges, as I have already canvassed, that the desire to manipulate opinion can stem from altruistic motives but argues that, even then, 'choosing manipulation negates, through its means, the democratic ideal'. If he is right—and I will contend that he is—it is incumbent on those of us in this place and the other place to fight to protect the right of Australians to discuss complex and challenging issues which may at times include subject matters or even opinions which may be controversial or even offensive to some.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We may take a dim view of a person's opinion on a matter or even find that opinion abhorrent, but that is not in itself a reason to restrict the right of that person to hold or express that opinion. Any perceived detriment from not permitting such a person to do so must be balanced against the desirable outcome of protecting his or her freedoms and liberty and that of the wider community.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Within the spectrum of political correctness, sections of the media, our public institutions and our educational institutions run the risk of falling within the narrow bandwidth of an almost singularity of expression to the exclusion of all other views. I am saddened by the fact that the prevailing so-called 'progressive' view seems too fragile to withstand the robustness of diversity of opinion. All too often we witness seek-and-destroy missions launched against individuals who feel strongly enough about an issue to speak up against the cold winds of the left agenda.</span>
                </p>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Senators, in this place above all others we must demonstrate the strength of character to allow a diversity of opinion to be expressed. In his <span style="font-style:italic;">Indictment of Socialism </span><span style="font-style:italic;">(#</span><span style="font-style:italic;">3</span><span style="font-style:italic;">)</span>, 19th-century author John Basil Barnhill wrote:</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Almost every major change in our society, whether that be social, economic, scientific or otherwise, comes from dissenters who challenge the existing paradigm. The strong voices of individuals like William Wilberforce rose up against the prevailing majority and ultimately led to the abolition of slavery in Great Britain and her colonies. Whilst I am not a proponent of such theories, the Keynesian revolution led to a radical change in the methods utilised by policymakers seeking to redress the problems of underemployment and underinvestment. Almost every national government has maintained some level of vestigial Keynesian theory in their macroeconomic policy settings.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">In scientific discovery we have seen a plethora of paradigm shifts, all possible only because authentic scientists know that we should never fall into the trap of believing that the science is settled. It never is and never should be. If the science were settled, paradigm shifts such as the transition to Mendelian inheritance from pangenesis, the transition to Einsteinian relativity from Newtonian physics and quantum mechanics replacing classical mechanics would never have occurred and the subsequent advances we are all beneficiaries of would not be improving our daily lives. In the case of each of these scientific advances, new scientific endeavour brought about by questioning existing science will inevitably move the realm of human knowledge further into understanding now beyond our comprehension or even imagination. In the same way, sometimes it takes the strong leadership of a minority view to prevail against the dismantling of institutions which have proven to serve our society so well.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The purpose of my comments in the context of the debate on ensuring that the provisions of our human rights legislation are properly focused on fully addressing racially discriminatory behaviour that should be outlawed is to reinforce the imperative that all such laws which inherently impinge on our freedom of speech must be balanced against that freedom and the benefits that it undoubtedly delivers. As Ronald Reagan once said:</span>

                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Many of the complex challenges we face in Australia are complex by nature, and by that nature require debate and discussion. Section 18C as it stands can asphyxiate such discussion and, in doing so, frustrate the best intentions of many in our community and, in doing so, undermine the very harmony in Australian society that we all strive for and, indeed, that the legislation seeks to deliver. Let me now turn to the details of the bill. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The Human Rights Legislation Amendment Bill 2017 contains measures that are intended to reform section 18C of the Racial Discrimination Act 1975 to amend the complaints handling processes of the Australian Human Rights Commission under the Australian Human Rights Commission Act and to make minor amendments to that act sought by the commission to enhance its operation and efficiency. The amendments in relation to the complaints handling processes give effect to the majority of the recommendations of the Joint Committee on Human Rights, which examined this in its report on freedom of speech in Australia, which was tabled last month. The bill will amend part IIA of the Racial Discrimination Act to redefine conduct prohibited by section 18C, to ensure that the defined conduct more accurately encompasses the notion of racial vilification. The words 'offend, insult and humiliate' will be removed from paragraph 18C(1)(a) and replaced by the word 'harass'. The word 'intimidate' will remain. The bill will also introduce 'the reasonable member of the Australian community' as the objective standard by which contravention of section 18C should be judged, rather than by the standard of a hypothetical representative member of a particular group.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I would contend that it is hard to contemplate what mischief is intended to be addressed by the Racial Discrimination Act that would not be appropriately addressed by the word 'harass' and/or 'intimidate'. I think the intention of the inclusion of the words 'offend, insult and humiliate' was originally to help eradicate certain behaviours by some of our community which would cause harm to others. Looking at the way the act is written, the reality is that the replacement of 'offend, insult and humiliate' with 'harass', combined with changing the subjective nature that currently applies in the test to a more objective one, will improve the legislation. It will better enable the legislation to ensure that, where there is behaviour that should be outlawed, that behaviour is clear, much easier to understand and better able to be addressed and dealt with.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Particularly on the objective nature of it, we often hear from those on the other side questions like, 'What is it you want to say that you cannot say now under the act?' The reality and the way I see it is that the subjective nature of the test means we just do not know the answer to that. We could be having a debate about complex issues, and there are a number of things in Australian society that are very unfortunate. We see a lot of disadvantage in some Aboriginal communities and poor health outcomes for a lot of Aboriginal people in communities across Australia. We see things that should not happen, and if they were easy to fix we would already have fixed them. They are by nature complex challenges. We cannot fix them easily, otherwise we already would have. In the context of having a discussion about how you move forward to deal with that, people will put forward ideas. We should be in a position where we can have a free and open debate on what is required to actually address these challenges and fix and resolve them. But, in the context of that, it is quite possible that somebody might make a statement which somebody else may subjectively find offensive. That statement may conceivably be a statement which could actually be useful for the debate. But until somebody finds that statement offensive, which is an entirely subjective thing under the act at the moment, we do not know what that statement would be.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">In answer to the question, 'What is it you want to say?', you just do not know what people might find offensive, despite the intent of the person saying it, which may be completely altruistic. It might be trying to help, but until that person says it, we do not know if anybody would find it offensive. We need to include a more objective test, one where the standard required to be met before the act is breached would be 'the reasonable member of the Australian community' who is impacted. That way we can create a much more objective standard which people can understand, one which makes it clear to the average Australian when the line is crossed. But if it is completely up to an individual to decide whether they are offended or not, nobody will know where that line is. So I think this is a very worthwhile amendment that should be supported.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Further, the law should provide protection from racial vilification. I agree with that and I have said that already. That is not a problem, and that will remain in the bill. It should do so in a manner which is consistent with Australia's obligations under the Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Racial Discrimination. However, the protection needs to be consistent with the right to freedom of speech, as I have already outlined in the first half of my speech. It is fundamental to the strength and health of our liberal democracy. Effective protection against racial vilification need not curtail freedom of speech. That comes back to the balance I was talking about before. However, section 18C in its current form potentially does this, without providing any extra protection from racial vilification. Also, section 18C fails to protect against racial harassment—an essential element of protection against racial vilification. The government considers that the words 'offend, insult and humiliate' do not protect people from racial vilification. Rather, they target the expression of ideas and opinions, particularly those which may be controversial or challenging, as I have already canvassed. Section 18C must be amended to address the disconnect between the ordinary meaning of the words 'offend, insult and humiliate' and the way they have been judicially interpreted.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Why is the government making these reforms? As is widely known now, the government party room has agreed to these reforms because they will strengthen Australia's anti-vilification laws. There are people on the other side criticising us, saying that this is somehow a watering down and is allowing even the removal of hate speech, which is an impression I think some people on the other side are quite happy to allow out there. This is not the case at all. Firstly, this is not about hate speech as such; it is about discrimination. These amendments will strengthen the ability of this act and the Human Rights Commission and those who enforce this act to ensure that harassment and vilification on the basis of race is minimised.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The decision of the party room followed the release of the report into freedom of speech in Australia by the Parliamentary Joint Committee on Human Rights. The government is making these reforms based on certain recommendations of that committee report. It is entirely appropriate that the government introduce legislation following those recommendations, and that is what the government is doing.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">There has been a great deal of public discussion. I think this is one of the few subjects in recent times that have been very broadly discussed. It was brought on particularly by the very unfortunate death of Australian cartoonist Bill Leak. That focused the discussion and debate in a way that it had not previously been. That great deal of public discussion has focused in particular on section 18C of the RDA and on the way in which the commission deals with complaints. A number of speakers have already referred to the case of the students at the QUT and the complaint against the late cartoonist Bill Leak, as I mentioned. Both of those were brought by the Human Rights Commission and they brought the issue to greater prominence.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I have already mentioned in my speech that there is a need to strike the right balance. In my view the government's amendments do strike the right balance between protecting social harmony, protecting people from some in Australian society who would seek to do them harm on the basis of their racial background, and mutual respect and the democratic value of freedom of speech, which underwrites our democracy.</span>

                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Victoria</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">20:09</span>):  Senator Wong commenced the second reading debate for the opposition on the Human Rights Legislation Amendment Bill 2017, highlighted the status of our concerns in this area and outlined our ongoing concerns with changes to section 18C that are represented in schedule 1 of the bill. When I was representing the shadow Attorney-General I spoke on this issue on several occasions in a former parliament. The Labor Party's position has not changed and I do not intend to occupy the Senate's time outlining those matters again—certainly several of my colleagues have gone into the detail of our concerns there—but I do want to spend a little time talking about our concerns in relation to schedule 2 of the bill, the amendments that are proposed there and the further amendments proposed by the government there.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We have serious concerns regarding these procedural amendments and also concerns with the process undertaken to address these matters. We have already had a debate in this chamber about the Senate Legal and Constitutional Affairs Legislation Committee's inquiry and the limited time involved in addressing these matters. I will indeed rely on my colleagues who have outlined those concerns in the Senate committee report. Unfortunately, a result of those concerns leads us to where we are today. So here we are at 8.10 on Thursday night failing to understand what the rush is here, apart from the fact that the government have a caucus decision and they want to stem the tide of pain that they have had over this issue and the mismanagement of this issue now over many years.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">It is very clear, as my colleagues have outlined, that there is no popular support for these changes. Polling suggests that 80 per cent of Australians are opposed to these changes. But that does not stop the ideological agenda, despite people's early thoughts about Malcolm Turnbull as a Prime Minister. It does not stop this government seeking to progress this issue.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The concern I think is best highlighted—and this is the process concern, the concern with the limited time involved—by two things in the matters before us. We have on this occasion Senator Brandis, perhaps because of the status attracting to the second reading speeches of government ministers, painting a picture quite accurately and quite clearly. It is a rare compliment from me to Senator Brandis. In his second reading speech he said:</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">The PJCHR's majority report made 22 recommendations; most concerned the Commission's complaints-handling processes. The Committee did not reach a concluded view on the appropriate wording of section 18C. Rather, it put forward a range of proposals that had the support of at least one committee member.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">That is an accurate description of recommendation No. 3. Let me compare that to the majority report of the Senate committee that looked into that bill. It certainly puzzled me with my understanding of how these matters proceeded, but I did not participate in the Senate inquiry as I now no longer represent the shadow Attorney-General. Page 8 of the report claims:</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">Recommendation 3 of the PJCHR recommended the removal of 'offend, insult, humiliate' from section 18C of the RDA.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Even Senator Brandis concedes that that is not the case. So we have listened to hour upon hour of government senators contributing to the second reading debate and it seems from their own committee report that they do not understand what the PJCHR majority found. This is a quite concerning matter.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">There was another concerning matter, but the Attorney-General has clarified this issue for me. At one stage it was suggested that the government would tonight have further government amendments to the ones circulated in relation to schedule 2. I now understand that not to be the case.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">That now denies what I understand could have been a new award for the Attorney-General, which would have meant we would now have a 'supplementary, supplementary, supplementary explanatory memorandum'. This would have been because there are significant concerns from the opposition, from the Greens and from the crossbench; even with the further government amendments to schedule 2 there are concerns with things proceeding this way.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">So why the rush—apart from, as I said, to stem the tide of pain for the coalition in relation to its ideological campaign around section 18C. Let me paint another element to this picture. Commissioner Triggs is due to conclude her term at the end of June this year. The committee has had a number of recommendations from the Human Rights Commission about concerns—and the opposition and, I think, others still have concerns about how well they are represented in the bill despite the government's further amendments. But if we are going to be changing the head of the Human Rights Commission, and if we want in the future to have an institution that can stand the test of time with confidence and with political support with a new government appointment, then why wouldn't you let these issues wait until we have determined a new head—especially given that the Human Rights Commission are still saying they have concerns with the committee inquiry in relation to how the government has addressed these procedural issues.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Going back to the PJCHR, we have consensus that procedural changes should occur. But now, in part from the Attorney-General's contribution in terms of how those recommendations have been progressed on behalf of the government, that consensus is fading and falling away. I have genuine concerns that if we are to have a Human Rights Commission that can attract public confidence, carry the test of time and address the issues that concern all of us, we need to maintain this consensus.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">So why rush this issue through now? Why not take more time to carefully consider these procedural changes? I know that all parties in this chamber have accepted that there is some level of consensus that procedural changes should occur. So why not represent that in the amendments before the chamber? This is our concern now because the government amendments that are before us do not well represent that consensus. There are still also technical and other problems that need to be addressed in a better way than a discussion at 8.20 pm when we have not understood exactly what was going to be the situation before us and where there have been suggestions that there might even be further government amendments. Why not take the time to get this right?</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I can indicate that, because of our well stated and long held concerns—clearly articulated by Labor senators in the debate again today and indeed foreshadowed by our amendments, the Greens amendments and the Nick Xenophon Team amendments to remove schedule 1 from the bill—we are adamantly opposed to the changes proposed to 18C. But because of our concerns in relation to schedule 2, we think this whole process has been compromised. For those reasons, we will be opposing the second reading of the bill. We believe the government should go away and get the schedule 2 issues right—take the time necessary, come back in May or indeed even later when we have a new head of the Human Rights Commission—and we should all work towards building a consensus and public support and confidence in a Human Rights Commission to move forward.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">For those reasons, we will be opposing the second reading. We understand that that opposition may not gain sufficient support in the Senate. If that is the case, we will then be moving to further amendments to ensure that what goes forward, if anything, is at an appropriate standard rather than our preferred position that the government go away and take the time to try and get this right.</span>

                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Queensland</span>—<span class="HPS-MinisterialTitles">Attorney-General, Vice-President of the Executive Council and Leader of the Government in the Senate</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">20:20</span>):  This has been a very important debate. I want to wind up the second reading debate on the Human Rights Legislation Amendment Bill 2017 by turning to first principles—because although most of this bill is about process issues, about how the procedures of the Australian Human Rights Commission can be reformed, most of the debate on the second reading has been on the question of the government's reforms to section 18C. So let me begin my contribution to the second reading debate by addressing the question of why the government does feel that it is important to reform section 18C.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">It is a hallmark of a free and democratic society that all of its members have the right to voice their opinions. That is what freedom of speech means. That freedom of speech is integral to the operation of a liberal democracy has been recognised by the High Court when it recognised that freedom of political communication was a necessary implication of Australia's Constitution. In 2004, Justice Michael Kirby, in Coleman v Power, put it this way:</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">In Australia, we tolerate robust public expression of opinions because it is part of our freedom and inherent in the constitutional system of representative democracy. That system requires freedom of communication. It belongs as much to the obsessive, the emotional and the inarticulate as it does to the logical, the cerebral and the restrained.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Yet, as we know, people have widely differing views. As the great American judge Oliver Wendell Holmes said more than a century ago in his famous opinion in Lochner v New York:</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">A Constitution … is made for people of fundamentally differing views.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">As both Michael Kirby and Oliver Wendell Holmes recognised, every citizen of a democracy, whoever they may be, wherever they may stand on any given issue, has an equal and fundamental right to hold and to express their views. And, however fundamentally or profoundly others may disagree with or disapprove of those views, we all, as citizens of a democracy, have an obligation to respect the equal right of every other citizen to hold and express their views. As our greatest Prime Minister, Sir Robert Menzies, said in one of his Forgotten People speeches in 1942:</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">Let us … remember that the whole essence of freedom is that it is freedom for others as well as for ourselves: freedom for people who disagree with us as well as for our supporters; freedom for minorities as well as for majorities … Most of us have no instinct at all to preserve the right of the other fellow to think what he likes about our beliefs and say what he likes about our opinions. The more primitive the community the less freedom of thought and expression is it likely to concede.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The history of liberal democracy is the history of the struggle for freedom, and that struggle has many heroes. In fairly recent memory, one of those heroes was the novelist Salman Rushdie. This is what he said:</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">… one of the problems with defending free speech is that you often have to defend people that you find to be outrageous and unpleasant and disgusting.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">But that is the price we pay to live in a free society. We cannot demand for ourselves a greater right to express our opinions than we are prepared to concede to any other citizen, regardless of how objectionable their opinions may be to us. In the words of Noam Chomsky, a great hero of the left whom I am not often given to quoting:</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">If we don't believe in freedom of expression for people we despise, we don't believe in it at all.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">That is why I said, in the first speech I ever gave in this chamber:</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">… a liberal society is only worthy of the name if its citizens enjoy an absolute right to hold, and to express, opinions which other members of society find outrageous. Any attempt to limit that right, whether by actual censorship of opinions or by the insidious new cultural tyranny sometimes called 'political correctness', is a fundamental violation of a free society. For as long as I sit in this place I will defend the absolute right of all citizens to the free expression of their opinions—no matter how unfashionable, ignorant or offensive those opinions may seem to others.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">That is where I stood 17 years ago and that is where I stand tonight.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We see the clash of fundamentally different views on display every day here in the Senate. The very purpose of parliament is to bring those views together, as representative of the whole Australian people, and engage in a contest of ideas as we debate the great issues of the day. Sometimes, as we debate those ideas, we will say things that are offensive to others, or insulting, or even humiliating. That is partly because one person's ideas may themselves be offensive to a person who has a completely different point of view, and sometimes because in making our case we use words that may hurt the feelings of others. That is the way democracies work. That is why we proudly describe our democracy as robust. In a democracy, it should never be a reason to censor somebody's participation in debate that others may feel offended, insulted or humiliated by what they say.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">What political cartoon, for instance, does not humiliate its subject? That, in a sense, is its very purpose—to make a point, sharply, wittily and memorably. That is the essence of satire. That is something that the late, great Bill Leak, whose spirit, in a sense, presides over this debate tonight, knew better than anyone, which is why his cartoons were so penetrating and so effective. It was something the cartoonists at <span style="font-style:italic;">Charlie Hebdo</span> knew too, which is why they were the target of authoritarians and fanatics, who slayed them because they dared to exercise their right to free speech.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Yet section 18C of the Racial Discrimination Act specifically prohibits the expression of views merely because they may insult, offend or humiliate. It is political censorship, pure and simple. A law like that has no place in a free country. It is not to the point that section 18D provides certain carve-outs or exemptions. There should not need to be exemptions from a prohibition on free speech, because free speech is a fundamental human right which should never be censored in the first place. And, of course, whatever the exemptions, the very existence in our law of a provision like section 18C has a chilling effect on freedom of speech which can never be measured but is, inevitably, harmful. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Nor is it to the point that the limitations on 18C apply only to speech that concerns race, colour, or national or ethnic origin. Politicians cannot not loudly proclaim their belief in freedom of speech and, at the same time, ring-fence one area of public discussion—discussion about race or ethnicity—and say that freedom of speech principles do not apply to them. And, yet, that is the very thing opponents of these reforms have sought to do. That was the great vice in the attempt to censor the famous Bill Leak cartoon, which drew attention to an undoubted and severe social problem—the neglect of Indigenous children by delinquent fathers—and yet was said to fall foul of section 18C merely because it related to the question of race. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Indeed, it is the crowning irony of this debate that those who champion section 18C have actually in this very debate attacked those of us who favour reform, because of the colour of our skin. When on Tuesday I said that I did not believe that Australia was a racist nation, what did Senator Bilyk say by way of interjection? 'Coming from a white man,' she said. Senator McCarthy, in her contribution, said that I would not understand the issue because I was 'a white man growing up in Petersham', and Senator Di Natale said that this bill 'has everything to do with allowing a very small group of very privileged, largely older white folk in this place to be more racist than they might otherwise be.' </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Those remarks are, of course, deeply offensive and insulting. It is deeply offensive and insulting to me for Senator Bilyk and Senator McCarthy to suggest that the reason I support this bill is because of the colour of my skin. It is even more offensive to everyone in this chamber for Senator Di Natale to say suggest that older white folk in this chamber support this bill so as to allow them to be—in his words—'even more racist than they might otherwise be'. But, surely, it shows how impossibly weak the argument is of those who argue against reform of section 18C that, in order to make their argument, they have to engage themselves in the very conduct which section 18C outlaws: to offend and insult those of a different point of view because of the colour of their skin. And, yet, that is what they have done. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The difference is: I do not seek to censor Senator Bilyk, Senator McCarthy or Senator Di Natale, offensive and insulting though their language is, because, like Michael Kirby and those others whom have I quoted, I accept that, in a robust freedom-loving democracy, it is never a sufficient reason to censor another point of view either because it is offensive or because it is expressed in offensive language. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This is not primarily a debate about race; it is a debate about free speech. Even if it had been a debate about race, it no longer is since the Labor Party has now said that it would seek to broaden section 18C to cover religious beliefs—that is what Dr Anne Aly said only two days ago, and she is not a lone voice. In 2012, the Labor Party Attorney-General Nicola Roxon released an exposure draft of amendments to anti-discrimination law which would have applied section 18C to some 18 so-called protected attributes, including, incredibly, industrial history, political opinion and social origin. How in a free country can we have a debate, if it is impossible to say anything that might offend another person on account of their political opinion? The answer is: if we were to do so, we would not be a free country any more. I am not a great believer in floodgate arguments, but I am bound to say, given that we know where the Labor Party's mind is on this issue and where a future Labor government may take us, the section 18C debate takes on an even more serious and indeed sinister significance. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Coming back to section 18C, as it currently stands, I have explained why the government is moving to remove the words offend, insult and humiliate because they impose an impossible burden upon the freedom of expression, the freedom of speech which, as I say, is a hallmark of a liberal democracy. If there is anyone left in this country who sincerely believes that section 18C should not be reformed, let them ask themselves this question: what kind of racial vilification law fails to prohibit harassment? Those who oppose this reform should ask themselves this question: what is the conduct that they would prohibit which is not already caught by the concepts of harassment and intimidation? It can only be the expression of ideas and opinions. Yet the one thing a free society must never do is to censor the expression of ideas and opinions. Anyone who is prepared to do so, in the name of whatever other value, cannot pretend to be a believe in freedom of speech.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The amendments the government will move will ensure that Australia is better compliant with its obligations under the International Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Racial Discrimination. Almost every country in the world—some 178 nations—is party to that convention. Article 2 obliges the states party to 'prohibit and bring to an end, by all appropriate means, including legislation as required by circumstances, racial discrimination by any persons, group or organisation'. How revealing is it that none of the opposition speakers against this bill have been able to point to a single country whose domestic law contains a provision expressed in the terms of section 18C, prohibiting behaviour merely because it is offensive or insulting? Do you know why? Because there is not one. Not one nation on earth which seeks to protect against racism gives effect to the convention against racial discrimination by the use of that language. Those who foolishly say that this amendment gives a green light to racism need to explain why not a single country in the entire world has a section 18C.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The reforms to section 18C add the word 'harassment' to the word 'intimidate' as prohibited forms of conduct. That does not raise free speech issues. Intimidation and harassment are not exercises of free speech. Rather, they are and have always been acknowledged to be species of unlawful conduct. The fact that that conduct might take the form of spoken or written words is beside the point. To intimidate another person—in other words, to threaten them or to cause them fear—or to harass another person—in another words, to vex, to annoy or to attack them—is to intrude upon the other person's freedom itself. Such conduct has nothing to do with freedom of speech, and its prohibition is entirely justifiable both to protect freedom and to protect social order. That is why I have always believed that there is no inconsistency whatever between effective, appropriately worded racial vilification laws and the robust defence of freedom of speech, and that is the principled reason why the government is moving to reform section 18C and, at the same time, to strengthen its antivilification provisions and to remove its anti-free-speech provisions—not inconsistent objectives but complementary ones. <span style="font-style:italic;">(Time expired)</span></span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The purpose of this amendment is to clarify the meanings of the words 'intimidate' and 'harass' in section 18C as it would appear, assuming the bill is passed. The bill proposes to expand the meanings in two ways. In the first place, there is within the bill an expanded meaning given to the term 'harass' so that it is clear that a single act may constitute harassment and that it is not necessary for there to be a multiplicity or series of acts for the prohibition against harassment to be violated. That, of course, depends on the circumstances of the particular case.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This amendment adds a further clarifying definition to the words 'intimidate' and 'harass' by making it clear that those prohibitions may be violated even if the statement, comment or remark said to constitute intimidation or harassment is not made in the presence of the other person. There are many circumstances which we can envisage where conduct may be intimidating or constitute harassment even though it is not made face to face. An obvious example is stalking a person through social media and uttering intimidating or harassing remarks through social media. Another example would be delivering documents or letters through the mail or sending an email to a person which contained intimidating or harassing conduct.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">To put the matter beyond doubt, this amendment makes it clear that conduct of that kind and indeed any conduct not in the presence of the person who is the victim which would otherwise constitute harassment or intimidation does constitute harassment or intimidation, notwithstanding that it was not made in the presence of the victim.</span>

I should make it clear that that part of the definition is already in the bill. It is not part of the government amendment that I am moving now. But just to clarify the point, and to go to the section of the bill to which you refer, the reason that amendment was made is that there is in fact some ambiguity both in the case law and in the dictionary definition of whether harassment requires more than one act. In the <span style="font-style:italic;">Macquarie Dictionary</span>, the word 'harassment' is defined exclusively in terms of a series or multiplicity of acts, but in the <span style="font-style:italic;">Oxford English Dictionary</span>, the word 'harassment' is defined in at least one of its senses as conduct which might be constituted by a single act. The same is the case in the case law. That is why we have clarified the definition. But in relation to the specific question you asked, I am not aware of the genesis of that proposition.</span>

However, it is certainly not the intention of the definition of 'harass' or, indeed, 'intimidate' that the government has included to include conduct of the kind that you refer to. So that harassment according to its ordinary speech meaning—which is as the explanatory memorandum explains, and subject to the two clarifying definitional amendments to which I have referred—I would have thought requires knowledge by the victim of the harassment of the fact of the harassment taking place.</span>

This amendment cannot cure the defects in the government's approach to watering down the longstanding protections against racial hate speech.</span>

In doing so, we will maintain absolute consistency in our view that there has been no case made by the government for a change to section 18C, none whatsoever, despite lengthy and at times acrimonious debate in this place and the broader Australian community. We have listened to multicultural Australia. We will stand shoulder to shoulder with them. They have asked us to support retaining section 18C precisely as it is currently worded. On that basis we will be opposing this amendment.</span>

Can you comment on or explain or confirm the fact that the inclusion of harassment and intimidation refers to the desire of the person accused of harassing and intimidating to actually have an impact on the behaviour of the person against whom the harassment and/or the intimidation has been levelled, in contrast to offend or to insult, which is more associated, as I understand it, with the offence to the person but without having an effect on the behaviour or the daily activity of the person who would be the subject of the offence or the intimidation.</span>

                      <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Senator BRANDIS</span>
                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Queensland</span>—<span class="HPS-MinisterialTitles">Attorney-General, Vice-President of the Executive Council and Leader of the Government in the Senate</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">20:58</span>):  Senator Back, the simple answer to the first part of your question is: because the inclusion of the word 'harass', which is a grievous shortcoming in section 18C as it currently stands, is intended to overcome that shortcoming. The concept of harassment, which is very commonly used in antidiscrimination statutes, both in Australia and overseas, captures the notion of conduct which impinges on a person in an unwelcome manner so as to limit or restrict their freedom. It is in a sense broader than 'intimidate', because the concept of intimidation involves causing fear in the person to whom it is directed. It is possible to imagine conduct that constitutes harassment but does not constitute intimidation, because not every person who is harassed is made fearful, but that does not mean that their freedom, their amenity, their life is not in some way vexed or annoyed or a nuisance is made to them by the conduct concerned.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">In relation to your second question, Senator Back, it is not an element of this provision that the offender, the person whose conduct is prohibited, has any particular motive. There is no requirement, as in the criminal law, of a guilty mind, as it were. There is no requirement of malice. There is no requirement that the conduct be other than conduct which meets the definitions of 'intimidate' or 'harass'. But the reaction of the person who is the victim—and this goes, so far as 'harassment' is concerned, in part to Senator Bernardi's question—is relevant, so that, if a person, for example, were oblivious to or unaware of conduct, it would be difficult to see how that were harassing if it had no effect on them, or intimidatory if it did not cause fear in their mind.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Anyway, the overall answer to your question is: we are trying to bring this statute more closely into conformity with discrimination law best practice, with Australia's obligations under the Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Racial Discrimination. Section 18C, regardless of the rhetorical claims made by those who oppose what the government is trying to do, does not do that. These amendments make section 18C a more fit, suitable and better expressed protection against racism.</span>

We are well familiar with people who send intimidating or harassing text messages. That could very easily constitute harassment, even though not made in the presence of the victim.</span>

                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Queensland</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">21:03</span>):  Senator Brandis, I apologise in advance if you or anyone else in the chamber had to endure my presentation earlier, on the second reading, but I will take a little bit of time to lay down the basis for my question, and I will value your comments.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I have five or six matters, but I will deal with them one at a time. My first area of interest is to understand what changes will occur as a result of these amendments to the process. I might just set the scene. I spoke earlier, as did a number of other speakers, with respect to the QUT issue, where, as you know, there were three students who became entangled in the process over a period of time. It would appear to me—and you may contradict me—as if there were an absence of natural justice in some aspects of how that particular case was managed. In particular, it would seem that there was a long period of time where at least one of the students, and perhaps all of them, was not even aware that the process was in train, thereby of course denying them any ability they may have had, with a contemporary memory, to be able to, for want of a better term, defend themselves, or at least give instructions to those who might provide them with professional advice.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">As it went on, it is said that they received pro bono assistance from legal identities in the process. Quotes have been made that, had they needed to engage legal assistance, the cost of such legal support might have been greater than $10,000 per person. As I said earlier, I found, based on my experiences in life in dealing with lawyers—and I do not want to reflect adversely on lawyers; I am surrounded, it would seem—</span>

                    </a>  Why?</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">

                    </a>  Or vets! The fact of the matter is: that seemed to be on the light side. So, if it were a matter that was complex and protracted, I would think that the cost burden on an individual, in this case a student, could have been substantially higher, perhaps even in the scope of $20,000 to $30,000.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">In addition to that, we had the costs that would have been borne in this case, I suspect, by the educational facility, the QUT. They no doubt would have incurred costs. I am sure that they looked at their own position as to whether there may have been some contribution on their part to what appeared to be an area that was, for want of a better term, segregated—in this case, facilities at the university that were not available for use by these three students, at least.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We had the Human Rights Commission involved. Obviously, they had a role to play. There is absolutely no doubt that. if one were able to make a cost assumption about their contribution. we could find ourselves in the scope of between $100,000 and $200,000 to deal with a matter that, even if it had been upheld, would seem to have been somewhat on the trivial end, somewhat on the lighter end, in terms of a question that needed to be answered. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">When you add to that, Attorney, the human cost to these three students and, I expect, their families—these are young people, so their parents, their brothers and sisters, and partners, if they have been blessed in life with partners—the stress and distress, the fear, would be quite significant. We know of course that they could not help but suffer some reputational damage. I made the point earlier that in decades to come, when fellow students or alumni are reminded of their identities, they will not be remembered for their athletic prowess or their intellect; they will be remembered as being the students involved in this particular incident. I am sure that prospective employers would reflect upon the circumstances that gave rise to their dilemma up when they consider them for employment or some form of appointment.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The statement was made, I think, by one of the students, that the process itself was a punishment. They had to endure this for a terribly long period of time. This all played out eventually in a very public way. I cannot imagine the stress and turmoil in their lives, and the distraction, as they went ahead and battled this. On top of all that, as a matter of expediency, as often happens in civil cases, they settled. They paid $5,000, which, for all the students I know, would mean the sale of a liver, an arm or a leg for them to be able to fund that sort of settlement.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">So, all in all, Attorney, we have hundreds of thousands of dollars expended, a great deal of it from the public purse. Important resources, like those of the Human Rights Commission, were distracted in these protracted and otherwise seemingly trivial issues. There were lawyers representing them pro bono, so there is a cost involved in that—we all know there is no such thing as a free lunch. I am sure that I have missed four or five other features.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I am sorry that I have spent so much time laying the framework for that, but it does lead me to the question. Without going to the substantive adjustments here to the language, Attorney, are you able to reflect upon what the changes to process might be, notwithstanding all other things, that will to some extent mitigate or help us to avoid circumstances like the QUT case into the future?</span>

We are actually not up to the process amendments yet, but now is as good a time as any to address the issue that you raise. </span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">May I say at the outset that, when the history of freedom in Australia is written, the QUT students will be remembered as heroes. These young men will be remembered as heroes, and their legal representatives, led by my esteemed colleague from the Queensland bar Tony Morris QC will also be remembered as Australian heroes—just as the people who persecuted them, like Cindy Prior, will go down in history as villains.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Senator O'Sullivan, the purpose of schedule 2 of the bill, which we have not yet dealt with but it is appropriate as well to speak of in response to your question, is to avoid the persecution which the QUT students suffered and bravely stared down. Senator, you quoted the remark, 'The process is the punishment.' One of the problems with the Human Rights Commission, which, by the way, it itself in part acknowledges, is that its processes are too complex, and there are too few opportunities for the commission and, in particular, for the president to intervene at an early stage of a complaint to terminate the complaint if it is not evidently meritorious. That is one of the main purposes of the schedule 2 amendments, and in saying so I want to acknowledge Professor Triggs' contribution to the government's thinking. In drafting these amendments, we did not agree on every single thing, but in relation to the process amendments we agreed on the vast majority of the measures the government proposes.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Senator O'Sullivan, nobody can know the psychological cost to teenagers of being subjected to that kind of treatment. Ironically, they were the people who were harassed. They were the people who were harassed. They were the people who were, at least at one stage of the proceedings, humiliated. They were the ones who were the subject of the vile and false allegation that they were racist when they are entirely innocent.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">It makes my gorge rise, I must say, to stand in a chamber like this and see parties of the Left mock victims the way they mock the QUT students, who richly deserve to be named Australians of the year, as did Tony Morris QC. Senator O'Sullivan, as to the cost, Mr Morris and those who instructed him did, in the fine traditions of the legal profession at its best, donate their services to fight the good fight for this important cause. But for their generosity and their professional benevolence, the cost to a person in the position of the QUT students, facing a case fought all the way to the Federal Court, would have been many tens of thousands of dollars. I am not quite sure how many hearing days it involved, but the process proceeded over, altogether, more than two years, I believe. For the cost in legal fees alone of a proceeding that long, I dare say that there would not have been any change out of a six-figure sum. So there is the psychological cost to these young men, and there is the potential cost that, but for the generosity of Mr Morris and those who instructed him, they or their parents would have been obliged to incur.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Because the process can be the punishment, we are amending, by schedule 2 of the bill, the Human Rights Commission Act to allow for early intervention at the threshold by the president to terminate unmeritorious or hopeless complaints. We are limiting the capacity of unmeritorious complainants who want to game the system, to use the courts as a vehicle to try and game the system, to try and extort a financial settlement out of a person against whom a complaint has been made. There are various other procedural reforms as well to ensure that there is a timely resolution of complaints, that there is a swift dismissal of unmeritorious complaints and that there are strict natural justice obligations that do not exist as thoroughly as they ought to in the act as it stands at the moment.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">So, Senator O'Sullivan, I hope that addresses the issues that you had in mind. You are a scholarly man, I know, Senator O'Sullivan, so you would be well familiar with Franz Kafka's novel <span style="font-style:italic;">The Trial</span>, which is all about that proposition that subjecting a person to a vexatious and long legal or administrative process can itself be punitive. How ironic is it that it is the very institution in our society designed to uphold and vindicate human rights that has been used by vexatious people as a vehicle to oppress and deny the human rights of innocent respondents? As a result of the government amendments of this bill, which I hope will be passed through the parliament tonight, the vicious and vexatious use of the Human Rights Commission by such people will be much more difficult, if not impossible.</span>

I managed to have the dictionary definition of 'harass' here. It says that 'harass', the verb, means 'subject to aggressive pressure or intimidation'—we are not dealing with intimidation. Then 1.1 is 'to make repeated small-scale attacks'. I come back to this point, Attorney. I accept your explanation about not being present in dealing with social media and electronic communications; however, I am struggling with the concept of 'harass' in the singular. All the dictionaries that I have consulted make it quite plain that it is about repeated attacks or ongoing harassment. I seek comfort because, at the moment, I am struggling to support this in the event that someone puts up a single tweet or a single Facebook post or sends a single email or there is a single instance that someone finds annoying, and that constitutes harassment under the definition or under the amendment that you are proposing in this bill.</span>

But, you are right, Senator Bernardi, that the most common use of the word 'harassment' does contemplate a multiplicity of acts, and that is the only way in which the word is defined in the <span style="font-style:italic;">Macquarie</span><span style="font-style:italic;"> Dictionary</span>, so the lexicographers have a difference about this. In the case law, most of the case law suggests a multiplicity of acts, but there is at least one decision, a case in the Federal Court called Hall v Sheiban in 1989, in which one of the judges suggested that a single act in certain circumstances could constitute harassment. If the lexicographers cannot agree and the judiciary cannot agree, who are we, mere senators, to resolve the issue?</span>

In the common parlance and the acceptance from most of the dictionary definitions as well as, I think, the reasonable man test that you are also trying to change into 18C—or the reasonable person test, for risk of causing offence—'harass' means multiple instances. You have cited one court case from 1989 in which a Federal Court judge found a single instance. Wouldn't it be much more prudent to use the common and accepted understanding of what 'harass' is rather than open it up to claims where a single Facebook post, a single tweet or a single comment could be claimed to be harassment and subject the individual who had said or written those things to the process of 18C, which is deleterious?</span>

The way courts read statutes is that, where a statutory definition is given as we propose to give it here, the statutory definition prevails over the dictionary definition. If it be the case that there is no doubt that in ordinary speech 'harassment' means a multiplicity of acts then that ordinary-language meaning yields to the explicit statutory definition in proposed subsection 2C. In this case, as I have already said a couple of times now, the dictionaries themselves define the word 'harassment' in both senses and the case law is also divided on the question. Where the dictionaries are divided on the question and the case law is divided on the question, the sensible thing, it seems to me, is to put it beyond doubt by a very simple and clearly worded amendment which makes it plain that either a single act or a series of acts can constitute 'harassment', and that is the way the courts would read the provision.</span>

You are right and the member for Goldstein, Mr Wilson, is right as well. When section 18C was inserted into the Racial Discrimination Act by the 1995 amendments, those amendments themselves were designed to give effect to the recommendations of an inquiry conducted by what was then called the Human Rights and Equal Opportunity Commission, which was the predecessor body of the Australian Human Rights Commission. That inquiry was called the National Inquiry into Racist Violence. There had been two earlier inquiries which touched upon the matter. One was the Royal Commission into Aboriginal Deaths in Custody. There was a third inquiry as well, the name of which I do not quite recall. But there were three. But the immediate inquiry, whose findings were specifically adopted by the amendments to the Racial Discrimination Act in 1995, was the Human Rights and Equal Opportunity Commission's inquiry entitled National Inquiry into Racist Violence, and that inquiry, as did the other two, specifically recommended that the word 'harass' be included as one of the species of prohibited conduct. It has never been explained why that recommendation was not adopted by the Keating government given that the purpose of part 2A of the Racial Discrimination Act, which includes section 18C, was explicitly, as Mr Lavarch, the then Attorney-General, said in his second reading speech, designed to give effect to the recommendations of the HREOC National Inquiry into Racist Violence.</span>

                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">But I must say that anyone who says—and we have heard from many opposition and Greens speakers in this debate—they do not want section 18C changed, whatever else they may be saying, is necessarily saying they do not want racial harassment to be prohibited in Australia. They do not want to give effect, albeit belatedly, to the recommendations of the Human Rights and Equal Opportunity Commission's National Inquiry into Racist Violence. The government does want to do that, and I think it is a disgrace that others who denounce those who are promoting this bill as seeking to encourage racism of all things try to prevent us reforming the bill to give effect to the findings of the National Inquiry into Racist Violence.</span>

                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Victoria</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">21:29</span>):  I have a related follow-up question. I understand that the person who conducted the inquiry on behalf of the then Human Rights and Equal Opportunity Commission into racist violence was Irene Moss. She was recently interviewed by <span style="font-style:italic;">The Australian</span> newspaper journalist Chris Merritt, who has followed this issue with great interest and with great accuracy, in my view. In his interview with Irene Moss, she told him that in fact her view and the view of the inquiry was that it would be a bad idea to go down that route of preventing mere offence and insult, because that could lead to the law being applied in a way it was not intended and being applied in a broader way than was intended, and that it may end up capturing conduct that was not in fact intended. She reiterated her view from the early 1990s again today, saying that she believed her original view has been proven correct by the application of the law in the courts, particularly in recent cases, and that she was right then to warn against the adoption of a law which sought to limit offence based merely on offence and insulting conduct.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">One of the primary instigators of this original law has warned against specifically the route the law went down. She has since said that all her fears about this law have come true and has suggested that we revisit this law and reflect its original intentions. Why is it, in your view, that many people have said in this debate that only those who want to unleash racism are in favour of changing this law? I presume they are not referring to Irene Moss, and I presume they do believe that Irene Moss wants to unleash racism.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Senator Paterson, you are right to say that Irene Moss, a former Race Discrimination Commissioner, was in fact the author of the <span style="font-style:italic;">Report of the National Inquiry </span><span style="font-style:italic;">i</span><span style="font-style:italic;">nto Racist Violence</span><span style="font-style:italic;"> in Australia</span>. And you are right when you say that she did make that recommendation, and she has made the observations that you have quoted. By the way, she is not alone among people, many of whom would be regarded as inhabiting the left of the political spectrum, who have expressed the view that the removal of 'offend' and 'insult' and the insertion of 'harassment' is a good thing. Those people include Warren Mundine. They include the Hon. Jim Spigelman, a former Chief Justice of New South Wales and at one time the principal private secretary to Mr Gough Whitlam. They include Mr Paul Howes. They include Professor George Williams of the University of New South Wales, a former Labor Party preselection candidate and a well-known constitutional scholar and commentator. They include the Hon. Ron Sackville, former judge of the Federal Court. They include the journalist David Marr. They include the editorial writers of <span style="font-style:italic;">The Sydney Morning Herald</span><span style="font-style:italic;">,</span> who have also expressed that opinion. They include the Australian Law Reform Commission, which in its report on traditional rights and freedoms, delivered in December 2015, on page 119, had this to say about section 18C of the Racial Discrimination Act:</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Small">… it appears that pt IIA of the RDA, of which s 18C forms a part, would benefit from more thorough review in relation to freedom of speech.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">In particular, there are arguments that s 18C lacks sufficient precision and clarity, and unjustifiably interferes with freedom of speech by extending to speech that is reasonably likely to ‘offend’. The provision appears broader than is required under international law to prohibit the advocacy of racial hatred and broader than similar laws in other jurisdictions, and may be susceptible to constitutional challenge.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">That was the opinion of the Australian Law Reform Commission, and its chair, Professor Rosalind Croucher, who in that particular reference was assisted by the Hon. John Middleton, a much respected judge of the Federal Court of Australia, and Emeritus Professor Suri Ratnapala of the TC Beirne School of Law at the University of Queensland. And of course we had in an interview with Fran Kelly last November, even the president of the Human Rights Commission, Professor Gillian Triggs, observing that it was appropriate to review and strengthen section 18C. When I quoted her in the Senate hearing last Friday, there were some unsavoury interjections from certain Labor and Greens senators—</span>

                    </a>  Hard to believe!—until Professor Triggs said; 'What Senator Brandis has just said is absolutely correct. I did say that, and that is my view.' If you want to make the case that Warren Mundine is a racist, that Jim Spigelman is a racist, that George Williams is racist, that Rosalind Croucher is a racist, that Gillian Triggs is a racist, that David Marr is a racist, that <span style="font-style:italic;">The Sydney Morning Herald</span> is a racist newspaper and that the Australian Law Reform Commission is a racist organ, as those on the other side of this debate do, go right ahead. But those are the people who have lined up on the government's side of this argument.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">There it is in black and white. Despite being asked twice to make a submission on section 18D, the legal representatives of Mr Leak and <span style="font-style:italic;">The Australian</span> refused to do so.</span>

                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">You have to ask yourself: why did they refuse to do so? The answer is blindingly obvious. They wanted to run a vendetta against the Human Rights Commission, because of course they had already submitted to the commission that in their view—a spurious view though it was—the Human Rights Commission ought not hear the complaint against Mr Leak and it should be heard by an independent person. That was the view expressed by the legal representatives of <span style="font-style:italic;">The Australian</span> and Mr Leak. That had no merit and the commission quite rightly, in a very lengthy and considered response, said that they had considered that submission and determined that in fact they were the appropriate body to hear it and the accusation of apprehended bias that was made was a complete load of rubbish. Just to be clear, that last phrase is me paraphrasing the commission. Those are not the words the commission used.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">But make no mistake there was a vendetta being run. There was a murky, nasty, aggressive campaign being run by <span style="font-style:italic;">The Australian</span> and Mr Leak against the Human Rights Commission and Professor Gillian Triggs. It should be named up, and I am naming it up here tonight. They got overtaken in that vendetta by their desire to continue their campaign and that is why they refused to make a section 18D submission. Professor Triggs has been very clear—and I will paraphrase her here—in saying that, if Mr Leak had made a section 18D submission, it is very likely that the commission would have acted to immediately terminate that matter. Of course it is blindingly obvious that Mr Leak and <span style="font-style:italic;">The Australian</span> had a section 18D defence in regards to the cartoon that was the subject of the complaint. It is blindingly obvious that Mr Leak—</span>

You will get your chance in a minute. It was blindingly obvious to any independent and reasonable person watching what was going on that <span style="font-style:italic;">The Australian</span> and Mr Leak were more interested in running their vendetta against the commission and Professor Triggs than they were in settling that matter, and that means that all of the arguments that we have heard about how terrible a trauma this whole thing was for people at <span style="font-style:italic;">The Australian</span> and Mr Leak are premised on marshmallows, because they could have submitted on section 18D at any time and the overwhelming likelihood would have been that the commission would have acted to dismiss the case.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">But they did not, because remember they were using the complaint that was not made by the commission; it was made by another person. The commission had statutory responsibilities to conduct an inquiry in regards to that complaint, and they did that and they did that properly. At all times they encouraged <span style="font-style:italic;">The Australian</span>, Mr Leak and the legal representatives of <span style="font-style:italic;">The Australian</span> and Mr Leak to submit a section 18D defence to the commission but they would not do it because they were more interested in having a fight than they were in settling the matter.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">So it is gross hypocrisy for Senator Brandis, Senator Paterson and all the other agents of the IPA in this place to come in here and use this case as any kind of an argument against 18C—for a start. It is also rampant hypocrisy for Senator Brandis, Senator Paterson and any of the other agents of the IPA in this place to come in here and use the Leak case as an argument for reform of the commission's processes. I agree that there are actually other cases that do at least constitute an argument for reform of the commission's processes. But not the Leak case—that is a spurious argument because it is blindingly obvious that neither <span style="font-style:italic;">The Australian</span> nor Mr Leak had any interest whatsoever in settling that matter. They were spoiling for a fight. The whole raison d'etre of <span style="font-style:italic;">The Australian</span> in recent times has been to run a vicious, vindictive, appalling campaign against the Human Rights Commission, against Professor Triggs and against section 18C of the RDA. Make no mistake, that was their motivation here. They did not want to settle this matter, they wanted to prolong it because they thought it suited the vendetta and the campaign they were running.</span>

Nevertheless, Senator McKim, leaving aside all the personal abuse, venom and vituperation that has fallen from your lips in the last 15 minutes, has it not dawned on you that you have just made an extremely strong case for the government's procedural amendments? To use your words, if it be the case that Mr Leak had a 'clear and unambiguous 18D defence', that it was 'blindingly obvious' that he had a section 18D defence and that Professor Gillian Triggs, the president, was 'virtually begging him to make a submission relying on an 18D defence', which 'would have undoubtedly succeeded', then that is the strongest argument you could possibly make for why there should be, as the government amendments propose, an early termination power vested in the president so that the president does not have to await a joinder of issue between a complainant and a respondent where palpably the respondent's position is meritorious and undoubtedly the respondent's position would be vindicated were the issue to be joined between the complainant and the respondent. If that is the case, as Professor Triggs herself has asked for, there should be an early termination proceeding rather than requiring there to be a joinder of issue between the parties. So in view of the argument you have just made, Senator McKim, no doubt you will be voting for the government's amendments on schedule 2.</span>

The Attorney well knows that many of the changes he is proposing in this legislation are not supported by the Human Rights Commission. The Greens' position will continue to be that we will support the reasonable amendments proposed by the government that are in line with the views of the commission, and that we intend to move our own amendments to the bill currently before the Senate to ensure that the procedural amendments made by this legislation, should it pass, are in fact in line with the wishes of the Human Rights Commission.</span>

I know he thinks he is the smartest bloke in the room, but the simple fact of the matter is that he is not quite as smart as he thinks he is. His argument, clever though it may have sounded, has no merit whatsoever—and I note that he in no way addressed the substance of my previous contribution, which was, in effect, that neither <span style="font-style:italic;">The Australian</span> nor Mr Leak had any genuine interest in settling the matter that was before the Human Rights Commission expeditiously and that, in fact, to the contrary, they intended to use that complaint, which was put before the Human Rights Commission by another person, as a weapon in their ongoing vendetta against the commission, against Professor Triggs and against section 18C of the Racial Discrimination Act.</span>

                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Queensland</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">21:54</span>):  I have been listening to this debate tonight and I want to follow on from what Senator Cory Bernardi said and ask about the word 'harass'. I have looked at the dictionary and it says that 'harass' means 'to make repeated small-scale attacks', 'to annoy with repeated attacks' or 'to disturb persistently'. That is from the Macquarie dictionary. Item (2B)(a) of the bill refers to a 'single isolated act'. Senator Brandis, regarding 'a single isolated act', I know you referred to material on the internet and tweets. I am not a legal mind—I do not come from that background—but, if a court makes a decision, it is based on what is actually in law. That means, if it is based on the law of (2B)(a), it must come down to a single isolated act. If there is nothing in the law, then the judge would have to go back to the definition of the word 'harass', which would go back to the definition in the dictionary, which refers to multiple acts. So is it feasible to say, if we legislate it, that the courts will determine it from the point of view of a single act? Is that how the courts will interpret it?</span>

The most common meaning of the word 'harass' is, as you rightly say, 'a series of acts' or 'a multiplicity of acts', but there is some doubt about that because there is at least one sense in the Oxford dictionary's definition of the word and there is one judicial decision in Australia, a case called Sheiban, which suggest that a single act may constitute harassment. So there is a degree of ambiguity about whether or not a single act may in particular circumstances constitute harassment.</span>

                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">To avoid, or to clear up, that ambiguity, the purpose of this subsection would be to put it beyond doubt that harassment could be constituted by a single act or by a series of acts—either would do—and a court approaching a particular case in which harassment was alleged would interpret the word 'harassment' in the act according to this subsection so that it could have regard to an act which was a single isolated act or it could have regard to a series of acts. So this broadens to the broadest possible degree what the understanding of 'harassment' could be.</span>

People in a heated moment, even on the internet where they respond to something that they have seen, might make a comment or tweet or say something—but it is in the heat of the moment, in reaction to what they may read or see or whatever. But then, if they were to harass, they would do it more than once, so it really becomes vexatious—they are really harassing. So, if someone makes a stupid statement or a comment at any time which could see them taken before the Human Rights Commission through the Racial Discrimination Act, wouldn't it be best, if they are vexatious and continually harass, for it to be looked at under those circumstances rather than just on a single act?</span>

So, the purpose of this amendment is merely to get rid of the ambiguity and make it clear that a single act could constitute harassment or a series of acts could constitute harassment, depending on the facts of the particular case.</span>

                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Victoria</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">22:07</span>):  I will not speak long on this, because I think there is one main point that needs to be highlighted. We have heard lots of flowery language and lots of debate amongst members of the government with each other, but the critical issue here is that the change in this schedule reduces the protections that are afforded to victims of racial discrimination and racial hate speech by narrowing the scope of behaviour that may constitute offending conduct. Labor does not support that narrowing of scope and, by the amendments on the running sheet here, it is clear that the Australian Greens and the Nick Xenophon Team similarly will not support that narrowing.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We could spend hours more listening to this flowery language and debate about the principles of free speech and harassment, but these provisions have stood the test of time, of two decades. They have, as was highlighted earlier, the support, as shown by polling, of 80 per cent of Australians. This esoteric debate amongst members of the government should stop. Senators, in supporting Labor, the Australian Greens and the Nick Xenophon Team in opposing schedule 1, will stop this waste of the Senate's time that has been occurring this evening.</span>

                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Tasmania</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">22:09</span>):  As Senator Collins observed, the terms in which the Labor Party opposes schedule 1 is identical to terms that had been flagged and circulated by the Australian Greens and, for that matter, are identical word for word to terms that had been flagged and circulated by Senator Griff on behalf of the Nick Xenophon Team. This is the crux of the sad, sordid and sorry debate that has been going on in this country for far too long about section 18C of the Racial Discrimination Act. This is the Senate's opportunity to do the right thing. This is the Senate's opportunity to show that collectively we have listened to multicultural Australia and heard the abundant evidence given by multicultural Australia to the human rights committee, which conducted an exhaustive inquiry into section 18C of the Racial Discrimination Act. This is the Senate's opportunity to demonstrate that it has listened loud and clear to the people who have had the courage to stand up and talk about the racism that they have faced in this country. This is the Senate's opportunity, finally, to do the right thing and to end the push, at least for now, to change 18C in any way. This is the Senate's opportunity to stand up and say, 'We collectively refuse to take action that will make it easier to be racist in Australia.'</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Make no mistake: no matter what the intent and the motivation of people calling for this change—and I am happy to say I do not think everyone calling for this change genuinely wanted to make it easier to be a racist in Australia, although I am also happy to say I think some did genuinely want to make it easier to be a racist in Australia—the effect of weakening 18C would have been to send a message out into the Australian community that it is now easier to say racist things and be racist in Australia. That is a message that we cannot afford. There would never be a good time to make it easier to be a racist in Australia, but now would have been the worst time of all to make that change.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">So the Greens will proudly support this change—alongside the Australian Labor party and the Nick Xenophon Team and potentially alongside others, although they can, of course, speak for themselves—because we want to show that we have listened and that we are standing up for the magnificent, rich tapestry that is multicultural Australia—that tapestry that has underwoven so many beautiful and brilliant things in our community. It is a tapestry that has been a foundation for so much of the infrastructure that has been built in this country. It is a tapestry that enriches the life of every Australian. We so strongly support multiculturalism. It is a fundamental of the Australian way of life. In supporting this change, we will go proudly on the record as supporting those beautiful things and defending the protections that exist in current Australian law against racism.</span>

                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Queensland</span>—<span class="HPS-MinisterialTitles">Attorney-General, Vice-President of the Executive Council and Leader of the Government in the Senate</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">22:13</span>):  As Senator Collins says, we have had a long debate about this, and most of it is already on the record, so I will not detain the Senate for long, but can I just make a couple of observations on this division. I acknowledge that, in view of the position taken by a majority of the senators in this chamber, the change proposed by the opposition will succeed, and that will be a very sad day for this country, because, contrary to the pessimism about the Australian people that was so evident in the speech we just heard from Senator McKim, we in the government do not think that that is an either-or proposition. We do not think that Australia can have free speech or it can have multiculturalism but it cannot have both. We believe, on the contrary, that one of the great values of modern multicultural Australia is freedom, and that includes freedom of speech. It includes freedom of expression. It includes a healthy society which deals with difference and even deals with unpleasant and rebarbative opinions not by the processes of a vast state bureaucracy that acts almost like a thought police but the way a healthy society deals with such issues: through freedom of thought and discussion so that the kind of racist notions that Senator McKim evidently thinks are now going to cascade from the mouths of the Australian people will be dealt with by the Australian people themselves, by their disdain for such notions and such attitudes, without having to invoke a government agency to tell us what to think and say.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">You see, if there is one thing that fundamentally divides those on my side of this chamber and those opposite, it is the difference between optimism and pessimism. We are optimists about the Australian people. We are optimists about their decency, their goodness, their tolerance and their capacity to sort out differences in the way healthy societies do. Those opposite look at the Australian people through narrow eyes and they see incipient racists. They see all these negative attitudes which only section 18C is protecting Australia against. That dystopian view of Australia is utterly alien to us, the sunny optimists of the Liberal and National parties and those on the crossbench who support us. We in particular see that we can have a free, robust and healthy liberal democracy that values freedom of thought, speech and expression and a rich, diverse, magnificent multicultural society at the same time—that one does not compromise the other and that one does not exist at the expense of the other, the way Senator McKim and others seem to think.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">It is also a sad day because it means that, for the time being at least, this parliament has decided not to correct the error made in 1995 of not giving effect to the Human Rights and Equal Opportunity Commission's report on the elimination of racist violence in Australia, which did not recommend limitations on freedom of speech by the inclusion of 'offend' and 'insult' in section 18C of the Racial Discrimination Act but did recommend the inclusion of a prohibition on harassment. So, as a result of tonight, this law will continue for the foreseeable future in its distorted fashion, limiting freedom of speech to no good purpose while failing to deal with the much more serious matter of harassment. Australia, alone in the world, will have failed to come up with a set of racial discrimination protections which show that you can protect freedom of speech and you can prohibit racist conduct and that those two goals are not inconsistent but complementary to one another.</span>

                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">So let us have the division. I think, both by the quality of their contributions and, if I may say so in respect of some opposite, by the tone of their contributions, many people in this place have revealed themselves in these last few days.</span>

                    </a>  Chair, I merely make the point that whether the Australian Conservative amendments were going to be successful or not, the opposition did seek to jump the gun and move this as we were crossing the chamber to deal with the amendments on the list as they were scheduled. The two valuable amendments that I thought would be very important were the item that changed the incidence of harassment to constitute more than a single offence and the item that truth would be a defence.</span>

                    </a>  I understand that. I am just seeking whether I am still entitled to move the two amendments and whether they will have any impact on the bill should they be there.</span>

                    </a>  I rise on a point of order. Could we get some clarification on that? Given that schedule 1 has effectively been removed from the bill and the Senate has made its view about that schedule, I do not quite understand—and you may wish for the opportunity to take advice—the basis on which Senator Bernardi's amendments can be now moved.</span>

                    <span class="HPS-OfficeInterjecting">The CHAIR:</span>  As senators would be aware, the amendment sheet is circulated in the chamber so everyone is aware of what the amendments are. As senators will also be aware, it is the person that gets to their feet who gets the call. It was Senator Wong who got to her feet and moved that amendment which takes out schedule 1. I am told by the Clerk that, in the past, amendments such as yours, Senator Bernardi, have been moved but the practical effect is no longer there, because the schedule has been voted on, and the practice is that they not be moved. I will give you the call.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Government amendments (1), (2) and (8) are amendments that the government is moving to the original bill at the request of the Human Rights Commission. Amendment (7) follows discussions with the commission. Amendments (1) and (2) omit those provisions of the bill which would add two discretionary grounds to section 46PF of the Australian Human Rights Commission Act. Amendment (8) omits a mandatory ground of termination for unlawful discrimination complaints. Amendment (7) repeals the existing discretionary ground of termination for unlawful discrimination complaints so that the scheme of the act will be that the relevant ground of termination is the ground of termination now provided for by amendment (8).</span>

                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">If I can take you, please, to amendment (8), amendment (8) provides that there shall be a requirement that the president terminate the complaint where the president has formed the opinion that there is no reasonable prospect of the matter being settled by conciliation. We have heard a lot of talk—some of it erroneous—about the QUT students case earlier in the evening. But what Professor Triggs has said to me privately, and has said I think publicly, is that one of the reasons that case went for so long is that there was not a capacity to terminate the complaint at an earlier time or at a threshold stage.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The purpose of these government amendments to the bill, and of item 36 of the bill itself, is to add some provisions to the existing section 46PF of the Australian Human Rights Commission Act, and the way the provisions will work is to require the president, before embarking upon an inquiry, to form a preliminary view of the complaint. That is the effect of these amendments—in particular, amendment (7). If the president is of the view that there is no reasonable prospect of the matter being settled by conciliation, then the president must terminate the complaint then and there.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">That is a very sensible amendment. It means that the commission, which does not exercise a judicial function but a conciliation and complaint resolution function, nevertheless applies the same standard as the court would apply in summarily determining an action or a proceeding. It is very, very commonplace, as those familiar with the practice of the law know, that if an action is commenced and the defendant or respondent to the action wishes to argue that it has no reasonable prospect of success then an application may be brought to strike out the action on that ground so that parties are not dragged through the courts responding to unmeritorious complaints or unmeritorious proceedings.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Similarly, what this will do is, in a somewhat similar fashion and applying the same test, oblige the president to form a preliminary view as to the merits of the complaint. If the president arrives at the view that the complaint has no reasonable prospect of being settled by conciliation, the complaint is to be terminated immediately, just as in law an action would be struck out at an early stage. That will avoid the mischief that was seen in, among others, the QUT students case. It will mean that the president is not placed in the irrational position of having formed a view that the complaint is hopeless but, nevertheless, being obliged by the act to continue to inquire into it. That, I think, is a matter of common sense. All senators, whether with legal training or not, will perfectly well understand. If the president, who is the conciliator, forms the view that a complaint is hopeless, that it has no prospects, then it puts the president in a false position and indeed in an irrational position to, having formed that view, nevertheless proceed with the determination and disposal of the complaint after a process of conciliation. This amendment avoids that mischief. It also means that people will not be dragged through these processes in a way that is inappropriate, because people who are respondents to complaints that the president has already decided are hopeless should be free of the process immediately. That is the purpose of these government amendments, which, as I say, have been discussed with the commission. I commend them to the Senate.</span>

                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">
                    <a href="GB6" type="MemberSpeech">
                      <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Senator JACINTA COLLINS</span>
                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Victoria</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">22:42</span>):  It is clear to the opposition that Senator Brandis is, at this point in time, moving (1), (2) (7) and (8), and I can indicate for the opposition that we support (1) and (2) but oppose (7) and (8). If we could vote in a way that accommodates that different position, that would be helpful. I would also like to take this opportunity to address all of the government's amendments on HZ118. I think it will facilitate the process if I deal with our position in relation to all of those together.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Before I do so, some general comments about the government's amendments are in order. Some of these issues have been highlighted during the second reading debate and in the committee stage so far, but what senators need to be aware of is that, whilst the amendments are addressed in the Racial Discrimination Act 1975 and the Australian Human Rights Commission Act 1986, we have made clear Labor's steadfast opposition to the changes to the Racial Discrimination Act contained in the bill, which is what we have dealt with so far. Despite the critical importance of these proposed changes to our nation, the government has been in what can be described as a fairly obscene rush to drive them through this place. The bill was introduced in the Senate on Wednesday, 22 March, and was referred to the Senate Legal and Constitutional Affairs References Committee the next day. Labor wanted a more rigorous inquiry process and a report in May, but the government managed to get through its demand for the Senate to have a single morning of hearing last Friday. I say this in part because at least one senator on the other side said, 'No, that was weeks ago.' The committee had, as I said, a single morning of hearing last Friday at virtually no notice and then to report on Tuesday, 28 March, just two days ago. As I also highlighted, there were inconsistencies between the majority committee report and what, indeed, the minister indicated in his second reading speech. This highlights some of the concern about the process that has occurred here. It was an absolute disgrace that not only did the government-dominated Senate committee fail to call any Indigenous witnesses last Friday but when representatives of the Aboriginal Legal Service came to the hearing and asked to be allowed to speak the government members of the committee refused to allow them to be heard. It says all you need to know about how the government has managed this process and, indeed, what we are doing now at quarter to 11 on a Thursday night. It highlights the government's real views about freedom of speech that it would deny Indigenous Australians a right to be heard on the changes to antiracism laws it is trying to enact.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Yet, in even the few hours of those public hearings, it became clear that there are a number of serious problems with the procedural changes contained in schedule 2 of the bill, which alters the complaints-handling procedures of the Australian Human Rights Commission. In particular, those amendments as drafted could significantly increase delays and costs for complainants and those responding to complaints of racial discrimination. We can hardly be surprised that the government has hopelessly failed in drafting both schedules of this bill given that, once again, Senator Brandis has been behind this operation. This was the Attorney who declared his commitment to the right to be a bigot and whose last attempt to gut section 18C ended up in a smoking wreck in the last parliament.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The government has said that it will amend schedule 2 to deal with the many problems identified in evidence last week, but many of those amendments utterly fail to deal with the problems raised in evidence last week and, if implemented, would have the effect of creating a mountain of new red tape while increasing costs, increasing delays and denying access to justice for parties to complaints under discrimination law. Essentially, they would nobble the Australian Human Rights Commission.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">It is important to note that many of the ill-conceived changes to procedures of the commission contained in this bill will adversely affect not only those bringing complaints under section 18C, for race discrimination, but also thousands of Australians who are party to complaints for disability discrimination, sex discrimination and age discrimination. These changes go well beyond what the government has purported to be addressing.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Labor oppose government amendments (4) and (5) and (7) to (12). Labor have made clear from the outset of the debate that we support improvements to the procedures of the Australian Human Rights Commission. We oppose amendments (4), (5), (7), (8), (9), (10), (11) and (12) because these amendments do not serve the fundamental purpose for which this bill is being passed, because they have the effect of degrading the processes of the commission by adding red tape, adding cost, adding delays or otherwise impeding the important work of the commission. These amendments should never have been rushed through in such abject haste. The consensus, as I said, that was built by the Parliamentary Joint Committee on Human Rights is what should form the basis of agreed positions that should address in a more considered way the issues that have been put forward.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">That said, Labor supports government amendments (1), (2), (3) and (6). Labor is pleased to see that the government has chosen to implement some of the recommendations for reform to the processes of the Australian Human Rights Commission as recommended by the Parliamentary Joint Committee on Human Rights in its report, in February this year, on freedom of speech in Australia. It is particularly gratifying to see given that many of those changes to procedures were requested by the commission itself. While Labor is steadfast in its opposition to the gutting of the nation's longstanding protections against racist hate speech, which has been the government's primary purpose with this bill, Labor does support improvements to the procedures of the Australian Human Rights Commission—that is, those amendments that represent genuine improvements to the commission's procedures. Government amendments (1), (2), (3) and (6) to the bill are supported by Labor because they ensure that the bill more faithfully gives effect to the recommendations of the joint committee and the submissions of the Australian Human Rights Commission to improve the commission's procedures.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Amendment (1) is supported because it removes a provision that creates significant uncertainty and, like so many of the bill's provisions, shows in its original form a failure to understand the processes of the commission in conciliating complaints. It says a lot about the government's partisan and often belligerent mindset that it thinks a conciliation will be resolved in favour of one side or the other rather than to the mutual satisfaction of both parties. The removal of 22C II A in accordance with amendment (1) is therefore supported by Labor. The same arguments that I have just discussed apply to amendment (2), which we support for the same reasons. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Of course there are many potential problems caused by legislating in a rush. A constrained capacity to consult with key stakeholders is one of the challenges apposed to members of this Senate when the government is determined to deal with things in a hurry, as it clearly is with this legislation, but also a constrained capacity of all senators to consider all potential implications and potential unintended consequences of amendments that are before the Senate. </span>

I have seen it end in unintended consequences. I have seen it end in amendment bills being brought relatively rapidly back into the very parliament that legislated a matter in an unholy rush, because there simply was not enough time to adequately consider all of the implications of the amendments that, ultimately, were passed through that parliament. I am talking here about the Tasmanian parliament where I sat for a number of years. </span>

I hope that we are not going to fall foul of some of the things that I spoke about a moment ago such as unintended consequences or legislation that has not been able to be adequately considered. I do warn the Senate that the rush with which we are legislating is not good practice. It does increase the risk that there will be unintended consequences to the amendments that we pass. </span>

                      <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Senator BRANDIS</span>
                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Queensland</span>—<span class="HPS-MinisterialTitles">Attorney-General, Vice-President of the Executive Council and Leader of the Government in the Senate</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">22:55</span>):  Madam Chair, I want to address the suggestion that this debate has been rushed and or there has been a want of sufficient consultation with the Human Rights Commission. There have been no time limitations placed on this debate at all. We have had a very long second reading debate in which, by my count, at least 30 senators contributed. The bill which is under consideration is a short bill of some 20 pages. There are 12 government amendments to the bill. Those government amendments were distributed on Tuesday afternoon. Contrary to what has been said by Senator McKim, they are not of a particularly technical character. They are certainly not particularly difficult to follow.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">How it can be said that, after a debate which has not been limited in time on a bill of only 20 pages that was tabled eight days ago dealing with a small number of government amendments that were circulated two days ago, there has been insufficient time to consider, the matter escapes me. It just escapes me. And, of course, the issue that has attracted most of the attention, the amendments to section 18C of the Racial Discrimination Act, is an issue that has been the subject of very vigorous public discussion in this country few years. Now, we are dealing with procedural amendments—which is only part of the package. As I say, there has been plenty of time for a reasonably competent senator to absorb and consider their effects.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">In relation to the suggestion of a lack of consultation with the Human Rights Commission, I have been having discussions about these particular matters—the matters dealt with in schedule 2 of the bill about the commission's procedure—with Professor Gillian Triggs since I first came into the portfolio 3½ years ago. A detailed letter recommending certain changes which are adopted in some of these measures came to me from Professor Triggs as long ago as April 2015. We have had since then a very long inquiry by the parliamentary human rights committee, requested by me on 8 November 2016. It reported on 28 February 2017 and it held nine days of public hearings, which, on any measure, is a very long parliamentary inquiry. And that committee sat in every single capital city in Australia.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Again, how anyone can seriously suggest that there has been a lack of consultation when the government has been in discussion with the Human Rights Commission on some of these amendments for 3½ years and, more recently, the bill itself responds to a parliamentary inquiry that took nine days of hearings escapes me. I rather thought I might be chastised for being too slow, given that some of these amendments were formally requested by Professor Triggs in April 2015, rather than being chastised for being too rushed.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Rhetoric gets you nowhere in this business, but the facts are stubborn, and the stubborn facts are that we have been in dialogue with the Human Rights Commission about these and other matters for 3 ½ years, they come on the heels of a nine-day parliamentary inquiry and the discussion tonight comes after a long parliamentary debate on the second reading on a short bill. Those are the facts.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">With those observations to set the record straight from what has fallen from Senator McKim in particular and also Senator Collins, I commend the amendments to the Senate. I understand that the proposal is to put government amendments (1) and (2) together and then to put government amendments (7) and (8) together. Is that right?</span>

Minister, earlier this week an Orthodox rabbi from Melbourne, the capital of the state of Victoria, questioned me about the changes to 18C that we as a government are proposing and debating in the Senate tonight. He was concerned that racial abuse would be condoned and enabled by the changes being proposed. He gave me an example that, as an Orthodox Jew, obviously, particularly on the Sabbath he will be walking through the streets of Caulfield, often with his family, and that cars would drive past and racial abuse would be hurled at him. He was concerned that this type of behaviour would actually be encouraged by the changes that we are proposing. I was wondering what reassurance the minister could provide to the rabbi and members of the Orthodox Jewish community in Melbourne that the changes being proposed by the government will indeed strengthen these laws and ensure that that type of behaviour and harassment will not be able to occur on the streets of Melbourne.</span>

We have actually dealt with the 18C amendment, but nevertheless let me respond to your question. What the government wanted to do but has now not succeeded in doing is to strengthen section 18C by including what was missing from it, and that is the word 'harassment'. In the example you have instanced of the rabbi in Melbourne who was the subject of racial abuse by a passing motorist, plainly that would have constituted harassment. It may also have constituted intimidation depending on what was said and the violence with which it was said. It may well have constituted offence and insult—or humiliation, for that matter. So, in the particular case you instanced, certainly the rabbi's position would have been protected by the inclusion of the word 'harassment' that the government proposed. It would not have been weakened by the removal of the words 'offend, insult, humiliate', because the same conduct would have been caught by the word 'harass'.</span>

Let's just look at what has happened here. This bill was the subject of half a day of committee hearings during which the government members on the committee, who constitute a majority of the committee thanks to the chair being a government member and having a casting vote, denied the opportunity for the Aboriginal Legal Service to even appear at the hearing. So, if the Attorney is suggesting that this is not rushed, that claim does not stand up. I also want to respond to the little backhander that the Attorney could not help but give me on the way through, and might I, before I do that, say it is an absolute badge of honour to be attacked by Attorney-General Brandis.

Attorney, the evidence is clear: you are rushing this legislation. If you were not rushing it, you would not have had to bring in a dozen amendments to your own legislation this evening.</span>

                      <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Senator BRANDIS</span>
                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Queensland</span>—<span class="HPS-MinisterialTitles">Attorney-General, Vice-President of the Executive Council and Leader of the Government in the Senate</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">23:08</span>):  Senator McKim, I do not accept that. I was not specifically referring to you when I said that a moderately competent senator could have got across this legislation. I would not be surprised to find you have got across the legislation, Senator, but if the caps fits. The fact is that the report on which this bill is based, in large part at least, was tabled on 28 February and a bill was drafted, and as soon as the bill was drafted it was provided to the Human Rights Commission. That was done on Tuesday of last week when the bill was hot off the press. It was not provided to the Human Rights Commission, obviously, before it was printed. There was no delay in its provision to the Human Rights Commission. It was provided to them as soon as it was available and had been through the cabinet and the government party room on Tuesday of last week. Professor Triggs—who, of course, is herself a senior lawyer—and her staff went through the bill on Tuesday afternoon or Tuesday evening. We had a long conversation on Wednesday morning in which she made a few observations—helpful observations, as most of her observations are—and, as a result of that, the government took on board what she had to say and made a small number of amendments to the bill.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">That seems to me to be a description of proper process. How outraged would you be, Senator McKim, if I came into the chamber and presented a bill and you asked me was the Human Rights Commission consulted about this bill and my answer had been no? In fact, the Human Rights Commission was consulted about the parliamentary report during a long meeting on 3 March. Informed by both the parliamentary report and the discussion with the Human Rights Commission on 3 March, drafting instructions were given to my department. As soon as the bill was drafted and had gone through cabinet and the government party room, it was provided to Professor Triggs with an invitation to comment on the bill itself, which was responded to with alacrity by her. She was in a position to offer detailed comments on the bill the morning after it was provided to her. Those comments or observations were taken on board, and, as a result, a small number of amendments to the bill suggested by Professor Triggs were agreed to by the government.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I do not know how a process could have been more thorough than that. Consultation with the affected agency at every stage, and a readiness of the government to adopt the agency's suggestions during those consultations. That is not to say, and I do not say, that every suggestion Professor Triggs made was agreed to, because some of the suggestions she made went to issues of policy, as she acknowledged. But when it comes to technical matters, every suggestion on what I would call technical matters that Professor Triggs made was adopted. As a result, together with the government amendments, what the government puts to the Senate tonight in schedules 2 and 3 is a package that incorporates the government's views from a policy point of view about how the proceedings of the Human Rights Commission's complaints-handling process should be reformed—influenced and fine-tuned by Professor Triggs herself from a technical point of view—and, on top of that, a number of other amendments that did not arise from the parliamentary committee process, but were suggested by the commission in a letter initiated by the commission as long ago as April 2015. I would expect that Professor Triggs will be very happy to see schedules 2 and 3 passed by the Senate tonight.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Just to avoid any confusion, I have referred to 'schedules 2 and 3'. The only reason schedule 3 is separate from schedule 2 is that schedule 2 amends the Australian Human Rights Commission Act while schedule 3 amends the Native Title Act. It amends it only in a technical way—that is, by repealing section 209, which places an obligation on the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Social Justice Commissioner to present a report to the minister about certain matters, with a requirement that the minister may request a report and, of course, preserving at all times the capacity of the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Social Justice Commissioner to provide a report. That was another of the suggestions that came from Professor Triggs. So when I refer to the technical amendments in schedule 2 that were in fact the suggestion of the commission itself, I mean compendiously to refer to schedules 2 and 3. For brevity of expression, when I refer in this debate to schedule 2, please understand that I am referring to schedules 2 and 3.</span>

I thank the Attorney for the clarification that he made at the end of that contribution. I do understand the point he was making. Attorney, I do not want to get into a long tit for tat here. The simple fact is that it is a quarter past 11 on a day you had to bring an hours motion into this Senate to extend its usual sitting hours. Clearly, the government is in a rush to have this matter resolved one way or the other. You have lost the battle to change 18C, and it is a great day for multicultural Australia, as I mentioned earlier. The simple fact that we are here debating this legislation at a quarter past 11, with a another very significant bill still yet to be debated this evening according to the hours motion you brought into the Senate, quite frankly speaks for itself.</span>

                      <span class="HPS-MemberContinuation">Senator BRANDIS:</span>
                    </a>  There are two supplementary explanatory memoranda. It is the most commonplace thing in the world for there to be supplementary explanatory memoranda where there are government amendments. In fact, that is what the document is called. I table the supplementary explanatory memoranda.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Senator McKenzie, you asked me about what I have called the technical amendments. I have used that phrase essentially to describe amendments that were proposed on 7 April 2015 and subsequently by the Australian Human Rights Commission. Those amendments comprise items 6 to 9, 11 to 14, and 16 and 17 of the bill that will amend the commission's functions with respect to human rights and equal opportunity in employment functions. Complaints made under the commission's human rights and equal opportunity in employment functions cannot—unlike unlawful discrimination complaints—proceed to the Federal Court or the Federal Circuit Court for determination.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Items 6, 7, 11, 12, 16 and 17 will replace the mandatory duty for the commission to report to the minister with discretion to report to the minster. The commission currently has a mandatory duty to report regarding a human rights inquiry or an equal opportunity in employment inquiry. Where the commission finds the inquiry is made out and settlement is inappropriate or unsuccessful, these amendments will maintain the complainants and respondents as the principle recipients of the report, with the minister informed of major issues at the commission's discretion. That relieves a burden—an administrative and cost burden—on the commission by replacing a mandatory reporting requirement to the minister, where one is not strictly necessary, with a discretionary one. The amendments are intended, as I said, to reduce the administrative burden of mandatory reporting on the commission and the government which is imposed by reports that do not raise significant issues. I should stress that if a report does raise a significant issue then the commission would, as a matter of course, present the report to the minister.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The amendments will, at the same time, broaden the commission's ability to formally report to the minister, as the commission will no longer be limited to only report on complaints in which settlement was inappropriate or unsuccessful. There is absolutely no reason why there should be ministerial overnight or ministerial involvement in a complaint settlement procedure. That is the effect. It is a cost saving and administrative efficiency that will be achieved by these amendments.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Items 8, 9, 13 and 14 of the bill will introduce three new grounds by which the commission may close a human rights inquiry or an equal opportunity in employment inquiry. The commission will be empowered to close an inquiry where it is satisfied that the inquiry or the continuation of the inquiry is not warranted, that there is no reasonable prospect of conciliation or that there is no reasonable prospect of the matter being resolved in favour of the complainant. These amendments will allow the commission to expeditiously dispose of human rights and equal opportunity of employment complaints which are ill-conceived or vexatious. The government amendment currently before the chair changes the language from 'resolved in favour of the complainant' to 'successfully terminated', but that is an issue of fine tuning of language.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">But once again I am sure you will see, Senator McKenzie, the point of this: that it is in everybody's interests—in the complainant's interests, in the respondent's interests, in the commission's interests—that there should be an early identification of complaints that have no prospect of being conciliated. Now, there may be several reasons for that. It may be that the complaints are, on their face, hopeless. For example, the facts the complainant recites could not possibly constitute a breach of section 18C of the Racial Discrimination Act or a breach of any other relevant prohibition in other discrimination statutes. It may be that the intractability of the parties is such that the president can see immediately that they are not interested in conciliation and may pursue their remedies by application to the court. It may be that from a legal point of view the complaint is completely misconceived—for example, if it invokes as the legal ground of complaint a ground which is simply not available under the act, so that it is defective on its face.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">So if, for any one of a number of reasons, it is apparent to the president or to the commission that the complaint is bound to go nowhere, then it is in everyone's interests that it be terminated at once. It is in the interests of the commission, because it saves costs, and therefore it is in the interests of taxpayers. It is in the interests of the respondent not to be dragged through a pointless process. And of course it is in the interests of the complainant, too, because no-one wants complainants to have false hope if they are genuine complainants who have misconceived the act. And nobody wants to encourage vexatious complainants if they are vexatious complainants who, in a maliciously or vexatious way, try to game the system by invoking the Human Rights Commission in order to, as it were, pursue a vendetta—some people think that is what Cindy Prior did in the QUT students case—or for more mercenary reasons, shall we say. So, whatever the reason for the commission or the president to arrive at a view that the complaint is going to go nowhere, it is best that that view be arrived at earlier—at the earliest point in the proceedings—and that is what these technical amendments will do.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Then there are the amendments provided by items 18 through to 26, which will replace the duty of the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Social Justice Commissioner and the National Children's Commissioner to produce annual statutory reports, with the discretion to provide reports for the minister when the commissioners see fit. Those amendments broaden the commissioner's ability to formally report to the minister. Again, like items 6, 7, 11, 12, 16 and 17, they will no longer be limited to a single annual report and they will have a greater flexibility to manage priority work, ensuring that reports are produced as needed and when appropriate rather than annually. The commissioners may choose to continue submitting reports on an annual basis. However, that will no longer be mandatory.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Then there are some items in relation to the governance arrangements of the commission itself—in other words, the way the commission governs its own conduct and internal administration. One proposal, which was the result of a discussion between Professor Triggs and me and is what I might perhaps describe as a negotiated outcome, is item 3 of the bill. Item 3 of the bill deals with subsection 8(2) of the Human Rights Commission Act. It has always bothered me that subsection 2 of section 8 of the act should be there. Let me read it to you and you will see what is wrong with it:</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">(2)  The members must act in a way that promotes the collegiate nature of the Commission.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Those words might seem innocuous, but when you think about them what they appear to do is to impose a statutory obligation, or at least statutory pressure, on all the members of the Human Rights Commission to operate in a way that promotes what George Orwell might have called 'groupthink'. I know from my familiarity with the Human Rights Commission, from what I have been told about its mode of operation by individual commissioners in private conversations, that there sometimes is pressure for the commissioners all to arrive at a common view on various things.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">These are independent commissioners, they are independent statutory officers. They have different roles. There is a Disability Discrimination Commissioner, and Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Social Justice Commissioner, a Race Discrimination Commissioner, an Age Discrimination Commissioner, a Children's Commissioner, a Human Writes Commissioner, the president, and I think there is one other as well. For them to perform their defined statutory functions, most of them arising by the way under different acts of parliament, it is not necessary for them to have a common view. If I may say so, I think one of the vices of the human rights debate in Australia for too long has been this idea that there is a single, uniform, universal, incontrovertible, unchallengeable, common view of what human rights are. That, of course, is absolute nonsense. We have been debating human rights in this chamber for three days and it is very clear that we on this side of the aisle have a very different view about the nature and extent and importance of freedom of speech than those on the other side of the aisle. That is a rich variety of views about what are and are not human rights and what are the contents of individual human rights. Where rights are potentially inconsistent with one another—for example, how one person's freedom to do one thing needs to be balanced against somebody else's freedom to do something else—there is always potentially a controversy. That is what political philosophers spend their lives doing: thinking about and writing about the way in which human rights are understood from a philosophical point of view, and the way in which inconsistencies between different values are reconciled and accommodated. So I have always thought it was very dangerous to have an implied obligation in the statue for members of the Human Rights Commission to have a uniform view on what is an innately contestable subject.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">That was particularly evident when His Excellency the Governor-General, on the cabinet's recommendation, appointed the great Tim Wilson as an Australian human rights commissioner, in December 2013, who brought a breath of fresh air to the Human Rights Commission because he came from a classically liberal perspective and he was the only commissioner at the time who one would have regarded as having a classic liberal perspective on human rights. I think there were some people who were aghast that a person who did not share the common mindset of the then commissioners should join their number. But, as Professor Triggs said to me only a couple months later, having a different point of view in our councils has been, to use her words, 'a breath of fresh air'.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">So, subsection 8(2) of the Human Rights Commission Act I think is inconsistent with the idea that there should be a heterogeneity of views within the commission. There should be a vigorous contest of ideas about people, all of whom care about human rights but may have slightly different perspectives. That is why the bill, by item 3, repeals that provision and substitutes—and this is the product of a negotiation between me and Professor Triggs, but they are not the very words I would have chosen:</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">(2) The members must co-operate with each other to achieve common objectives, where practicable.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">So, rather than having to have a common view, they should cooperate and, where practicable, seek to achieve common objectives—which I think is a much healthier way for a statutory body, particularly a statutory body whose business it is to deal with innately controversial issues, to conduct itself. So that is the amendment in item 3 of the bill. Then there is an amendment in item 5, which Professor Triggs was particularly keen to have, which adds the words:</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">The President has power to do all things necessary or convenient to be done for or in connection with the performance of his or her functions.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Professor Triggs was concerned that, in terms of her own role or the President's own role as leader of the Human Rights Commission, her internal authority was not sufficiently made out by the pre-existing act, so that was a governance provision that Professor Triggs herself was very keen to see added to the act. I hope that is helpful.</span>

I sometimes think Senator Dastyari has missed his calling and would be a better circus acrobat that a senator, but be that as it may—I say that kindly, Senator, as an admirer of yours, in some respects, at least. But some contribution about the government's tax plan seems very remote from a discussion about the complaints handling procedures of the Australian Human Rights Commission.

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Amendment (3) would insert after item 27 of the bill, which amends subsection 46P(1) of the act, in subsection 46P(1B) the words 'as fully as practicable'. The effect of the amendment would be that, were these provisions to be enacted, the requirement upon a complainant would be that the complainant must set out as fully as practicable the details of the alleged acts, omissions or practices. The purpose of this amendment is to ensure that the burden cast upon a complainant in making his or her complaint or allegation to the commission is not so high that a strict reading of the words of the statute would make it impracticable for a complainant not fully informed of the details of the conduct about which he or she was complaining to bring a valid complaint. So we, as it were, lowered the bar, or the threshold, slightly so as only to require the complainant to set out details of the alleged acts, omissions or practices which are the subject of the complaint as fully as practicable. I can tell you that this addresses concerns of the commission raised with me by Professor Triggs, and has been requested by Professor Triggs.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Amendment (6) adds two subsections to section 46PF, which is consistent with the treatment of analogous sections elsewhere in the act. What it provides is that subsections 6 and 10 of section 46PF do not impose a duty on the president that is enforceable in the court because it is not appropriate that, for example, in a complaint settling procedure there should be, for instance, a capacity to sue the President of the Human Rights Commission or the commission itself for a mandatory injunction, but subject to a very important qualification in proposed subsection 12, which says subsection 11 does not effect a legally-enforceable obligation to observe the rules of natural justice.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This is one of the absolute cornerstones of these reforms—to ensure that, from top to bottom, the Human Rights Commission's act and the procedures of the commission are subject to the rules of natural justice. So by excising the exercise of the power under subsection 6 and 10 of section 46PF from a legally enforceable obligation, we nevertheless exempt from that excision the rules of natural justice to make it clear that at all times, including in relation to the exercise of powers under section 46PF(6) and 46PF(10), the president is subject to an obligation enforceable by the courts to observe the rules of natural justice.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">What this amendment is concerned with—amendment (10) that is—is to provide that complaints which are terminated under paragraph 46PH(1B)(b), which is what was inserted by amendment (8), will not be required to seek the leave of the court to make an application alleging unlawful discrimination. Complaints which are terminated because the President is satisfied there is no reasonable prospect of that matter being settled by conciliation will not be required to seek the leave of the court. This fully implements a recommendation of the commission. It is an aspect of a tightening up by the government of the circumstances in which parties can proceed from the complaint resolution processes of the commission to the Federal Circuit Court or the Federal Court. At the moment there is in general no limitation on the capacity of a party dissatisfied as a result of the complaints handling procedure of the commission to apply to the court and seek judicial review of that determination.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The government proposes that, as a general rule, applications to the court should only be by leave of the court. That will prevent the parties from gaming the system, using the courts is applicable vehicle for vexatious conduct but also focus parties on the fact that this is a conciliation process, not a judicial process, in which resort to the court ought not to be regarded as a matter that is usual or routine.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">However, there are certain circumstances in which the government has agreed with the commission that a requirement of leave to apply to the court should be exempted and that there should be an as-of-right access to the court. This is one of them so we give effect by these amendments to that proposal by the commission and amendment (9) is consequential upon amendment (10).</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The effect of government amendment (4) is to remove some words from section 46PF(1) of the Human Rights Commission Act. In the bill, we propose to substitute the existing 46PF(1) and provide for a new procedure. I might dwell on this for a moment, because this is one of the key reforms. In the bill, the proposal is to repeal section 46PF(1) and substitute these words:</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Section 46PH of the act is the provision of the act which sets out all of the grounds upon which a complaint might be terminated as a matter of discretion. What this new provision introduces is a threshold determination by the president so that, when a complaint is received, the president must consider whether to inquire into the complaint, having regard to the matters referred to in section 46PH.</span>

                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">It might be helpful to the Senate if I remind you of what some of the provisions of section 46PH are. Section 46PH is the section of the act which sets out the various grounds upon which a complaint can be terminated—for example, if the president is satisfied that the alleged unlawful discrimination is not unlawful discrimination; if it is out of time; if the president thanks that the complaint was trivial, vexatious, misconceived or lacking in substance; if there is another available remedy; and so on. There are nine different grounds upon which the president, under the existing act, has a discretion to terminate a complaint.</span>

                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Under section 46PF, as amended, we will now have a position in which the president is required, at the threshold, to consider the matters in section 46PH, and if the president arrives at the view that it is not warranted to inquire into the complaint for any one of the reasons set out in section 46PH, the president must terminate the complaint then and there. So we have gone from discretionary termination to mandatory termination, in circumstances where a certain conclusion is arrived at by the president.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The effect of government amendment (4) is to omit from paragraph (b) of proposed section 46PF(1) the words 'having regard to any of the matters referred to in section 46PH'. There is already, by paragraph (a), an obligation to consider whether an inquiry should be made having regard to the matters in section 46PH. Then in paragraph (b) it would be, 'if the President is of the opinion that the complaint should be terminated—to terminate the complaint without inquiry'. The repetition of the words 'having regard to any of the matters referred to in section 46PH' in paragraph (b) would appear to be unnecessary, given that paragraph (a) already directs the President as to the matters to which he or she must have regard in considering whether a complaint should be the subject of inquiry.</span>

As I understand it you were talking about your consultation with Professor Triggs on this matter. Could you indicate whether this is one of the technical amendments on which Professor Triggs or the Human Rights Commission agreed with you, or was this a policy difference? Does this give effect to a policy difference that you had with the Human Rights Commission?</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This amendment was proposed by the Human Rights Commission. You will recall that I explained last night that, as a result of government amendment (4) agreed to by the Senate, the procedure for the Human Rights Commission will now be that when a complaint is made the commission and the president must make what is in effect a preliminary judgement as to whether or not the complaint should proceed to inquiry. That preliminary judgement is made having regard to the various matters set out in section 46PH of the act. That is a mandatory requirement. If the president is of the view that the complaint should not proceed to an inquiry, the complaint must be terminated at that stage.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The effect of amendment (5) will make it clear that the president is not required to notify a respondent, a person against whom an adverse allegation is made or a person who is likely to be able to provide information relevant to the complaint until the president has decided to inquire into the complaint under section 46P(1). The view of the commission was—and the government accepts—that, given this new procedure, the notification to respondents or people against whom allegations are made should await the president's determination of whether or not an inquiry should proceed. There is no point in the president notifying a respondent or a person against whom an allegation is made in a complaint if the president has decided not to proceed to an inquiry into the complaint in any event.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">However, the amendment also requires that, as soon as the president has decided to inquire into a complaint, then he or she must notify that decision as soon as that is done. As well, the notification must occur if a complaint is amended to add a respondent after the inquiry has been embarked on, or if the president forms an opinion that a person is subject to an adverse allegation after a decision to embark upon an inquiry is made. This fully implements the commission's recommendation in relation to the way in which the notification procedure should operate once the Senate has accepted as a matter of policy, as it did last night, that this new complaints-filtering procedure should be a mandatory requirement.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Amendment (5) also defines adverse allegation under the act as it has been. A person who is subject to an adverse allegation in a complaint does not have a right to be notified of that fact unless they are themselves the respondent. The government took the view that this was a serious omission from the act from the point of view of natural justice. I know that the QUT students case has been very frequently referred to in this debate, but that case particularly illustrates the gap in the act at the moment. In the QUT students case, the respondents were not the students, at least in the first instance; they were the QUT itself. And the complainant made a complaint against the QUT that it had not provided to her sufficient protection against what she alleged—wrongly in the end, as it turned out—to be a racially motivated offence or insult.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The students who were alleged to have made the remarks at which the complainant took offence were the subject of allegations in the complaint, very serious allegations which could have caused them—had they been true, which they were not—reputational harm. Yet nearly a year went by before the students even knew that these allegations had been made against them in pending proceedings. I think it would affront anybody's sense of natural justice that you could be the subject of a serious allegation of which you are not even made aware. So the government amendments will include a requirement to notify not only the respondents but also any people against whom adverse allegations are made, even though they are not made respondents to the complaint.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">But amendment (5) will give a definition of 'adverse allegation' and will ensure that people are only notified of specific allegations made against them, rather than the broad details of the complaint. That is also a privacy measure, because a complaint may name many people and it may canvass many issues, only a few of which might relate to a particular person against whom an adverse allegation is made. For example, if a complaint were to make separate allegations against 10 individual people, then the notification obligation is only an obligation to notify the person against whom the adverse allegation is made of the allegation against him or her, rather than of the whole complaint itself, which would disclose the allegations against other people, which are arguably none of that particular person's business. That is something the commission suggested and the government thought was a very helpful suggestion. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Amendment (5) will also repeat the standard language in relation to the notification provisions, which provides for an exemption from the notification requirement to persons other than respondents, where it is not practicable to do so. Let us take an example in which a very general allegation were made against a class of persons that might number hundreds or even thousands. In those circumstances, it would not be practicable to notify all of those persons that they were members of a group against whom an allegation had been made. That is the purpose of amendment (5)—to make clear the way in which the notification procedure will work, to make clear that that which is notifiable is only so much of an adverse allegation as concerns the particular person who is the subject of the allegation, and to give the commission an exemption where it is not practicable to notify such persons.</span>

Indeed, the Human Rights Commission expressed concerns with respect to these matters. I should also indicate, as is highlighted in the running sheet, that this particular amendment conflicts with opposition amendment (1) and (3) on sheet 8134, with which we will be dealing later.</span>

                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Queensland</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">09:11</span>):  Firstly, might I take the indulgence in thanking the Attorney for the very clear and precise way he is presenting these amendments. I often find these processes quite complex and, can I say, Attorney, it has been very useful to listen to you articulate not only the impacts of the amendments but the reasons behind them. I, for one at least, want to place on the record my thanks. I have a lot of questions around this process, as I mentioned in my contributions yesterday. I was somewhat agnostic on the substantive changes to the wording, but the process has attracted my attention and I have a lot of interest. I have four or five questions, so it might be best if I deal with them one at a time, Attorney. Can I apologise in advance: you may well have reflected on some of these matters when I have not been in the chamber. I am happy to go and do independent research if I am taking up the valuable time of the Senate.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The first one is in terms of what might otherwise be referred to as a statute of limitations. There was the case with QUT—and I assume there is a statute of limitations; I am sure there is; I know there are some time limits on how the matter can be dealt with—but I am more interested in where a complainant might want to promote their complaint in the first instance. My question is how that statute of limitation might run in the event that, during the course of a preliminary reaction to a complaint by an individual against another, information were to come to light that might redirect the attention of the complaint to another party or parties. Does the clock start again on that issue? Secondly, if I happen to be the subject of the allegation personally, can I join somebody in the action myself in my efforts to protect my position? The burden of these questions, Attorney, is all about the time limits, the time frameworks that sit around this process and these process changes.</span>

It is not a very hard statute to navigate your way around, as is apparent from your command of it.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The answer to your question is this: under section 46PH(1)(b) of the Human Rights Commission Act, one of the discretionary grounds on which the president may terminate a complaint is if the complaint was lodged more than 12 months after the alleged unlawful discrimination took place. That operates in a discretionary sense as, in effect, a statute of limitations. By item 39 of the bill, the 12-month time limit is replaced by a six-month time limit and, as well, we have provided that the commission has a best endeavours obligation to finish its inquiry into any complaint on which it embarks within 12 months. This serves the policy reason of trying to ensure that there is a delay and these matters are dealt with reasonable dispatch. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Senator O'Sullivan, the short answer to your question is: it is not strictly speaking a statute of limitations but the time, within which a complainant needs to lodge a complaint, is six months rather than 12 months. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Secondly, you ask whether there is any basis for the enlargement of that limitation of time if, for example, facts come to light subsequently to it. As you would be aware—and I know you are not a legal practitioner but you are, plainly, from your days as a police prosecutor, a very skilful forensic person, as we have seen in Senate estimates—there are discretionary grounds. In fact, there is quite a body of law about the circumstances in which limitations of time may be excused by the courts in light of matters not known to a plaintiff or an applicant within the limitation period subsequently coming to light. The phrase the courts use is a 'material fact of a decisive character' subsequently coming to light. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">It is not nearly as formulaic in this act because this act, notwithstanding its complexity, does seek to promote an informal mode of dispute resolution. But, I can tell you, that although we have made certain of these section 46PH grounds of termination mandatory, the ground in section 46PH(1)(b)—that is, that a complaint is made after the prescribed period—is still discretionary, so the president still has a discretion, which he or she would no doubt exercise in a manner somewhat analogous to the way in which courts excuse compliance with limitation periods to receive complaints beyond the six-month period specified. </span>

That is continuing this morning, and it is being done because clearly the government does not yet have the numbers or the agreements that it is satisfied with in regard to the next piece of legislation that this Senate will debate, which of course is around tax cuts for the big corporates in Australia, which the Greens will not be supporting.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">So, we will be supporting this amendment, and just to break the mould a little bit, I would like to thank the Attorney for listening so closely to the concerns that the Human Rights Commission raised in regard to the notification requirements that the government was originally proposing in its amendment bill. The commission has been very clear all the way through that the obligation to notify a person who was not a respondent but who was the subject of an adverse allegation and in fact in broad terms was mentioned would have been likely to have been onerous in many cases. And as the Attorney has pointed out, in all likelihood there could be complaints to the commission where a person making a complaint or raising an issue with the commission could potentially include a very broad range of people—for example, all members of the government, members of a corporation or people at a particular workplace.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The explanatory memorandum is clear that this amendment is designed to reduce what otherwise, in the view of the Greens, would have been too onerous an obligation placed on the Human Rights Commission. So, the Greens have proposed an amendment, our amendment (4), which I will now flag that we will be withdrawing, and I will take care of that at the appropriate time. And we will be supporting this amendment as well as government amendments (9) and (10).</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I also want to address my remarks quickly to the QUT case, which the Attorney has mentioned, simply to point out that I, to an extent, agree with some of the comments that the Attorney made. That case was an outlier case. It went for a very long period of time. What I do want to place on the record is the view of the Australian Greens that the Human Rights Commission did act in good faith all the way through that case. They had a reasonable belief that the matter could be settled without the formal intervention of the commission. The Human Rights Commission have also said in evidence that they gave to the Legal and Constitutional Affairs Committee that they may have handled that matter differently had they had their time again. That related specifically to the notification issues which the Attorney flagged. So I think that is an acknowledgement by the commission that there were learnings to be had from that case. For what it is worth, I agree with the Attorney that anyone with a sense of natural justice would think that the notification matters ought have been handled differently in that case than they actually were. I do think that anyone who is potentially the subject of adverse submissions ought be notified of that as soon as reasonably practicable.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">However, be those matters as they may, and taking into account the commission's acceptance that they may have handled that matter differently if they had their time again, the amendment that we are currently debating and the amendments that will flow from the relevant parts of the Human Rights Legislation Amendment Bill will, I believe, assist in the delivery of natural justice through the commission's process. And, on that basis, as I said, we will support this amendment.</span>

That is fairly obvious—the inconsistency. Senator O'Sullivan is not filibustering, as I understand the term. He asked a question that is highly relevant directly about the act. I have seen a filibuster or two in my time in this place, Senator McKim. Nothing that fell from Senator O'Sullivan's lips this morning vaguely resembles a filibuster. It was a constructive contribution to a relevant issue directly within the legislation. I think it ill sits with you, of all people, Senator, who says the government is rushing the debate to try and put pressure on other senators not to contribute to the debate.</span>

                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Victoria</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">09:29</span>):  I too have questions about this amendment requiring the notification of all parties by the Human Rights Commission, but let me add one observation prior to that. It is also ironic for Senator McKim to accuse coalition senators of filibustering in a seven-minute speech to the Senate about an amendment on an issue which he has spoken about many times before. But perhaps Senator McKim is kindly assisting the government if he believes we are engaging in a filibuster, and I guess I should thank him for it.</span>
                </p>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Before asking my question about the notification of all parties, I note, just for the record, that the President of the Human Rights Commission, Professor Gillian Triggs, was giving a speech—last night, in fact—in Tasmania to the Bob Brown Foundation at a charge of $50 a head. I am sure that Senator McKim and Senator Whish-Wilson are sad that they were not able to get back home to Tasmania to listen to Professor Triggs's speech.</span>

                    </a>  Chair, on a point of order, time is short. Could you please draw the senator's attention to the question that is before the chair. We are discussing amendments.

                    </a>  Thank you, Madam Chair. I will of course do so. I was just noting for the record that Professor Triggs, who is the President of the Human Rights Commission and presided over the Human Rights Commission in its recent controversial cases, including the QUT case, saw fit to give a speech to the foundation of a recently retired senator, which, in my view, is quite political in nature and actually comes to the heart of the Human Rights Commission's failure to administer these cases.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">On the merits of the proposed changes, I want to ask—through you, Chair—the Attorney-General to explain why it would be necessary to require an organisation like the Human Rights Commission to act in a way that is procedurally fair to uphold the principles of natural justice. Shouldn't we expect a commission not to be required by law to do that? It would seem to me like a reasonable thing for people to do without any encouragement or direction. And why is it the case that it is necessary to require the commission to notify all parties? I would have thought that it would be logical and reasonable to notify all parties and it would be in fact quite wrong to withhold information from parties about a complaint that exists against them in the Human Rights Commission.</span>

                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Queensland</span>—<span class="HPS-MinisterialTitles">Attorney-General, Vice-President of the Executive Council and Leader of the Government in the Senate</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">09:32</span>):  Well, Senator, much as that might be your expectation, on occasions it has not been the reality, and so the government is specifically legislating to apply the rules of natural justice to the Australian Human Rights Commission.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">While we are addressing the subject, Senator Paterson, might I remind you what the rules of natural justice are. There are basically two. One of them is what is called the bias rule. Natural justice is a technical legal term, as well as a term that has an ordinary, common-speech meaning, and it is used here in its technical legal sense. The most important rule of natural justice is the bias rule, and that is: a person whose rights are being determined or deliberated upon is entitled to have that done by an unbiased tribunal or decision maker which is not predisposed either in favour or against him. People will form their own judgements about whether in all cases the Human Rights Commission has observed that rule, though I am bound to say that, for the race relations commissioner, Dr Soutphommasane, to be soliciting complaints to the Human Rights Commission arising from the Bill Leak cartoon, as it has been credibly alleged he did, would raise doubts in my mind as to whether he as a member of the commission was capable of being a person involved in the determination of those complaints. In fact, in the way the procedure works, the president conducts conciliations, but, nevertheless, for a senior member of the commission actually to be soliciting complaints to the commission would strike, I think, most people as being in breach of the requirement of objectivity and neutrality in dispute resolution. That is the first of the rules of natural justice.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The second of the rules of natural justice, at least in a technical sense, is what lawyers call the audi alteram partem rule. That is a Latin tag which basically means 'the right to be heard'. A person against whom an allegation is made has a right to be heard in their own defence. The breadth of the application of that rule may depend on the circumstances of the case. Certainly there is no doubt at all that a respondent has a right to be heard. Under the current arrangements of the Human Rights Commission, of course, a respondent does get to be heard in the complaints resolution process. But the particular vice which we are correcting here is the omission of any obligation on the commission to notify persons not respondents themselves but against whom allegations are made of unlawful conduct, to notify them of the fact of the making of those allegations against them and to give them a right to dispute the allegation against them and to be heard in their own cause. There is no such obligation in the Australian Human Rights Commission Act at the moment. That is an oversight, which even Senator McKim has acknowledged. It offends the second of the laws of natural justice, in my view. The government has moved, for the reasons I have explained, to correct it.</span>

                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Victoria</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">09:36</span>):  What a preposterous dissertation we have just heard. We have the Attorney-General throwing around allegations—credible allegations, he tells us—in this debate here and now. It is outrageous behaviour. We should have concluded this debate last night. We could easily have continued until 12.30 or one o'clock and have concluded this matter last night.</span>

                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I want to address Senator Brandis's strange description of the process that we have been going through. This process has been truncated. Just have a look at the Legal and Constitutional Affairs Legislation Committee report. There was insufficient time to work through these detailed and complex amendments. But that is not what has been occurring in this committee stage. What has been occurring in the committee stage is a repeat of what went on in the second reading debate. How many government contributions did we have in the second reading debate? I ask people to reflect on that. How many repetitious speeches were delivered according to the government's talking points? And then last night they came in here and started doing the same again in the committee stage. Anyone who understands parliamentary process—and I know the Attorney-General's understanding of these things is relatively limited—knows what is going on. Senator McKim has quite correctly called it out.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">But now it is deteriorating even more. It is deteriorating into a slanging match, attacks on individual senators and attacks on outside parties in respect of 'credible allegations'. The Attorney should look at himself. To stand in this debate and start talking about credible allegations with respect to senior office holders is not something that belongs in this chamber. He should desist, and so should other government senators.</span>

The senator has now directly reflected on me, suggesting that I am involved in filibuster activities here, when in fact I have a serious and personal interest in this. I would ask, at the very least, Chair, that you ask the senator to indicate to the chamber whether I am one of the people she is directing her comment at so that I then can respond in my own point of order.</span>

In suggesting that I was slurring him, which I was not—I was referring to all government senators and the nature of their contributions—it would be an interesting procedure for you, Madam Chair, to suggest that I should nominate one way or the other whether I am referring to Senator O'Sullivan. If the cap fits, as I think Senator McKim said earlier, then he should reflect on the contribution that I have made. If he wants to continue drawing out this vacuous debate—</span>

May I point out two things. Firstly, the only senators who have been attacked by others this morning have been Senator O'Sullivan, who was attacked by Senator McKim, and me, who was attacked by Senator Collins. No government senators have said anything ungentlemanly.</span>

It is no wonder the Australian people look or listen to what is happening in this place and tear their hair out at times. We are wasting their money. I call on the government to end this ceaseless filibuster, which is designed to give them a greater opportunity to get through their legislation, which basically proposes to deliver trickle-down economics into this country. The most disadvantaged people in Australia have had their hands out for years, waiting for a single drop to trickle down, and it is still not doing that. This government is shafting poor people in Australia. It is shafting young people in Australia. It should get on with its job of legislating—</span>

Our contributions have been both direct and relevant to the issues around this amendment. If the government were filibustering, and it is not, to that extent I would be entitled to extend our gratitude for your time contribution.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Attorney, I know that you treat this as importantly as we do. It was only last night, of course, that we were the subject of accusations that we should not sit late debating such important matters. I want to congratulate the government for having listened to that reflection from Labor and, having reflected upon it, made a decision to bring the process to an end last night so that senators could come back here refreshed and with their mind on the job. It would seem that that has not been the case for everybody, but it certainly was the case for me. I spent a lot of time last night—in fact, on a private level, I had difficulty getting to sleep as I reflected upon some of the very important issues around this legislation.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">On process, I want to confine this set of questions—as you know, I have a lot of questions and I will be back on my feet a lot of times, but I will try to package them. I want to talk about entities. My understanding in life is that if we reflect upon—and the law often qualifies this. If there is an individual against whom an allegation is made, or indeed a person or entity who makes an allegation, I am trying to explore exactly what latitude might exist in that and how these changes to process may have created a more efficient, fairer and just environment for this to happen. Attorney, let me just speak on that, and then I will leave it up to you to reflect and perhaps to help me come to understand some of these issues. I suppose I will pose it as a question around a person or, indeed, a corporation, a trust, a foundation, a proprietary limited company or some other commercial construct where in one form or another there is more than one individual who has an interest in the conduct of that entity—or whoever may represent them, a chair or a trustee. Is every one of those iterations of constructs entitled to make a complaint and can that complaint be directed, in a mirror image, at corporations, foundations and so on at the other end?</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I will wait to hear from you on that, because your answer to that will give rise to a whole series of questions about how these processes might impact on the transfer or assignment of these matters or on where that collection of individuals who make up, for example, a trust might or might not want to join an action. They might, notwithstanding the democratic exercise by the trustee, and some may wish to settle and others may not. I will wait for your reflections on my first question and then come back and unpack it entity by entity and person by person, if that is alright and with the indulgence of the chamber.</span>

                    </a>  After more than 10 hours I will take that objection, Senator Gallagher. The Labor Party, which has spent all yesterday and in fact the entire second reading debate saying that the government was not allowing enough time for the debate, has tried to gag the debate, and failed. So that is how genuine the Labor Party is when they complain that the government has not allowed enough time. In fact, we have allowed an unlimited period of time and the Labor Party and the Greens themselves have tried to gag the debate.</span>

                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Senator O'Sullivan, you asked, as usual, a very relevant question that is directly related to the bill—unlike that which has fallen from Senator Collins's lips during the course of the morning—and that is whether entities as well as persons may be either complainants or respondents to a complaint, to which the answer is that it would be quite difficult, I think, to imagine that an entity would be a complainant. But it is theoretically possible, at least. Don't forget that what we are dealing with now is the complaints handling procedure of the Human Rights Commission. This is not only about complaints made under the Racial Discrimination Act; it is about all complaints made to the Human Rights Commission under any of the discrimination laws it administers. Those include, among other things, the Age Discrimination Act, the Disability Discrimination Act and the Sex Discrimination Act. So, let us say, for instance, that an aged care provider were for whatever reason alleged to be in breach of the requirements of the Age Discrimination Act, or let us say an institution like a school or a hospital or something were alleged to be in breach of the requirements of the Disability Discrimination Act, then, of course, that corporate entity could be the subject of a complaint of discrimination, which would go through the complaint handling procedure we have been discussing this morning. So, an entity can certainly be a respondent. Theoretically, an entity can be a complainant, too, because the act operates upon a complaint initiated by a person aggrieved, and a 'person aggrieved' is a defined term. As you would know, Senator O'Sullivan, the law recognises three sorts of persons: natural persons; bodies corporate, like a company; and bodies politic, like, for example, the Commonwealth of Australia. The way any reference to the word 'person' in an act of parliament would be read would be as to any legal person, whether a natural person, a body corporate or a body politic, that is able to approach the courts. Nevertheless, it is, I think, difficult to imagine that a person other than a natural person might be a complainant here.</span>

It relates to why it is so important that all parties who are named in a complaint are notified by the commission that there is a complaint against them. I want to make particular reference to what happened in the QUT case, where a complaint was made to the commission, and the commission held onto that complaint for a period of 14 months before notifying the students who were named in that complaint that there was a complaint that existed against them. I am interested in knowing why it would be important for those students to know earlier in that process and on equal footing with other parties that there had been a complaint made against them. How would they have been better placed to represent themselves in this case and how might this case have proceeded more smoothly had the students been aware from the very beginning of the case of the existence of a complaint against them?</span>

It is good to see you back in the chair. A very competent chairman you were, if I may say so—one of the best I have ever seen. Professor Triggs said in evidence the other day that the QUT students complaint could, on reflection, have been better handled. I think those were her words. When a statutory officer says to a Senate committee, 'This could have been better handled,' I think that is a discreet and gracious way of confessing that it was a complete shambles and a disgrace. The fact that four teenagers were the subject of an allegation made against them that they were racists and for 14 months they were not even alerted to the fact that a serious allegation against them was being considered by a public body was a disgrace. Professor Triggs conceded that they should have been notified much earlier in the process. That is why we have introduced the natural justice explicit requirements that I have mentioned and that is why we are considering amendment (5), to require people against whom allegations are made to be notified of them as soon as they are made. Once the commission has embarked upon an inquiry, then, from that moment on, any person against whom an allegation is made is entitled to know about it as soon as the allegation is made. </span>

                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">That is also why we have inserted in item 36 of the bill a new subsection (10) of section 46PF. Section (10)(b) requires the president to use his or her best endeavours to finish dealing with the complaint within 12 months after the complaint was referred to the president. At the moment, there is actually no limit as to how long the commission can take in dealing with a complaint. We have put in a 12-month period, but, in order to accommodate the wishes of Professor Triggs, whose contribution to the preparation of these amendments has been very helpful and constructive—Professor Triggs pointed out to me that it may, in a particular case, not be possible to bring the complaint resolution proceeding to an end within 12 months, given the complexity of the matter or various other circumstances, so there is no absolute deadline, as it were, that complaints must be dealt with within 12 months. It is expressed within the bill as a 'best endeavours' obligation. That would have certainly arranged—</span>

                    </a>  Thank you very much, Mr Temporary Chair. That would certainly have made a very big difference to the QUT students in two ways. Firstly, they would have known immediately that they were the subject of this vicious and false obligation, and they could have done something about it. They could, for example, have approached the commission to say, 'We have received this notice that we are the subject of this untrue allegation, and we wish to controvert it,' so they would have been in a position to protect their rights at once. And, secondly, the obligation on the commission not to proceed at a leisurely pace but to have the matter brought to a conclusion much sooner would have been, presumably, observed. Of course, in the QUT students case, it would not have even got that far because, plainly, Cindy Prior's complaints were so lacking in merit and so specious that I think, under this bill, it is likely that they would have been eliminated at the threshold and would not have been the subject of an inquiry at all.</span>

                    </a>  I will just finish, Chair. For people watching here today in the chamber or watching the broadcast, it is very important to put this into context. We have debated this—my colleague Senator McKim has done an excellent job on this over the last two days—for nearly 48 hours. We were kept here till after midnight last night. My son has his first football game on Saturday morning, which I am unlikely to make now. This is very important. We have been kept here. It is costing hundreds and thousands of dollars if not a lot more than that. That is taxpayers' money at a time when your government is cutting funds to pensioners, to Newstart, to single parents. What about the half a million dollars that could be going to those people in this country who need it?</span>

                    </a>  I will finish in 30 seconds, Chair. My point is this. We know you have backroom negotiations going on with Senator Xenophon and others to try and get through your company tax cuts, which this Senate has made very clear it will not pass. At a time of inequality, a time when we should be raising revenue, I have two questions to you, Attorney. How much is it costing the taxpayer for us to stay here and debate this nonsense this morning? The second question is: given that it is unprecedented in my time in the Senate to see government senators asking their own minister questions, when will you put the question so we can vote on it?</span>

We have been here since nine o'clock this morning, and I have been keeping a careful note of the questions that have been asked of me about the government amendments which I have moved. With the exception of one question from Senator McKim, the only questions I have received in relation to government amendments have been questions from Senator O'Sullivan and Senator Paterson. Every other contribution that has come from the opposition and from the Australian Greens have had nothing whatsoever to do with this bill. You say, Senator Whish-Wilson, 'How much is this costing and why are we having this debate?' The government senators are asking questions about the bill and every contribution that has come from you and your colleagues and the opposition has had nothing to do with the bill. So it little lies in your mouth, Senator Whish-Wilson, to complain that we should not be here. Let us get on with the debate. If you have some questions about the bill, ask them.</span>

                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Victoria</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">10:15</span>):  When Senator Whish-Wilson began his contribution by talking about goats, I thought we were about to be treated to a treatise on the views of one of the founders of the Green Party, Mr Peter Singer, on relations between goats and humans, but fortunately we did not go down that path. I am greatly touched by the Greens' new-found concern for wasting taxpayers' money. I look forward to seeing that reflected in their votes in this place. For as long as I have been here, I do not think I have seen the Greens vote for a reduction in the expenditure of taxpayers' money, but perhaps that is now about to change.</span>

                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I will come to my question on the bill itself. Unlike the others who have been asking questions not relating to the bill, my question is about the notification amendment that we are considering before us. Attorney, during the human rights committee's hearings into this matter, we heard evidence from the Human Rights Commission that one of the reasons it chose not to notify the students was that a request had been made to the Human Rights Commission to not notify the students. They identified that that request came from two parties. It originally came from the lawyers on behalf of Ms Prior, the applicant in the case, and it also came on behalf of the Queensland University of Technology, a co-respondent in the case. My question is: is it appropriate for a body such as the Human Rights Commission to acquiesce to a request from either an applicant or a co-respondent in a case to prevent notification of other respondents to the case?</span>

                      <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Senator BRANDIS</span>
                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Queensland</span>—<span class="HPS-MinisterialTitles">Attorney-General, Vice-President of the Executive Council and Leader of the Government in the Senate</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">10:17</span>):  Senator Paterson, the Human Rights Commission, in dealing with the QUT students case—and, as mentioned before, Professor Triggs has acknowledged that it could have been handled better—was somewhat constrained by the legislation under which it operated at the time. That is why we are having this debate, or at least some of us are, this morning about the procedural reforms that the government is proposing. The procedural reform of the commission has been done at the urging of Professor Triggs. She has not endorsed everything the government proposes, but much of what the government proposes she has done and, where there has been a policy difference, as I said before, we have done what we can to accommodate Professor Triggs's views.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">As to whether or not the Human Rights Commission should have yielded to the submission from the applicant, Cindy Prior, or the QUT not to notify the students, I would have to know the basis upon which that application to the Human Rights Commission was put, and I do not. But the important point, Senator Paterson, is that there was no obligation under the act to notify the students. So it cannot be said that the commission was in breach of any obligation under the law not to notify the students—it had no obligation to—but the injustice to the students of that position is manifest and that is why, ultimately, a decision was made after some 14 months to tell them that these serious allegations had been made against them. The effect of the amendments that we agreed to last night, and of this amendment, government amendment (5)—and of the bill itself of course, the new provisions which will add additional subsections to section 46PF of the Australian Human Rights Commission Act—will be to ensure that, in similar circumstances, that could never happen again. If Cindy Prior, the unmeritorious complainant in the QUT students case, made allegations in a proceeding against the QUT saying that students X, Y and Z engaged in conduct in breach of section 18C of the Racial Discrimination Act then, under the reforms the Senate is dealing with today, from the moment the president, having assessed the complaint as one worthy of inquiry, made a decision to conduct an inquiry then he or she—she at the moment, of course—would have an obligation to notify the people who were the subject of the allegation of the fact of the allegation having been made against them and the terms in which the allegation was made.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I think that even Senator McKim, who is no friend of the government by and large on these issues, conceded in his one relevant contribution this morning that it was consistent with natural justice. That should be so, and that is why, no doubt, we see the social warriors of the Australian Labor Party opposing this amendment. Something that even the Australian Greens concede to be a just way of dealing with a complaint is still being opposed by the Labor Party, but that is the Labor Party for you.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I hope I have answered your inquiries, Senator. I wish I could be more helpful. I do not know the particular reason why the president made the decision she did because I do not know what submissions were made to her on behalf of Ms Prior or the QUT. She certainly did not act unlawfully in not notifying the students, but under these provisions she would have to.</span>

                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Victoria</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">10:26</span>):  I have a further question about the notification of all parties and the importance of doing so. In my memory of the QUT case, there were two very unsatisfactory elements. The first was that, for 14 months, the existence of a complaint against the students was unknown to the students because the Human Rights Commission chose not to inform them. The second was that the students were given extraordinary minimal notice in order to participate in a conciliation conference about that complaint. From my memory of the committee process and the evidence that we heard, I believe that only two out of the seven students accused were able to attend the conciliation. Given that they were only given, I believe, again from my memory, two business days in order to prepare for the conciliation, it was not only difficult but also, in the case of at least one student, not possible to arrange the legal representation that they had a right to have.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">My question to the Attorney is this: obviously this issue would overcome the 14-month failure to notify the students, but will this amendment also overcome the issue of incredibly short and unfair notice given to the students prior to the conciliation conference to ensure that they have the capacity to fairly represent themselves and, if they so wish, to seek legal representation at the conciliation conference?</span>

But, I think as a matter of common sense, anybody can make their own judgements about the fairness of that.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The answer to your question, Senator Paterson, is that this amendment does not require a minimum notice period to be given for participation in a conciliation period. I just sought confirmation from those who advise me, and these amendments, and the act itself, do not provide for a minimum notice period for those invited to participate in a conciliation conference. That could have been done. We have tried to keep the procedures of the commission reasonably flexible but not as flexible as they were. We have imposed certain mandatory requirements, as you would have heard from the debate last night, but we have not made that a mandatory requirement.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The one thing I would say though is that, as I said before, we have made it very clear that there are natural justice obligations at every stage of this process. I was telling the Senate before about what lawyers regard in a technical sense as the rules of natural justice. The second of them, the audi alteram partem rule, is the rule that says you have got a right to be heard. The courts have held—many have explored, in numerous cases, what that means in a practical sense, and one of the things that it means is—that, if you have a right to be heard, it means you must be given a reasonable opportunity to be heard, which means, in turn, that you must be given a reasonable opportunity to prepare and present your case. I know that that is not a fixed deadline or obligation but, nevertheless, if there were a situation in which a person against whom an allegation were made was summoned to a conference or invited to attend a conference and they were able to say, reasonably, 'Well, you've only give me two days' notice; I'm not in a position to appear in two days' time; I need to understand the allegation that is made against me; I need to seek legal advice and I need to prepare my defence, and that is going to take me more than two days,' then failure to observe that reasonable request for a reasonable amount of time would be a breach of the rules of natural justice, and, because the commission is answerable by enforceable legal proceedings to observe the rules of natural justice, it would be at least theoretically possible, I suppose, for a person in that position to move in the court for an injunction to restrain the conciliation proceedings from taking place in a way that was in breach of the rules of natural justice.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I think that, in a practical sense, that would never happen, because I do think the commission would try, in circumstances like that, to accommodate the students, or somebody in the position of the students, although, plainly, that did not happen then. So that is the answer, Senator Paterson.</span>

                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Victoria</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">10:31</span>):  Your answer, Attorney, on that has prompted me to remember another issue in the QUT case that I wanted to ask you a question about. It was, in fact, the case—and we learnt during the committee hearing process—that the commission was aware that the students had minimal notice, and we know that because there are emails between lawyers that were acting on behalf of QUT and the commission, and there was a file note of a phone call between lawyers for QUT and the commission made by a commission investigator or conciliator who was looking after the case. The lawyers for QUT brought to the attention of the commission that the students had had very minimal notice of the conciliation and wondered whether in fact the conciliation should proceed, given that, and wondered whether the conciliation could proceed, given that actually not all of the students were able to be notified; of the seven students identified, not all of them were able to be notified prior to the conciliation. The commission, though, decided to proceed with the conciliation, and it stated in documentation that its reasons for proceeding were essentially that travel plans had already been organised and that they would be difficult to rearrange and that they wished to proceed with the conciliation. Is this another example of the commission failing to observe the principles of natural justice and procedural fairness, and is this more evidence that the government's amendments to require the commission to abide by those principles are necessary?</span>

                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Queensland</span>—<span class="HPS-MinisterialTitles">Attorney-General, Vice-President of the Executive Council and Leader of the Government in the Senate</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">10:33</span>):  Well, of course, Senator Paterson, the point is that, the way the act is currently written, the students had no explicit right to natural justice—that is the problem which Senator McKim himself identified. They were not respondents to the complaint. And, for the benefit of those who did not hear the earlier debate, let me just explain again that, in the QUT students case, the principal respondent was not the people whose conduct was complained of but the QUT itself. One of the QUT staff, an unlamented person called Cindy Prior, made what, in the end, turned out to be a vexatious complaint against the QUT. Perhaps she thought the QUT had more money than the students. But the substance of the complaint was the allegations against the students. So they were not the respondents. They were not parties on the record, as it were.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The way the act is currently written, those students had no right to be told, no legally enforceable right to be told, that these allegations had been made against them, and therefore they were not, strictly speaking, persons to whom natural justice obligations extended. But, for all the reasons I explained before—and I do not want to detain the chamber, so I will not say them again—it is very unfair that that should happen. That is why we are putting into section 46PF these provisions requiring that people who are the subject of adverse allegations be notified of them and be notified of them in a timely manner. Because we have put that into the act, such persons do have rights, including the right to natural justice, in the complaint being dealt with. Your question, if I may say so, Senator Paterson, exposes a very, very important gap in the act as it was exposed by that particular case, and the parliament has chosen, particularly by the amendment we passed last night, government amendment (4), to repair that gap.</span>

                      <span class="HPS-MemberContinuation">Senator O'SULLIVAN:</span>
                    </a>  Thank you, Mr Temporary Chair. The heart of this is that we on this side of the chamber are not bound, like a mob of sheep, to all go in the one direction at the one time, so I want to place on the record that I am keenly interested to understand these amendments. I am keenly interested to get in behind them, as are millions of Australians who are listening—millions. This is an effort on my part to come to understand them so I can make a decision as to whether or not I support them. It is highly likely, in fact even probable, that I will support them because of the confidence I have in the Attorney-General and his staff and those who have drafted this material. I find their work, normally, flawless. Nonetheless, unlike those on the other side of the chamber, the Greens-Labor coalition, I will put these amendments to the test to come to understand them on behalf of my constituency and on behalf of people who have been seriously affected. That ends that, and I thank you for the liberty, Mr Temporary Chair.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Attorney, it seems evident from the reaction from Labor and the Greens that they do not really understand the QUT case, so it might be useful if I just—and I know for some this is a bit repetitious—go across my knowledge of the QUT case from start to finish before I arrive at a question to you that has come to mind. My understanding is that we had these students at this educational facility who endeavoured to access a chamber within the university and were denied access after a qualifying question with respect to whether or not they were Indigenous. I must say, even though my knowledge of this matter was belated, I too was surprised, as they evidently were, to learn that there was some prerequisite for access in a learning institution in this nation based on whether you were Indigenous; indeed, that the same could be applied to ethnicity, gender, religion and so on—all those things that we on this side would find absolutely abhorrent. Attorney, you should be credited with responding in a careful and measured method. Despite the contributions from others, I am personally grateful that you have allowed this slow and steady chance for us to examine the detail of these cases.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">You might notice that, unlike others in the chamber, I am not laughing or knitting. I am taking this very, very seriously on behalf of these people—through you, Chair—whose lives have been seriously affected by this. I have to tell you that their offence will be refreshed if they are watching these proceedings today to find the giggling and laughing that is going on in the Greens. That is a reflection of the interest of the Greens in these matters. They are more interested in going to a soccer game tomorrow morning than they are in bringing about a careful consideration of very, very significantly important legislation in this place.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">At a personal level, I want to make a confession about myself. Sometimes, on impulse, I say things that perhaps I should not. I have, it has been said, been known to offend and insult people. So I have a personal interest to see that this process does reflect natural justice in that I may find myself in circumstances in the future.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">These students, with no direct knowledge themselves, went about their lives oblivious to the fact that events were occurring. They were events that, had natural justice been in play for them, would have probably created an environment where they may have participated in this process that was eventually going to affect them. We all know—Attorney, you know this from your broad experience in the law—that early intervention in some of these matters by a person who is the subject of allegations can often be important for them and impact on whether they are successful in defending their good selves in the course of the process. Memories of what was said become frail over time. In circumstances such as this, the nuance in a conversation could be lost.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The High Court has spent many, many dozens of hours debating the impacts of the word 'a', 'the' or 'there'. If you are the subject of these allegations and you do not learn about it for 14 months and you have to draw upon your memory of a conversation that occurred in what you have to say and evidence you have to present and that could impact positively or negatively on your circumstances, it is most important. That is why one of the conditions of natural justice and fairness is that individuals who are to be the subject of any judicial or quasi-judicial process is an ability to prepare and defend themselves at the earliest opportunity.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This was the circumstance, as I understand it, for the students. These students have had to be represented on a pro bono basis. I place on the record the thanks of all fair-thinking Australians to those lawyers, solicitors and barristers in Queensland who have come to the defence of these young people. The Attorney said yesterday that it reflected some of the higher principles of the practice of law, and I would have to agree with him entirely. Can you imagine circumstances where that might not have been the case? We could have had, as I reflected on last night, Kramer v Kramer. We could have had a justice system funded by the Commonwealth defending a matter brought by the Commonwealth in circumstances where, as we know, at the end of the day there was zero merit in the entire process. It would have been hundreds of thousands of dollars but, significantly more importantly, in my view, it would have been a distraction for the resources of very, very important bodies such as the Human Rights Commission being involved in these matters when they most probably have better things to be doing with their time.</span>

                    </a>  I will take that interjection. I thank you for that. The fact of the matter is that I take this very, very seriously. I personally take this very, very seriously, notwithstanding that others do not. If there are senators in this chamber who have no interest in this, Temporary Chairman Marshall, you should invite them to go back to the comfort of their suites. Let them go back to their offices and put their feet up. They can watch Sky News. I will not be intimidated by them. I will not be bullied by their interventions and interjections. I will continue, in a slow and methodical method, to examine all aspects and details of these amendments until I can fully understand it and make an informed decision on behalf of these people whom you have no regard for: future students from QUT, and future media representatives who have the courage to make statements, either through an expression of art or indeed in a public debate.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Attorney, I want to focus now on the issue of vicarious liability in these circumstances. Let us assume, as was the case in QUT, that QUT themselves were the first body that was the focus of the Cindy Prior complaint. We know, from what I have just informed the chamber, and other contributions have identified this, it evolved to affect these students. But in the event that the behaviour of, let us pretend, students at a university was the subject of a complaint against the institution, what happens with that—how it is resolved and the decisions made—impacts on all of the parties. My question is: let us pretend that an institution is the subject of a complaint and it decides to take—</span>

                    </a>  Attorney, my reflection is that the decisions taken by this institution may positively or negatively impact in a case where, say, there are three students involved. So I am talking about this vicarious relationship. Let me put you that, perhaps, the students want to take a particular course to protect their interests and the institution wants to take another. Their lives are intrinsically bound together because of the circumstances of the event, where indeed the students may not be a direct party to an action. But the institution's decision, if it were to take, for example, a commercial decision to settle, perhaps on confidential grounds, which, to some minds who do not exercise fully the commercial senses that surrounds some of these things, might be seen as a capitulation or an admission in relation to the action that has been brought. So, with these procedures I am keenly interested in knowing what protection either the institution or the students may have in their own personal interest or interests in the event that one or the other decides to take a course of action that is inconsistent with the ambition or intent of the other party.</span>

                      <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Senator BRANDIS</span>
                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Queensland</span>—<span class="HPS-MinisterialTitles">Attorney-General, Vice-President of the Executive Council and Leader of the Government in the Senate</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">10:49</span>):  I will explain how this relates to amendment (5), which is the question before the chair at the moment. You see, question 5 is about the circumstances in which people who may not be respondents but against whom allegations of unlawful conduct are made are entitled to receive notification of the fact of the making of those allegations, how soon they are entitled to receive it and what limitations are placed on the obligations of the commission to notify them, which does seem to be fairly squarely what Senator O'Sullivan is inquiring into.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">So, Senator O'Sullivan, the point you make, as I understand it, is this: that where a complaint is made of the kind that was made in the QUT students case there are potentially inconsistent interests—how those inconsistent interests are to be dealt with and reconciled. In fact, there were inconsistent interests between the QUT and the students in the QUT students case, and that is manifest from the fact that the lawyers acting on behalf of the QUT actually wrote to the Human Rights Commission and asked that the students not be notified. I have a lot of affection for QUT, I might say; I have never been a student or a lecturer at QUT, but I have a lot of affection for it and I hold the vice-chancellor in very high esteem. Nevertheless, I think it was a poor decision of those who managed the matter from QUT to ask for the students not to be notified of the fact that allegations of unlawful conduct had been made against them, and the fact that was done shows plainly there was an inconsistency of interests between QUT and the students.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Let us remind ourselves what happened here. Some students at QUT—in particular, Alex Wood, Calum Thwaites and Jackson Powell—went into a computer lab on the premises of the QUT and they were told by a woman called Cindy Prior, who evidently was an Indigenous person, that they had no business being there because they were evidently not Indigenous people and this was an Indigenous computer lab, so they were kicked out. Later that day Alex Wood put up a Facebook post that said:</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">Just got kicked out of the unsigned indigenous computer room. QUT stopping segregation with segregation?</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">And Mr Powell posted on his Facebook page:</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">I wonder where the white supremacist computer lab is.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">And it was alleged that Mr Thwaites had said something, which he has denied saying, and it has never been established that he did.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">So, regarding the two operative statements which caused this enormous fuss, some might think that the statement by Mr Wood—'Just got kicked out of an unsigned Indigenous computer room. QUT stopping segregation with segregation?'—was a reasonable point to make. They might think that was a perfectly reasonable point to make—that you do not stop segregation by segregation. And Mr Powell, a lit bit more pointedly, said, 'I wonder where the supremacist computer lab is?'—again, making a pointed remark about the unusual nature of the arrangements at QUT that reserved a particular space, a particular facility, for students only if they were Indigenous. I have no comment to make about the policies of the QUT, but I think most Australians who learned of this case were very surprised—and these were the only relevant facts, by the way—that such remarks, made by teenagers on a Facebook post, could have caused such a fuss.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">But such a fuss they did cause, and these students were the object of persecution. They were the object of persecution through the processes of the Human Rights Commission, which we are gathered here today to reform. And we will have done a very good day's work, Senator O'Sullivan, if we do reform these processes to prevent the persecution of these students from happening again. But, as I said last night, as a result of their courageous resistance to that persecution and as a result of the courage in particular of their lawyer, my colleague and friend Mr Tony Morris QC, of the Brisbane bar, they have become heroes in the history of freedom in Australia—absolute heroes. And that is why they were made Australians of the Year in January.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Senator O'Sullivan, one of the problems you have identified—the inconsistency of interest between respondents or respondents of other people against whom complaints are made but who are not made respondents—will be able to be dealt with much more satisfactorily as a result of these amendments. As I said, there will now be an obligation imposed upon the Human Rights Commission, when it has decided to embark upon consideration of a complaint by holding an inquiry, to at once notify both the respondent and any person against whom an allegation has been made, even though they may not be the respondent. So every interested party will be gathered together at the front of the process, at the very start of the process. If there are inconsistent interests between respondents and people against whom allegations have been made, those inconsistent interests will be evident at once rather than, as happened in the QUT case, the institution—QUT—keeping the students in the dark. Not only were they not in a position to know what had been said against them, but, equally, neither they nor indeed the Human Rights Commission, in discharging its complaint resolution process, was in a position to identify and deal with potential conflicts of interest.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">It may be that in a similar case the institution may wish to concede the allegation made. That did not happen here. But let us say, for example, in an analogous case the institution decided to give an unmeritorious complainant some go away money. In doing so, depending on the terms of the settlement, it may well have conceded the allegation made, and yet, under the law as it presently stands, the actual people against whose conduct the allegation was made would not be able to be heard. So you would have this terrible situation in which an institution concedes wrongdoing on the part of other people who are not even aware the allegation has been made against them. Let me say that again: the institution could concede that people had done the wrong thing and had broken the law when these people did not even know the allegation had been made against them, they did not concede they had done the wrong thing and they had no part of the process whereby that concession was made. They would not even be consulted. That is a shocking situation. It is astonishing to me that the Labor Party are voting against an amendment that would correct that situation, but they are. Thank goodness the Greens on this occasion have been sensible enough to see the point about natural justice.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">But how can we possibly countenance a situation in which people may be accused and adjudged to be racist and they are not even been told about the allegation being made against them?</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">

I know that people are sometimes given to slightly hyperbolical language in this chamber, but I do not think it is too hyperbolical to say that this was a shocking breach of the rights of these students. Nevertheless, they became national heroes, and good luck to them.</span>

What section 46PSA would provide is that, if proceedings have been instituted under section 46PO against a respondent to a terminated complaint—these are proceedings in the court of which we speak now—and (b) the respondent has made or makes an offer to settle the matter, the subject of the complaint and the offer were rejected, the court or a judge of the court in deciding whether to award the costs in the proceedings may have regard to the offer.

So it would now read: if the applicant or the respondent has made or makes an offer to settle the subject matter of the complaint and the offer was rejected. That is really an oversight. It would have been better to deal with offers made by both applicants and respondents in relation to cost orders. </span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The Human Rights Commission is a no-costs jurisdiction, and there is a reason for that. The Human Rights Commission does not have power to award costs against a party, even a party that makes an unmeritorious complaint or a complaint that is, in effect, dismissed. The reason for that in turn is that only courts can order costs. The jurisdiction to order costs as a result of proceedings is an exercise of judicial power, and it has been long established that only courts established under chapter 3 of the Constitution can exercise judicial power. That includes making binding orders on people. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">There was a very important case about 25 years ago called Brandy and the Human Rights and Equal Opportunities Commission, which decided that the Human Rights and Equal Opportunities Commission, which is the predecessor body of the Human Rights Commission, had no power to make binding orders because to do so would vest judicial power in a body that was not a chapter 3 court. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Ever since Brandy's case, the only function of the Human Rights Commission, when it comes to dealing with parties before it, has been a complaints conciliation process. Nevertheless, there is a capacity to apply to the court for judicial review of either the dismissal of a complaint or the termination of a complaint for whatever reason. If the court deals with that matter—and that is what happened in the QUT students case because that matter was taken all the way to the Federal Circuit Court and Judge Jarrett disposed of it, as he should have done, very shortly—the court, of course, itself has the power to order costs.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">What section 46PSA would do is to ensure that, when the court considers what cost order it should make in relation to proceedings before it, it may have regard to what occurred during the conciliation process and, in particular, whether an offer to settle the matter was made and on what terms. For example, if a person received a very reasonable offer to settle the complaint at the conciliation process but they rejected that offer and prosecuted the matter all the way to the court and their proceedings were dismissed in court, then in deciding what cost orders to make the court could consider whether they had unreasonably rejected an earlier offer to settle the complaint at an earlier stage. This is alike to what lawyers call a 'Calderbank offer', which you may or may not be familiar with, Senator O'Sullivan. So that is what this is about, and the government amendment merely makes it clear that that jurisdiction should apply not merely to respondents who make offers but applicants or respondents who make offers.</span>

                    </a>  I will not detain the chamber by going through it all again, but there were, as I explained in Senate estimates last Friday week, quite long discussions with the Human Rights Commission and with Professor Triggs and her CEO, Padma Raman, about these amendments. There was quite a long meeting in Sydney on 3 March about which of the recommendations of the Parliamentary Joint Committee on Human Rights report should be adopted. I took counsel from Professor Triggs and her staff about that, and then she was provided with a copy of the bill, as I say, as soon as it was available. I had another long discussion with her last Wednesday morning as we went through the bill, and of course my staff have been in extensive discussion with officers of the Human Rights Commission. Particularly Mr Brennan and Padma Raman have been engaged very frequently with one another in relation to this matter. But, more broadly, some of these amendments deal with matters that were first raised with me by formal letter by the Human Rights Commission in April 2015. I have had many conversations with Professor Triggs about reform of the Human Rights Commission. Ever since I came into the portfolio in September 2013, at our first meeting, which would have been in either September or October 2013, I remember Professor Triggs raised the matter with me of procedural reforms to the commission. So I would, at a guess, say that I have spent over the years many more hours discussing these matters in numerous separate conversations, not to mention in estimates, with Professor Triggs than this debate has taken, but as to what the actual number of hours is, Senator Dastyari, I am not in a position to tell you.</span>

Indeed, I am instructed—it is only a rumour—that there is the fact that you reflected last night that we should not have been debating these serious and complex matters late at night.

I would like to ask you two questions. One is: is there reflection on the economic impact of that costs order limited just back to when the order was made or can they reflect on a costs order that would take matters all the way back to the beginning? Additionally, going back to my question about a vicarious issue, where a court might make an order that has an economic impact on somebody who might be representing other people, do they have any opportunity to have input—for example, a foundation that is representing in a court process a number of people? Do those people, even though they are not respondents to the original claim, have a voice within the court with the judicial process where an order may impact on them?</span>

The answer to the first question is: in relation to what a court can have regard to making a costs order, it remains the case that the Human Rights Commission is a no-cost jurisdiction. Let us say that a complaint is made, it is accepted, an inquiry is conducted and a conciliation proceeding takes place. It is terminated or comes to an end on terms that one of the parties finds unacceptable. That party goes to court, relitigates the matter in the court, that party's case fails in court and a costs order is sought, because, as you know, ordinarily, costs follow the event or the outcome of the case.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">It remains the case under these amendments that, in making a costs order, all the court can do is order the costs of the court proceedings. In other words, it is not the effect. I think this may have been misunderstood by the Labor Party. It is not the case that the effect of these amendments is to give the court a power to award costs, including the costs of the conciliation proceeding before the commission; it cannot. There is no respect in which the costs incurred by a person participating in the conciliation proceedings can be awarded against them should the matter subsequently go to court and they fail in court. All that can be awarded against them is the court costs. That having been said, of course the purpose of section 46PSA is to enable the court to acquaint itself with the fact that a reasonable offer to settle the proceedings at an earlier stage was in fact made and rejected, and the court may take that into account in deciding what order in relation to the costs of the court proceedings is just. That is a very, very familiar exercise of the costs jurisdiction by courts. That is the answer, I hope, to your first question. Now, what was the second question again? I should have taken a note. You asked me about institutions, didn't you? </span>

                    </a>  Of course. That was my intention. I was waiting for some clear air to do that, Mr Chairman. Attorney, my question talks about where an institution may make a decision, for example, where they are the respondent, and it has an impact on a collection of other individuals. Are they able to express their interest in the decision of the institutional respondent? So it might be where socialised funds are used to settle a matter. </span>

                    </a>  I am sorry, Senator. It slipped my mind what you asked. When the matter goes to court the only parties before the court are the applicant and any respondent. Let us say that there is only an outstanding issue between the applicant and one of the respondents. It is only the relevant respondent who may pursue the matter in the Federal Court who would be before the court. So, people against whom allegations are made but are not respondents would not be parties on the record in the court. But that in a sense does not matter, because, under these amendments—for which, once again, I thank the Greens for their support—those parties would have had natural justice and had the opportunity to be heard at the conciliation stage. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Of course, the orders of which we speak are only made, if made at all, by a court after there has been a failed conciliation before the commission. In the case of an institution—I am sorry, Senator O'Sullivan; I answered that question earlier—it would be very unusual, hard to think of another case, where an institution would be a complainant. But where there is an institutional respondent then the natural persons who make the decision that the institution will respond in a particular way would not be parties before the court if the complaint is made against the institution itself. </span>

                      <span class="HPS-MemberContinuation">Senator McKIM:</span>
                    </a>  I am happy to take the interjection and acknowledge what the Attorney said, but it does not derail in any way the fundamental point that I am making here, which is that the commission has raised concerns, and I have no doubt it has raised these concerns directly with the Attorney, because he has been very clear that there have been a number of engagements between himself and Professor Triggs over the journey on this and other matters.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The issue here is that the commission is all about attempting to conciliate matters, so we ought not legislate to reduce the likelihood of a successful conciliation in the Human Rights Commission. We believe that is what you are doing here, Attorney, and this amendment—and I am talking about it in the context of items 49 and 57 of the Human Rights Legislation Amendment Bill 2017—taken as a whole, we think, will provide a disincentive for people to enter into good faith conciliation through the processes of the Human Rights Commission. That is our concern here. We believe that, taken as a whole, these amendments will make it less likely that matters will be settled through the Human Rights Commission process and will therefore actually increase the likelihood that matters will end up in the court system, which is exactly what the Human Rights Commission was created to try to avoid. It was created, in part, to try to set up a conciliation process whereby parties could come together in a less formal way than a judicial process in the hope that matters could be kept out of the court system, dealt with in a less formal way and settled in a less formal way.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We believe that people may choose to enter into conciliation, including making offers of settlement, precisely because they know their communications and their offers are protected. We have concerns that if a party knows that their discussions and their offers are not protected and may be taken into account by the courts in later proceedings they may be discouraged from entering into those good faith negotiations and making those good faith offers. We also have concerns that there is potential for parties here to engage in fishing expeditions for information that can be used in subsequent litigation rather than maintaining a genuine good faith attempt to conciliate.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Even though we acknowledge that the specific amendment that we are dealing with here does, to a very small degree, improve the relevant sections of the Human Rights Legislation Amendment Bill, which are items 49 and 57, we do not think it is our job in this place to help you make a very poor piece of legislation marginally better, particularly when we are not going to support the substantive provisions of the Human Rights Legislation Amendment Bill to which this legislation pertains. On that basis, we will not be supporting the government's amendment.</span>

                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Queensland</span>—<span class="HPS-MinisterialTitles">Attorney-General, Vice-President of the Executive Council and Leader of the Government in the Senate</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">11:27</span>):  Senator McKim, I agree with the first of the propositions you have put in that contribution, and I disagree with the second, for the reasons I will explain. But may I make the perhaps gratuitous observation of how much better it would have been if we had had contributions of this quality throughout the morning and actually debated the bill rather than having all the gratuitous political flim-flam. Nevertheless, this is a good question.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Senator McKim, your question was as wise and intelligent as anything that has fallen from Senator O'Sullivan or Senator Paterson. The first observation you make in your contribution is that we want to encourage the conciliation process and we do not want, by putting any provisions into the act, to inhibit the capacity of the conciliation process to do its work and to resolve matters at that stage. I agree with that entirely, and that is what the government is seeking to do. But you then say, and this is where we part company, that by including this costs jurisdiction—section 46PSA—into the act that will, in fact, encourage people to take their matters further and into court and, therefore, it will defeat the objective of trying to make the conciliation process the whole focus of the dispute resolution between complainants and respondents and encourage more matters to proceed to court.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I completely disagree that that will be the effect of it, and I do so for several reasons. First of all, the effect of section 46PSA, were it to be enacted, would plainly act as a disincentive against applications—certainly unmeritorious applications—to the court because a person who applies to the court would have a greater risk if they knew that they had previously rejected a settlement offer at the conciliation level. They would expose themselves to a greater risk or hazard of having an adverse cost order made against them in the court, so that is plainly a disincentive to take proceedings to the court.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Secondly, in other amendments that the Senate is considering, we have, subject to some exceptions, made it the general rule that there is no longer a right of appeal, as it were, to the court from a failed conciliation, that applications to the court can only be by leave. So under the new provisions it will be very unusual for any of these complaints to end up in court in any event. But, in the event that the court were to grant leave, the fact that there is this explicit cost jurisdiction that enables the court to have regard to what for these purposes would be the equivalent of what lawyers know as a Calderbank offer is plainly a disincentive to doing so, because it is very obvious that you expose yourself to a hazard that does not exist at the moment. Although I agree with your first observation, the conclusion you draw from that observation is, with all due respect, wrong.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">While I am on my feet, might I make this other observation about section 46PSA—that is, the power to award costs. I know that the Greens dissented, in the report of the Parliamentary Joint Committee on Human Rights, from this recommendation. But I should point out to the chamber that this proposed measure—the new section 46PSA, as amended by government amendment (11)—gives effect to a bipartisan recommendation of the Labor and coalition members of the committee. It was recommendation 19. Let me read it to you:</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">The committee recommends that the Australian Human Rights Commission Act 1986 be amended to make explicit that, subject to the court's discretion—</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">and the court always has a discretion about cost orders—</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">an applicant pay a respondent's costs of future proceedings if they are unsuccessful or if the respondent has, at any earlier point, offered a remedy which is at least equivalent to the remedy which is ultimately ordered.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">And that, of course, can only be offered by way of a settlement offer. So I think the Labor Party has fallen into deep confusion here, because they are voting against the amendment which they themselves joined with government members and senators in recommending at recommendation 19 of the Parliamentary Joint Committee on Human Rights report.</span>

                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Victoria</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">11:32</span>):  I had at the outset of these amendments, many hours ago, indicated Labor's position in relation to all of the amendments. But for clarity's sake I repeat very briefly that we are opposed to both this amendment and amendment (12). It might have assisted the process had the government moved them together. The Greens position is similar on the second one. But here we are, with this long, drawn-out process. Let me respond briefly to the comment of Senator Brandis alleging deep confusion from the Labor Party. Seriously, Attorney! The deep confusion is that which is with the government. I highlighted in my earlier remarks that the government does not even understand recommendation 3. You accurately represented it, but the government members of the committee completely mischaracterised it in the report. In relation to this matter, the biggest problem the government has is that, rather than us spending an enormous amount of time here in the chamber, the discussions and the detailed consultation in relation to the amendments has not occurred. That is what is not occurred. Senator Brandis says that is not the truth. It is clearly, clearly the truth.</span>

                    </a>  The effect of amendment (12), which is the last of the government amendments, is to ensure that these reforms, for which I thank the Senate, will begin to operate at once. The commission receives complaints on a regular and frequent basis. The parliament has resolved that complaints before the commission should be subject to obligations to deal with them subject to the rules of natural justice; that the commission should be obliged to deal with them in a timely fashion; that it should be obliged to deal with them in a way that protects the interests of non-respondents, who are the subjects of adverse allegations, and in a manner that enables the earlier identification of unmeritorious or vexatious complaints. With all of those policy choices having now been made by the Senate, there is absolutely no reason why the provisions of the act should not begin to operate at once or upon proclamation. Therefore government amendment (12) makes it perfectly clear that, upon the amendment to the act being proclaimed, the reforms that the Senate has been wise enough to make will operate at once upon existing complaints as well as upon future complaints.</span>

I believe they belong to the class of amendments which are designed to nobble how the Human Rights Commission works, and that was the context in which I said they sat in that same class. If the Attorney had wanted to proceed swiftly through those amendments—although I apologise, Senator McKim; I was not aware that you had questions in relation to this particular amendment—he could easily have moved a number of them together, but we all know what is occurring here.</span>

Senator McKim, in response to your question, I am not in a position to tell you how many complaints the commission has before it at the moment, but I can tell you that the volume of complaints to the Human Rights Commission has increased steadily in the recent past. One might wonder why that is, because I do not think there has been an increase in racism, sexism, age discrimination or discrimination against disabled people in Australia in the recent past. One wonders what role complaint solicitors like those who engage in the soliciting of complaints, like Dr Soutphommasane, may have had in that.</span>

That is such a silly thing to say, with respect. This merely says that the rules that the Senate has adopted in relation to complaints should apply to all complaints, including complaints that are currently before the commission. It is as simple as that. If the Senate has seen fit to conclude, as it has done, that in future all complaints made to the commission should be subject to these new procedures, there is absolutely no logical reason for saying that current complaints should not be subject to the same rules as future complaints. Amendment (12) is as simple as that.</span>

                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Tasmania</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">11:49</span>):  Firstly, the Human Rights Commission is opposed to this amendment, and there is a very good reason why they are opposed to it. This goes to the Attorney's last point where he says there is no logic to anyone opposing this. There is an absolute logic to opposition to this clause, and I will now spell it out for the Attorney. The logic of opposing this is that, however many complaints are on foot currently at the commission, the Attorney, in confessing that he does not know—which I find astounding, to be honest—is actually confessing that he has no idea of the extent of the significant administrative burden that this legislation will place on the commission. I find that an extraordinary confession for the Attorney-General to make. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">In any event, I am sure we can agree there are a significant number of complaints afoot in the Human Rights Commission, as we stand here today. What this amendment will do is require the Human Rights Commission to review every single complaint that is currently afoot and then take the necessary action to comply with the burden that this amendment will place on the commission. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I accept that there is an insertion here that requires that the president be satisfied that it is practicable to do so. I accept that, but that still places a decision point on the president with regard to every single complaint that is currently afoot, because the president will have to look at every single complaint—I would not be surprised by the way, if there are thousands of complaints across the full range of matters that the Human Rights Commission has responsibility for. What you are requiring here, Attorney, through the chair, is that the president will need to review and make a decision—at least one decision—which is whether or not it is practicable to take the action that you are proposing the commission take with regard to every single complaint that is currently afoot with regard to the individual circumstances of every single complaint that is afoot. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">It is very hard to escape the conclusion here that the Attorney is deliberately trying to gum up the wheels of the Human Rights Commission and that, in doing so, he is acting extremely counterintuitively because the continued complaint from those who have wanted reform to 18C and reform to the processes of the Human Rights Commission has been that cases are taking too long to settle. This will place a significant administrative burden on the commission and it will, at best, significantly delay every single case that is currently afoot. </span>

It is, by its own admission, not based on any principle whatsoever. The Senate has decided that there is a more appropriate, just and efficient way of dealing with complaints to the Human Rights Commission. That is what we have decided, assuming the bill gets a third reading. Having made that decision, there is absolutely no reason why complaints currently before the commission should be treated any differently. If we, the Senate, decide that the rules governing the conciliation of complaints are wrong and should be changed, and have made that decision, then of course the new rules, the reformed rules, that the Senate in its wisdom has decided ought to be given effect to should apply to current complaints as well. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">So you do not make a principle objection at all, Senator, but you say, 'Well, this might impose an administrative burden on the Human Rights Commission.' I am bound to say, for a body that, to the best of my recollection, receives about $26 million a year in taxpayer funding, I do not think that, frankly, to expect the commission to do an audit of its current complaints for compliance with the new rules is unreasonable at all or that it imposes an unendurable administrative burden. We have debated those sections of the bill that are in controversy. It may have escaped the attention of those following the debate, but it should not have, but many of the measures the government is proposing have been uncontroversial and therefore they have not been subject to any discussion in this debate. But the effect of most of those measures, in particular the measures proposed by Professor Triggs in her letter to me of April 2015, was to relieve the Human Rights Commission of administrative burdens, to relieve the Human Rights Commission of a huge number of unnecessary administrative burdens. So what this legislation in fact is doing is freeing up the Human Rights Commission of the administrative burdens that they themselves have pointed to and asked to be excused from, and the government has agreed. If in a transition period from the old arrangements to the new arrangements the Human Rights Commission, which is now free of all these other administrative burdens, has to conduct an audit of its current complaints to see if they are compliant with the new rules, then that is no more than any government and the public ought reasonably to expect from any public agency.</span>

                    </a>  The Attorney firstly cannot tell us how many complaints are currently afoot. I find that extraordinary. It shows how out of touch with his portfolio he actually is. But he has effectively confessed that this will place a significant burden on the commission, because he has accepted that they will need to audit the entirety of their caseload. No-one has said that this is not possible—I want to be clear about that. But what we have said, and it has not been rebutted by the Attorney—and I would like him to respond to this—is that when you have a commission that has a finite body of resources, whether they be human or financial, imposing a significant burden of reviewing every single one of what I believe are likely to be thousands of cases currently afoot at the commission will inevitably mean that the normal business of the commission, which is to progress the cases that are afoot, will be compromised by the need to conduct the audit that the Attorney has accepted that the commission will need to do if this amendment is successful. So this is retrospectivity that he is imposing on the commission. In any reasonable definition this is retrospectivity. He is asking the commission to change the way they are proceeding in relation to matters that were lodged with them before the law was changed, if in fact it does get changed as a result of this amendment. So we are strongly opposed to this. Again, it appears vindictive in the extreme that the Attorney is proposing.</span>

                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Queensland</span>—<span class="HPS-MinisterialTitles">Attorney-General, Vice-President of the Executive Council and Leader of the Government in the Senate</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">11:59</span>):  Again, that is such a foolish contribution. Senator McKim, for a start it is absurd to say that this is retrospective. Legislation is retrospective only if it alters pre-existing rights and liabilities, and nobody has suggested that this legislation does that. So your suggestion that it operates retrospectively is absurd.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Secondly, what we are talking about is a transition period between an existing set of arrangements and a new and more efficient set of arrangements, because it is not disputed by anyone that the new arrangements, which the Senate has agreed to, will make the Human Rights Commission work more efficiently and will take an administrative burden from their shoulders. So, in transitioning from an old and burdensome set of arrangements to a new and less administratively burdensome set of arrangements, the suggestion that we are somehow going to interfere with the work of the Human Rights Commission is ridiculous.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Thirdly, Senator, let me tell you what the principal compliance obligation is, because they will have to have a look at all the complaints that are before them. Let me tell you what the burden which so weighs upon your mind will be. I am advised that the principal burden that will weigh upon the commission is a requirement that they write to each respondent to a complaint that is currently on foot. That is, I am advised, the principal obligation cast upon them—that they write letters to people with whom they are in correspondence already. It is ridiculous, just ridiculous, of you to suggest that that is an unendurable burden for a public agency.</span>

                      <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Senator HANSON</span>
                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Queensland</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">12:01</span>):  I have been sitting in the chamber listening to the debate on the Human Rights Legislation Amendment Bill 2017 for the last 2½ hours, nearly three hours, since the chamber started this morning. I have found it very informative. I am not on the government's side. I am one of the crossbenchers, and I am here to listen on behalf of my constituents. I think it has been very informative, and I have learnt a lot this morning. I have listened to both sides' concerns in this chamber.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I would like to say that recommendations have come from the commission itself to the government and changes that need to be done. Through you, Chair, Senator McKim has made a comment about how many cases there are. I do not have the figures in front of me, but I am of the opinion that it is around 124 in this last year. In the previous year it was about 17. That in itself will tell the chamber the number of cases that are coming before the commission. Are they frivolous? Are they just vexatious litigation against innocent people? That is something that needs to be cleaned up, and I think that in changing this legislation with the amendments we will start to head towards that, because the onus is now going to be put on the people making those complaints. They will not be able to just go out there and say, 'I want $250,000.' It is going to be up to the courts to decide that. I think it is a very good step to alleviate the pressure on the commission from people who want to put in frivolous claims.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I will just revert back to the uni students at that time, to the complaint. If anything, it is reverse racism, because here we have some university students who were not Aboriginal who went to use a computer room and found that it was Aboriginal-only. Why shouldn't they put a complaint into the commission themselves, saying that they were wrongly treated? This is what is happening. Where are the opposition, where are the Greens, complaining about this? I do not hear them screaming from the rooftops about this. If you want it to be fair, do it right across the board. Treat everyone equally on an individual needs basis.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I do support the government in these procedural matters changes. I will put it on record. I am sorry that One Nation did not vote with the government in changing the wording regarding insult, offend and humiliate last night—only on the basis that I agree with changing it to 'harass and intimidate'. But it was only on the basis that (2)2B(a) meant that 'harass' was on only one occasion. 'Harass' to me means multiple occasions. That is why I did not support that. I do support that it should have been changed to the two words, as I said.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I wish the opposition and also the Greens would look at this debate in a logical sense and look at what is fair and just. That is all the people ask of us: to look at any legislation in this place and make it fair and just. That is what the people expect of us. The changes in this—I have heard the Greens are going to oppose this. I cannot see any reasonable grounds as to why they are opposing this. It is what the commission has asked for. It is what is fair and just for everyone. It will help us process this whole debate.</span>

                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Victoria</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">12:15</span>):  I am happy with the approach proposed by Senator McKim. I can indicate, though, that Labor is supporting all of the Greens amendments. I suppose we will wait to hear from the government whether it has any alternative approach that will facilitate that. Let me indicate that Labor is supporting all of these amendments which make appropriate changes to the complaints handling process of the Human Rights Commission. These changes have been made in consultation with the commission in the light of the recommendations of the Parliamentary Joint Committee on Human Rights. Labor opposes the introduction of a mandatory 'accept-reject' stage into the commission's complaints process. This will add additional delay and added costs for parties, as the Tasmanian Anti-Discrimination Commissioner has said. This phase would encourage parties to litigate decisions made during the conciliation process of complaints handling. </span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The commission submitted to the inquiry that proposed section 46PF(9)(a) of the bill should be removed. The obligation to notify a person who is not a respondent but who is the subject of an adverse allegation is likely to be onerous and in many cases unnecessary. It is not needed to address the concerns that have been raised about the commission's handling of the QUT complaint. Those concerns are addressed by Labor's proposed amendments to proposed sections 46PF(7) and 46PF(8) of the bill to implement recommendation 5 of the PJCHR's report.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Labor believes that matters discussed during the conciliation should remain confidential. Proposed sections 46PKA(2) and 46PSA are inconsistent with this, and we will not support them. Privacy and confidentiality are fundamental requirements of the successful operation of the commission's conciliation function and encourage voluntary participation in the process.</span>

The effect of the amendments would be to unwind the main reforms that the Senate has now agreed to. Let us be perfectly clear about that. There are two categories of amendments that have been moved by leave together. The first would be to unwind the decision that the Senate has made to require there to be a mandatory assessment, before an inquiry is commenced, as to whether or not a complaint has substance. That is, in my view, the most important reform we have agreed upon. The effect of Senator McKim's amendments (1), (2) and (3) would be to negative it. For that reason, those amendments should certainly be opposed. Equally, amendments (7), (8) and (9) deal with the costs jurisdiction that we have just discussed and just voted on. Once again, the effect of Senator McKim's amendments would be effectively to negative the decision that the Senate has just made. So all of those senators and particularly crossbench senators who were good enough to support the government's reforms should certainly oppose Senator McKim's amendments because these are a rearguard action to overturn what the Senate has already decided.</span>

                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Tasmania</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">12:17</span>):  I do not intend to respond at great length to what the Attorney has said, but I do want to place a couple of matters on the record, particularly in relation to—as the Attorney has categorised it—the accept-reject phase for dealing with complaints. I want to just draw the Senate's attention here to the evidence given to the Parliamentary Joint Committee on Human Rights by the former Tasmanian Anti-Discrimination Commissioner, Robin Banks—and an excellent Anti-Discrimination Commissioner she was too, I might add. I will just read into the <span style="font-style:italic;">Hansard</span> record what Ms Banks said about a very similar provision in the Tasmanian Anti-Discrimination Act. She said this:</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Small">Litigation in a situation where it is often, but not always, the case where the respondent has more financial and other power—and therefore can use the legal process to create delay and to put the complainant to cost and expense, that this process is designed not to have involved, for either party.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The issue here is that the creation of a mandatory accept-reject phase provides an opportunity for a person to take the matter out of the hands of the commission and into the judicial system.

The risk here is that someone who has enough money to hire themselves a silk or even to hire themselves a lawyer to advise them will now, should our amendments not be accepted by the Senate, have the opportunity, by the Senate's insertion of a legally challengeable decision point into the Human Rights Commission process, to take matters out of the hands of the commission and into the hands of the courts, with significant extra expense and delay a possibility.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I will speak very briefly to amendments (5) and (6). They go to the issue of confidentiality. Under the current legislation, any report provided by the president to a court on a terminated complaint must not set out or describe anything said or done during conciliation. This is important, in the view of the Greens, because the willingness of parties to voluntarily settle differences through conciliation depends in large part on the confidentiality of the process. Our concern is that, if parties fear that their disclosures during a conciliation may be used against them or published outside the process, it is likely that the process will be weakened. I draw the attention of the Senate to the submission by the Human Rights Commission to the Parliamentary Joint Committee on Human Rights, which said:</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">In relation to confidentiality, Senator McKim, I largely agree with you, but that is provided for by section 46PKA(1), which provides—this is in the government's bill, okay?—that evidence of anything said or done by a person in the course of the conciliation of a complaint in accordance with section 46PF is not admissible in any proceedings relating to the alleged acts, omissions or practices. So that is the rule. The rule that you say ought to be the case is the case.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The effect of your amendment, though, Senator McKim, would be to remove an exception to that rule in relation to offers to settle the proceedings, which is the very issue that we debated about 40 minutes ago so as to make section 46PSA operable. If Senator McKim's amendment were to be passed, then it would not be possible for the courts to deal with the costs jurisdiction that this chamber has just agreed to, so this is another attempt at a rearguard action to effectively reverse a decision the Senate has just made.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">These amendments clarify the role of the president in the complaints process. There are some situations where a complainant decides not to proceed with a complaint after receiving initial feedback from the commission and asks that their complaint be withdrawn. In those cases a requirement for notification of respondents would be an additional unnecessary step. These amendments implement recommendation (5) of the Parliamentary Joint Committee on Human Rights report and reflect a recommendation of the commission.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">These amendments also remove sections 46PH(1B) to 46PH(1D). The commission submitted to the committee that mandatory termination provisions are not appropriate. Mandatory termination provisions would encourage parties to a complaint to engage in a judicial review of a decision to terminate or not terminate on this ground during the complaint-handling process. As has been the case in Tasmania, this would lead to additional delay and added costs for parties to complaints. This amendment ensures that the president can still terminate a complaint on the grounds that he or she is satisfied that the complaint was trivial, vexatious, misconceived or lacking in substance.</span>

We have already had this discussion, and I will not detain the Senate for any length at all. This is, effectively, the same amendment as the Greens' amendment which was just defeated. It is an attempt to unwind the decision that the Senate has just made to deal with complaints handling processes, so as to have a preliminary determination by the President as to whether or not the complaint has substance, and to make that step mandatory, before embarking on a full inquiry. This is, as I say, merely a rearguard action to reverse the decisions that the Senate has already made, and, for that reason, obviously, the government will be opposing the amendments, and those of the crossbench who supported the government's position in the previous debate should, with respect, take the same view.</span>

These are significant and material changes that will improve the operation of Australia's Human Rights Commission, to avoid the abuses and the misuse of the commission that we have seen in the recent past. Might I finally, in closing the debate, say that we, in the government, have all been inspired in this debate by those who have been persecuted through its processes and we are inspired today by the memory of the late Bill Leak.</span>

                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Tasmania</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">12:43</span>):  I want to speak briefly on the third reading. This bill amends a number of matters associated with how the Human Rights Commission operates. Some, as we have consistently said, we believe are improvements and will result in improved processes in the Human Rights Commission. Some, as we have also said, we think are retrograde and will actually reduce the capacity of the commission to do its job. But we are now required to take the bill, as amended, as a whole, and make a judgement on whether or not we should support it on the third reading. We believe, after careful examination of all of the relevant amendments that, on balance, they do constitute a slight improvement for the Human Rights Commission in the way that it operates and, on that basis, we will not be opposing this bill on the third reading.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">But I do want to remind the Senate, and remind anyone watching or listening, that—despite the fact that today's debate has been focused exclusively on machinery provisions that relate to the operations of the Human Rights Commission—the landmark decision that this parliament has made when considering this legislation is actually the decision to retain section 18C of the Racial Discrimination Act in its current form. That is a great victory for multicultural Australia; it is a massive defeat for those who sought to make it easier to be racist in our country. Today the Australian Greens are celebrating with multicultural Australia and those who have stood up for that rich fabric that underpins so much of our everyday life and the lucky life that we lead in this country. We celebrate with them in the knowledge that, for now, section 18C of the Racial Discrimination Act remains unchanged and we rededicate ourselves to make sure that it remains unchanged into the future.</span>

I will observe that it is a speaking list, with one exception—that being myself—comprised of government members and, I think, one member of One Nation. There are 17 people on this list. What it suggests to me is that, after this chamber has been sitting for almost a year since an election was held, the government—which went to that election with a great big tax cut for corporations as the centrepiece of their economic management strategy—have made absolutely no progress in any way in establishing a deal to get support for their proposition. How ridiculous. Having spent days debating the failed human rights changes in this chamber, we are now going to be presented with 17 speakers to filibuster on the centrepiece of the government's budget commitments. How ridiculous.</span>

                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Western Australia</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">12:47</span>):  What is it that people do not get? What is it about people who have never been in or run or paid up for the management and the establishment and the conduct of a business? What is it they do not get? Investment equals jobs. Investment equals productivity. Investment equals production. It equals improved jobs. It equals higher skilled jobs. For a country that relies so heavily on export, investment encourages export. We are a country of 24 million people—an area that has the population of Greater New York—and yet we live in a country the size of continental America, with the exception of Alaska. Does anybody ever ask themselves: how is it that, per capita, Australia and Australians are so wealthy when you have the population of New York in the land mass of America? It is because of investment. Not one of us would be in this place if it had not been for the forethought and the risk-taking and the investment by people before us. In my own case, I can speak of over 40 years of taking risk, mortgaging a home, shifting states and investing. Why? Because I was encouraged by the climate in this country to invest and in so doing expanded my business activities, and in so doing employed more people, improved profitability, improved export opportunities, enhanced Australia's reputation internationally and, indeed, increased the skill level of people who have worked for me. What is it that we do not get about investment? You hear people talking about overseas investment, about multinational investment. If there had not been overseas investment in 1788 there would be no European settlement in this country. It is absolutely beyond me why people do not understand the value and the benefit of investment.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Why do people invest? One, because they see an opportunity. Two, they measure up the risk to decide whether or not the opportunity is worth exploring. Three, they either have, or can, put a case to a bank and they seek investment to be able to establish that business, to employ people, to expand, to develop the skill sets of those people, and to invest in technology or machinery or whatever the nature of the business is. But one of the biggest issues is the taxation regime attendant upon that company.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">In my contribution to the debate on the Treasury Laws Amendment (Enterprise Tax Plan) Bill 2016 I will address the ease and speed with which capital can move around the world, and Senator Whish-Wilson of all people knows the ease and speed with which capital can move around the world. Let me give you the best and most current example I can. When the mining tax was introduced by the Labor Party, prior to its introduction 65 per cent of mining exploration investment by ASX registered companies in Australia was in Australia and 35 per cent was overseas. Within one year—not 10, not 15, not long term—when the risk of a mining tax was attendant upon them, do you know how that changed? It changed from 65 per cent exploration in Australia to 35 per cent—it reversed. In the first year alone, investment by ASX registered companies changed from 65 per cent to 35 per cent.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">You ask why Australia cannot retain the high tax level it has? You only have to look at that where else it is possible for Australian companies, let alone multinational companies, to invest their funds. In Singapore, what is the corporate tax rate? It is 17 per cent, and the flying time from my home city of Perth to Singapore is the same as the flying time from Perth across to here—and Senator Smith and I desperately hope it won't be long before we get on such a plane to go home! Five hours!</span>

I will treat these interjections with the disdain they deserve and I will go on to explain to you the level of taxation now in the United Kingdom, a country that is about to leave the EU and a country with which we could well be, once again, increasing our levels of trade back to those prior to the British joining the EU. How would those from Tasmania not remember how that tremendous trade in fruit, particularly including apples, collapsed when the British joined the EU. What is their level of taxation? Twenty-four per cent. We know, for example, that should this Trump administration be successful they will reduce their levels of corporate tax to 20 per cent.</span>

                    </a>  I find it incredible. A man who himself was so tied up in the world of international finance, who knows very, very well that what companies do when they make money beyond paying tax is reinvest that money into their business, in business opportunities and expansion. Senator Whish-Wilson himself has done that; he is an example of that business success. I am at a loss to understand why his principles have changed the way they have. I am sure the day will come when I am given the opportunity to sample some of the product from his enterprise.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">But let me concentrate for a moment on small business in this country—the engine room, as we all know. Over three million workers are employed in small business in Australia, and small business contributes $340 billion to our economy. Why do I want to contrast small business with that of large business? Simply because when you look at stability of employment you need look no further than the global financial crisis. What happened with big business at and following the GFC? They reduced staff numbers considerably—yet small business in this country retained and maintained their level of workforce. As we came out of the global financial crisis, we knew what was going on: as always, the entrepreneurial small business person in a region, in a town, in the city or wherever wanted to invest in increasing that business activity. It is in the DNA of people in business to want to expand that business activity. We know that you need that level of stability in an economy, but you also need a competitive tax rate. Why would you do business in Australia if you could do an equivalent rate of business in Singapore, where you are paying 17 per cent in contrast to paying 30 per cent? It is absolutely important that we create a more level playing field.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I will respond to a comment that Senator Whish-Wilson made, because he and I both know something of the economies of the United States of America. We both know in that jurisdiction there is a federal tax and there is a state tax. In the case of California, where I resided and worked, the rate of state tax was about the same as federal tax.

                    </a>  Five taxes. In the state of Texas, there is no state tax. Yes, they earn their revenue charging higher rates on residential and investment land, but there is no state tax. Have a look at the economy of Texas at the moment in contrast to that of California, where many of the cities and the counties of California are actually either bankrupt or near it. In comparison to the United States, I have mentioned United Kingdom, whose corporate tax rates have gone down from 30 per cent in 2008 to 20 per cent in 2015. Over the period 2008 to 2014, Canada reduced its main corporate rate from an average of 36 to 26 per cent and Singapore, as I have mentioned, have reduced theirs to 17 per cent from 20 per cent.</span>

                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I want to make some comments about the security of activity and what the multinationals and others—the big end of town—are saying. It was only on Tuesday night of this week that Professor Ian Harper from Deloitte Access Economics at the 50th anniversary of the Minerals Council launched the executive summary of mining and mining equipment and technology services in Australia. I want to put on the record the scale of mining and mining technology in this country because they are new figures which Deloitte Access Economics, using figures from the tax office, the Reserve Bank and others, have calculated. I quote from that report. The total economic contribution of Australia's mining and mining equipment and technology sector in 2015-16 was just under $240 billion, representing 15 per cent of the Australian economy, and it supported a total of 1.139 million FTE jobs, or somewhere around 10 per cent of the Australian workforce.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">But let me tell you what Professor Harper and his team have recognised might limit or reduce mining activity in this country. Of course, one of those things which is particularly important is a competitive and fair taxation system. As Professor Harper says in his report, it is important to ensure that Australia's corporate taxation rate and other mining related taxes are stable and competitive relative to other economies and to uphold good economic principles in setting taxation policy, especially in respect of taxing business inputs. He speaks of openness to foreign investment and efficient approaches to regulation. I mention again that there are 1.14 million jobs supported by the mining sector in this country. Do we really want to see that level of investment reduced? Do we really want to see that being exported offshore? As Senator Smith knows only too well, that the entire mining activity of Africa is principally serviced and managed out of Western Australian hard rock mining companies. African leaders who came to CHOGM in 2013 realised in speaking to the then Premier of Western Australia that the entire mining industry in their countries was managed within one kilometre of his office in West Perth. So do not think for one minute that there is not the capacity to move that level of investment elsewhere.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I come secondly to another project related to investment and the importance of taxation, and that is the US$100 billion projects by Chevron—Gorgon, on Barrow Island, offshore of Western Australia, and the Wheatstone Project at Onslow. Let me tell you again that two or three of the Gorgon trains, that being LNG, are already producing and already earning massive amounts of export wealth for this country. And by the end of next year all five trains—three at Gorgon and two at Wheatstone—will be producing. From that project, there will be a ship leaving Western Australia every 40 hours for the next 30 years—subject to us being able to ensure a safe and profitable investment climate.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I will share with the chamber some figures from ACIL Allen Consulting. The prediction is that just those two projects will contribute more than $1 trillion to Australia's GDP, 150,000 FTE jobs and $340 billion to the federal revenue of Australia over at that time—besides the incredible upskilling, besides the exporting also of highly skilled Australian workers who have developed technologies that are so valuable. Once again, I go to the conclusions of the managing director of Chevron Australia, Mr Nigel Hearne. In a speech just last week he said Australia can be the world's best producer and supplier of natural gas and we can lead the world in responsible development, in the provision of reliable and affordable energy, facilitating internationally competitive policy settings.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">He also goes on to say that we must have a competitive taxation regime so that there will be continued inflow of capital to this country. We have already seen a decision by BP, a company that has been investing heavily in Australia for close to 100 years—the big BP refinery in Western Australia, as Senator Smith and I well know, provides all of the refined product in the west side of the country—has already made a decision that it is not going to proceed with exploration in the Great Australian Bight. Fortunately, Chevron are so minded, as a result of $100 billion of investment to date, that they are going to proceed with exploration in the bight, which they say could well be a very prospective operation indeed.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I come back to the point I made at the beginning of this contribution: what is it that people do not get about the need to have attractive investment incentives? We want jobs; we want people to invest in jobs; we want people to invest in the skilling of those. You know as well as I do, Madam Deputy President, we have the new exciting Shell Prelude, the largest vessel ever built, completing its construction in Korea and to be placed, I believe, on the Jansz field, offshore from Western Australia. The floating LNG.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We have to continue to encourage investment, but we will not encourage investment if we have a tax rate of 30 per cent when those with whom we compete are already down at 24 per cent or 22 per cent and heading to 20 per cent or, in the case of Singapore, 17 per cent. Why would a company do all of its expansion and all of its development and all of its marketing out of Australia if our tax rates at the corporate level are 30 per cent, when one of the largest fuel industry logistics hubs in the world, in Singapore, charges 17 per cent? I ask people who are opposed to this legislation to think very carefully, because you are limiting the future of jobs for yourselves, for your children, for your grandchildren and for the wellbeing of this country.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">What does Labor have to hide? I will give you a tip: you can quickly rush out to the lobby, find a <span style="font-style:italic;">Daily Telegraph</span> of 28 March—just this week—and you will see what Labor is trying to hide. The absence of Labor speakers on the speaking list says one thing: Labor is trying to hide. What could it be that the Labor Party is trying to hide from senators this afternoon, from those people listening to the broadcast and, indeed, from those people in the gallery? What could it possibly be, Senator Gallagher, Senator Urquhart, that you are trying to hide? They are trying to hide the fact that in the past Labor has not just supported corporate tax reform, but gone on the record and defended it vigorously. And I do not mean the Labor Party of the 1980s, even though they had a better economic record than you were able to manage. I am happy to admit it. I have admitted in other places—indeed, in this Senate chamber—that the Labor Party of the 1980s in the way that it tackled economic reform is a model. It is certainly a model for this Labor Party in 2017.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">So what is it that Labor is trying to hide by not having any of its speakers on the speakers list? What is it trying to hide? Is it trying to hide Bill Shorten's comments about the importance of corporate tax reform? Is it trying to hide Chris Bowen's comments about corporate tax reform? Is it trying to hide Anthony Albanese's comments about corporate tax reform? Is it trying to hide, indeed, its own Senate leader's comments about the importance of corporate tax reform?</span>

No-one in Labor has the courage to come into this Senate chamber and talk about what they have said previously about corporate tax reform. So let me share with the Australian Senate what the current Leader of the Opposition said in March 2011 about the importance of corporate tax reform, the importance of tax cuts for businesses. He said:</span>

                    </a>  It was a long night, and I do feel like I am on a bit of a roll, Deputy President. Let me share with the Australian Senate this afternoon why I think that the Labor shadow Treasury spokesman, Chris Bowen, is also correct. Labor's shadow Treasury spokesman, Mr Bowen, said in July 2013:</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">… our ambition would be lower company tax rates over time because it does improve our international competitiveness.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">So said Labor's current shadow Treasurer, Mr Bowen. And on this issue, today in the Senate, I have to say that I agree with the Labor shadow Treasurer, and he should have the courage to agree with Malcolm Turnbull. Indeed, Labor senators should have the courage to come into the Senate this afternoon and support the government's tax cuts. Do you know why? Because they did previously.</span>

                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Let me share with you that the Labor shadow spokesman on regional development and transport—I am happy to stand corrected—Mr Anthony Albanese, in June 2010, said:</span>
                </p>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">He said:</span>

                    </a>  You are probably thinking to yourself, Senator O'Sullivan: 'How can Senator Smith top that? How can Senator Smith top those four quotes?' This will be the last quote to demonstrate what I think is a very, very important point, and I will come to that in a second. Whatever differences I might have with the Australian Labor Party, there can be no disputing that under the stewardship first of former Prime Minister Bob Hawke and later of Paul Keating, on the issue of economic reform, supported by a coalition in opposition who saw the merits of bipartisanship on many of these issues, Mr Keating, the former Prime Minister, said, in February 1993:</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">We lowered the company tax rate from 39 per cent to 33, providing Australian industry with a business tax system competitive with any in the world.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">So, I start my contribution this afternoon by highlighting what I think is a very, very important point. We have a Labor opposition in the Senate that is trying to suggest that somehow the speakers list, full of government senators, is a grand conspiracy. Rather, it is because the Labor Party cannot own up to its current position, which is to oppose company tax cuts, because it highlights, in stark contrast, its earlier position, which was to support company tax cuts, because they know it is in the national interest. They know it is in the economy's interests. They know it is in the interests of small business as well as medium to larger-size businesses in our country.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We often hear that politicians cannot think long term. Nowhere is that truer than with the Labor Party's opposition to the Turnbull government's Enterprise Tax Plan. The difference between this government and the Labor Party is that we are not short-sighted when it comes to making the tough decisions that will support the long-term interests of Australia. Unlike the Labor Party, we are not scared to support business, especially family-run small businesses. Unlike the Labor Party, we believe that creating a fairer tax system and reducing the tax burden on small and medium businesses increases productivity, creates jobs and strengthens our economy.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This bill represents the most significant reform to Australia's business taxation framework since the introduction of the goods and services tax. It will immediately reduce the company tax rate for over 87,000 Australian businesses with a turnover of up to $10 million, taking that tax rate to 27.5 per cent. It will reduce the company tax rate for all Australian businesses to 25 per cent by 2026-27 and increase the unincorporated tax discount for small businesses from five per cent to 16 per cent by 2026-27. These reforms will assist hardworking Australian small businesses, unlock business investment, drive economic activity and create jobs in our local communities. They will support and provide new opportunities for the regional economies in my home state of Western Australia as it transitions out of the mining boom.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">These reforms, importantly, will also enable Australian business to invest more of their earnings in employing more Australians and growing their businesses. This is a benefit for every Australian. Of course, we know that these reforms will also drive investment, allowing us to keep our living standards high and improve wages growth. Most importantly, these reforms will allow Australian businesses to once again be globally competitive. They will encourage business to remain in Australia and will provide an incentive for business to relocate to Australia.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Australia may be a geographic island, but we certainly cannot afford to be an economic one. Nor can we afford to believe that here in Australia investment will simply come because of our stable government and safe investment environment. But unfortunately the facts are these: it is no longer good enough just to be a safe destination. The Australian economy now resides in a new economic paradigm, one where ongoing investment is critical, as it is now one of the key drivers of productivity and future economic growth. It is a new paradigm in which a raft of other nations that were once considered high-risk places to invest are seeing a massive influx of capital—capital that Australia is being deprived of because other nations are looking more attractive. This is why encouraging enterprise must be the driving reform or driving force behind reform to Australia's tax system, especially in the area of company tax.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Australia's company tax rate has remained at 30 per cent for more than 15 years. Over that period many other countries have moved to reduce their rates, and I will explain that point in a moment. Fifteen years ago Australia had the ninth-lowest corporate tax rate amongst the advanced economies, and today only five of the 35 countries in the OECD have a corporate tax rate that is higher than ours. In 2014 Australia's taxation was 4.7 per cent of gross domestic product, while the OECD average was 2.8 per cent. What I am trying to demonstrate is that Australia's company tax rate is much too high by international standards. That hinders international investment and it deprives Australians of important economic growth opportunities and job opportunities in their communities.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">A high company tax rate means Australian companies have more difficulty in attracting much-needed capital to invest in their businesses—in their machinery, in their technology and in their workers. A high company tax rate environment means companies are less productive, and it means foreign investors are discouraged from doing business here in Australia. The Turnbull government's 10-year Enterprise Tax Plan begins with tax cuts for small and medium sized companies, most of which we know are family-run businesses, and will eventually lead to a flat tax rate of 25 per cent for all companies. This rate will be consistent with the current— (<span style="font-style:italic;">Quorum formed</span>)</span>

                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I am tempted to start at the very beginning of my speech again, but I only have six minutes. Let me do it in an abbreviated version before I get on to the more substantive issue. The substantive issue is what, in fact, other nations like Australia are doing—what Canada is doing, what the United Kingdom is doing, what Singapore is doing. Before I get to that, let me quickly recap on why there are still no Labor speakers on the speaking list—it is because they have something to hide—</span>

                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">

                    <span class="HPS-OfficeInterjecting">The DEPUTY PRESIDENT:</span>  Order! Senator Smith, I am sure you are well aware of the standing orders around props. Thank you.</span>

                      <span class="HPS-MemberContinuation">Senator SMITH:</span>
                    </a>  That is correct. Props are not allowed. But if you go to the <span style="font-style:italic;">Daily Telegraph </span>newspaper of 28 march you will see a very important page, a very important graphic, because it is headed: 'Do as we say, not as we do'. It carries a big image of Bill Shorten, the Leader of the Opposition, and a big photograph of numerous other leaders of the opposition parties in Australia—people like Mr Albanese, Mr Bowen, Senator Wong and, of course, former Labor Prime Minister Paul Keating. The point that the article is trying to make in the <span style="font-style:italic;">Daily Telegraph </span>is that, once upon a time—actually, not so long ago—the Labor Party in this country supported company tax reform, which is the exact same issue that we are talking about here today. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">So let me just talk about why it is important. It is not just important because the government believes this is the way to proceed; it is not just important because people like Senator O'Sullivan, Senator Hume, Senator Smith and, before us, Senator Back think it is important; it is important because what are our competitors doing internationally? They are not sitting around waiting for us to change our corporate tax rate. They have moved already and moved significantly. Let us look at some of those countries. I am going to touch briefly on the United Kingdom, New Zealand, Canada, Singapore and, of course, the United States of America. We know in the case of the United Kingdom that in 2010 the newly-elected government of the United Kingdom, faced with the aftermath of the global financial crisis and a budget deficit of around 10 per cent of GDP, reduced their tax rate from 28 per cent to 20 per cent. They reduced it by eight points and are scheduled to take it to 17 per cent by 2020. Why is that important? What happened as a result of that? Did the sky fall in? No. Did the economy hit the skids? No. I will tell you what happened. Britain's lower tax rates have supported a steady and sustained recovery in business investment, which has increased by nearly 25 per cent in the six years to March 2016 and reduced their budget deficit to around four per cent of GDP. In our country, we often look to the United Kingdom to get a measure of what things might work in a policy setting. On this issue, we can trust the experience of the United Kingdom, and the experience was that, by reducing company tax rates, they saw an improvement in their economy; they saw a better position in their budget recovery program. </span>

                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Let us look closer to home to Tasmania—</span>

                      <span class="HPS-MemberContinuation">Senator SMITH:</span>
                    </a>  As a Western Australian, I try not to look too much at Tasmania. Apologies to Senator Lambie, who is in the chamber. Let us look across the Tasman to New Zealand. What is New Zealand doing? New Zealand cut its company tax rate from 33 per cent to 28 per cent between 2008 and 2011, while also returning its budget to surplus. They are two examples of not just modest tax cuts; I would argue that these are significant and important corporate tax cuts, which delivered economic and budget benefits. We are being told that somehow the sky is going to fall in. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Let us look at Canada, a little bit further afield, but on many levels an economy very similar to ours. It is very heavily dependent on a natural resource base like our own and particularly like my home state of Western Australia. In Canada, they reduced their corporate tax rate from 36.1 per cent to 26.5 per cent. Singapore, again, closer to home, has reduced its corporate tax rate from 20 per cent to 17 per cent. Importantly, in the United States of America, we know that the election of President Trump is heralding a new corporate tax reform program, and their plan is to bring their current level of 35 per cent corporate tax rate to somewhere closer to 15 per cent. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">That brief contribution is about saying: if you do not trust Senator O'Sullivan, if you do not trust Senator Smith and if you do not trust Senator Hume, we get that; that is okay—but look at the international experience. However, there is one Australian people should trust, and it is that one Australian who is given that ultimate responsibility for stewarding our economy. That man—because it is a man at the moment; I think it has always been a man—that person is the Governor of the Reserve Bank of Australia. People can have their views, but he is a very esteemed individual, who has a great responsibility on their shoulders. His name is Philip Lowe, and, at the opening address of the A50 Forum earlier this year, he urged the Australian government, and I am sure he urged the parliament, to embrace corporate tax reform. In his speech he said: </span>

Corporate tax rates that are increasingly uncompetitive will make it harder for Australia to continue to attract the necessary investment, especially as our economy transitions from the mining investment boom to broader based economic growth. </span>

In this Senate chamber this afternoon, who are those who have an anti-Australian sentiment? Who are those who are standing in the way of jobs growth and in the way of improved future investment? They are the Labor senators on the other side, and they do not have to go too far back into their history to see they had a better record when it came to supporting corporate tax reform.</span>

Here we are talking about budget repair, and you are trying to tell us how other countries are doing it. But I will tell you what other countries are not doing; they are not spending a couple of days, on taxpayers' money, arguing over changing a couple of words when it comes to racial discrimination.

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Madam Deputy President, I rise to speak on the Treasury Laws Amendment (Enterprise Tax Plan) Bill 2016. The Turnbull government gives us an earbashing day in, day out about the need for company tax cuts. The problem is that no-one has ever proved to me that trickle-down economics works—let alone the fact that 579 corporations in Australia pay no company tax at all. That is right: zilch, zero, nothing, not one red cent. And who loses out?</span>

Here we have a public health system that is stretched to its limits, less money for those schools in need, and ridiculous situations like those faced by community legal centres where that funding is disappearing before their very eyes, and close to 600 corporations pay no tax—fair go! Where is the Australian way? Fair go! So please do not come in here and lecture us about the need for a better deal for corporate Australia until you fix the rules first.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">For example, here is an issue that needs to be fixed and explored. Australia now has an energy crisis on the east coast and there is no doubt that government inaction is to blame. We have the ridiculous scenario where, by 2019, Australia will be the world's largest exporter of LNG while we will not be able to keep the lights on at home. The fact is that we pay more than places like Japan—that is how ridiculous it is—which uses our gas. How do you weigh that one up? What has happened here? We have not only an energy crisis but also, according to you people, a budget crisis—although over the last couple of days I am not quite sure about that—once again due to the government sitting on its hands when leadership is required.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Small">The dip is unlikely to be a blip. Thanks to the way the government allows expenses to be deducted before a project makes a taxable profit, it could be decades before the country starts to receive a better return on its mineral wealth.

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">As it stands now, the petroleum resource rent tax, the primary tax on oil and gas production, will collect no revenue from the boom in LNG exports. At the same time, on the same volume, Qatar—this is the big one—currently the world's largest LNG exporter, will generate more than $26 billion in royalties from LNG, not including divided income from state owned companies or corporate income tax from foreign investors. We have done something seriously wrong here in this country. I would be holding my head in shame too—do not look at me, because I tell you what: there is something terribly wrong.</span>

So much for looking after our own backyard first. It is a typical story, a pattern of behaviour. Other countries have national policies in place to provide low-cost energy to support their local industry and local jobs. I have already told you: if you do not do something about our energy prices, our wages and conditions will pay the price. But our budget is also paying the price because of bad decisions that have been made year after year. You can only sell the farm gate once—I am sure the Nationals understand that. We are giving away our resources to the world's largest oil companies for free while we struggle to keep the lights on. How about that? This is an absolute disgrace and a national tragedy in itself.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Unlike our government, other governments have been smarter. Through state owned companies, they have invested in Australian gas resources. These investments are done in the name of ensuring national energy security in their home countries. For example, one-third of the output of the big CSG to LNG projects in Queensland is owned by foreign governments. Chinese companies, ultimately controlled by the Chinese communist party, own more than 17 per cent.</span>

Firstly, giving business a $50 billion tax cut means $50 billion less the schools, hospitals and other government services. Secondly, this tax cut means an extra $7.4 billion for the big four banks, which are some of the most profitable banks in the world already. You cannot argue with that. $7.4 billion to the big four banks? You cannot argue with that. The winners are tax avoiders and foreign shareholders because the benefits of the company tax mostly go to foreign shareholders, not to Australian shareholders, due to Australia's dividend imputation system.

But the Treasurer does not want to speak to me or the experts who have put it forward. That is the problem. He does not even want to look at it. You know why they don't they want to do that?

I for one was very enlightened. When Senator Lambie said that there is no correlation between lower taxes and more investment and more jobs, I saw the Greens nodding away furiously. I was looking forward to hearing Senator Ludlam's contribution because I was hoping that he might be able to get up and back up in his speech what he backed up with his interjections, which is that there is no correlation between lower company taxes and more jobs, more investment and higher wages. It was interesting. Senator Lambie, of course, quoted the Australia Institute, which is that well-known Greens think tank full of former Greens staffers and some left-wing trade union officials. We should, perhaps, put into some context when the Australia Institute comes up with something that backs what the Labor Party and the Greens are saying. It is no surprise that they would do that.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I will come to some of the people who believe that there is a correlation between lower company tax and more investment, more jobs, higher wages. There is a pretty significant body of evidence to that effect. One of the things we have heard in this argument was reflected a little bit in Senator Lambie's contribution, but we certainly heard it from the Labor Party and others. They put it as a binary choice. They say, 'You want to cut company tax.' In fact, they go further than that. They say, 'You want to have a handout to big business.' That is what they call a company tax cut now: a handout to big business. I want to deal with both elements of that. I will come back to that bit. They would say, 'You could be spending it on hospitals and schools and roads and all of those worthy things. The logic is that it is a handout. That is what the Labor Party and the Greens and others claim. It is the logic that, if you cut that, you have no money for other things. That suggests two things. It suggests two courses of action. One is that it suggests it is the government's money in the first place. That is what it suggests—indeed, I guess the same principle would apply for an income tax cut, if you were making that case—that all of the money that companies and individuals earn is somehow the government's money and the government can choose to allow them to keep some of it. That is the logic that is put out every time they use the term 'handout'. They are saying that it is their money, that it is the government's money. It is not. It needs to be earnt. It needs to be created, just as individuals need to earn money and it is their money, and of course they are forced to give some of their money to the government. Companies, of course, are forced to pay taxes. That is right, but we are enforcing on them a contribution from what they have created and what they have earnt. That is first principles when it comes to company tax and the ideas behind whether it is their money or whether it is the government's money. There are investors in companies, there are shareholders, there are employees, and all of them, in one way or another, share in the wealth. When you have companies that make no money, when you have companies that make a loss over a period of time, they go out of business, they employ no-one, they create nothing, and then there is also no corporate tax or any other revenue for governments to spend on really important things, like roads, defence, health, education and all of the other worthy things, which of course governments need to deliver on behalf of their communities. That should be the absolute first thing we say.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This is not a giveaway. This is about trying to reduce the amount of tax that companies pay, starting with small and medium enterprises and moving on to large businesses, so that they can be encouraged to invest more money in their businesses, so they can be encouraged to grow their businesses and so that they can be encouraged to employ more Australians. It is a sad reflection on the modern Labor Party that they have now walked away from that principle which, in their heart of hearts, they all know. We know that they have some knowledge of it, but they refuse to accept that it should now be done.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Before I go to what we have heard from well-known Labor figures on the issue of company tax, I want to address this issue. The criticism they make is it is a giveaway to big business. Firstly, it is not a giveaway. It is allowing companies to hold on to some more of their own money that they have created. Every serious economist, notwithstanding Senator Lambie's contribution, will tell you that it encourages greater investment, encourages more jobs and encourages higher wages. They claim it is a giveaway, but they also claim it is a big business giveaway.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The position that the Labor Party are putting on the record for this piece of legislation is that, if you have revenue or turnover of $2.1 million or more, you are a large business. I do not know how many local businesses members of the Labor Party talk to in their electorates, but to have a turnover of a tick over $2 million does not make you a large business—not by a long shot. But the Labor Party are seeking to deny that businesses of $2½ million, $3 million, $3½ million or $4 million are small businesses, which in my opinion they are. Then as we go to $10 million, $25 million or $50 million we are moving up to medium-sized businesses. The Labor Party are saying they are all large businesses and they should not get a tax cut.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">First, they are now denying what they know to be true—that company tax cuts have great benefits for the economy, great benefits for employees and great benefits when it comes to jobs. They are also claiming a local pharmacy, some cafes that are over the $2 million mark and any number of pretty ordinary mum-and-dad businesses with a few employees are now considered large businesses. Of course, with the argument that is being made by the Labor Party now, they are considered the enemy. Any business classified as large—and in Labor Party thinking that means over $2 million—is somehow the enemy. We do not see them as the enemy, be they a small business of $2 million, $2½ million or $5 million, a medium business or a large business, because we see them all making great contributions to our nation. We want our small businesses to become medium businesses and then large businesses, because we want them to employ more people. We want them to invest more in our nation. We want them to innovate, do great things and provide great products and services to our community.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">That largely does not come from government. There are certain things that government has to do and there are certain things government should do, but most of our products and services are actually delivered by the private sector. They are delivered by people starting businesses—taking risks, investing money, encouraging other people to invest some of their money and take a risk, and sometimes failing in striving to do that. But many times they come up with great products, great innovation and employ people, starting with a few people and sometimes moving up to hundreds, thousands or in some cases tens of thousands of Australians. That has been a big part of the story of who we are and we should not walk away from that.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">It is a sad state of affairs for modern Labor that they have today, and in the last few months in the discussion on this, completely walked away from these principles. There is a reason Paul Keating and Bob Hawke saw electoral success in the Hawke-Keating years. While I certainly did not agree with all of their policies by any stretch, you could look back historically and argue they also had some policy success.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">But you do not have to go back to 1993 and Paul Keating. There have been glimpses of this modern Labor Party acknowledging the truth of this. They have acknowledged why cutting company tax is actually good for workers. As recently as September 2015—so, in Labor's time in opposition, when you would think they would be taking stock of some of the massive failures they had as a government—former professor Andrew Leigh said:</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">We know the company tax rate is a significant drag on growth, largely because capital is more footloose than labour and so there's potential for us to miss out on high-quality investment if we have too high a company tax rate. </span>

                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">And Andrew Leigh was right. He was right then. He is wrong on a lot of things and he is wrong quite often, but he was right on that. He is part of this economic team which has now said, for some sort of rank political purpose, that it will now abandon this principle. I would say to not just Andrew Leigh but all of the Labor senators in this place and members of the Labor Party frontbench: is this the kind of future you want to create for Australia? Do you really want to see an Australia in five or 10 years time with less and less investment?</span>

                    </a>  It is quite disorderly for Senator Hanson-Young to be reflecting on the chair. Thank you for bringing her back into line. Senator Hanson-Young's interjections are all along the lines of: if you cut company tax, you are taking money away from this worthy cause or that worthy cause. Based on that logic—and we heard it before from Senator Lambie, we have heard it from other Greens in the chamber and we have heard it from Labor in this debate—I assume the Labor Party would be pushing to increase company tax. Because, if the rate of company tax really does not have any impact on investment and a tax cut is simply taking money away from other areas and there are no behavioural changes, then the logical thing would be to increase it. Presumably that would be Labor's policy, and of course it would be the Greens' policy, going forward. That would be even more disastrous. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We know that increasing company tax would be a disaster. In fact, if we keep it where it is when all of our competitors drop it, that will be effectively doing the same thing because we are going to see our competitiveness dropping rapidly as we see nations around the world dropping their company tax. You only have to have a look around the world at some of the rates. We have heard about how the United States are now planning on dramatically cutting their rate of company tax. We have seen Canada do it. We have seen the UK do it. We know that Singapore are around the 17 per cent mark, and they have seen it drop in recent years. So all of these advanced economies around the world have a lower rate, including New Zealand, Norway and Spain, and in many cases they have quite different economies. Some of our main competitors' economies are quite like us, like Canada, and some of them have economies that are advanced but have a different base: they have all seen the worth of lowering company tax. </span>

                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Senator Dastyari does not take much of what goes on in this place very seriously, but I would say to him and others: do you really want a future for your kids where they are going to have much lower job prospects? Julia Gillard said it. Julia Gillard said:</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">If you are against cutting company tax, you are against economic growth. If you are against economic growth, then you are against jobs.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">That is not a bad summation, coming from a Left-of-centre Labor leader. We certainly did not agree with much of Julia Gillard's agenda, but she understood this pretty basic fact. It is very difficult to find any sort of serious economist—you mind to drag out the Australia Institute on this—who would back up Senator Lambie's claim, and now it seems to be the claim of the Greens and Labor, that there is no correlation between cutting company tax and more jobs, more investment and higher wages. Senator Hanson-Young obviously believes that there is no correlation. Senator Lambie believes that, but perhaps that is to be expected. But the Labor Party, the alternate party of government in this nation, is now suggesting that cutting company tax has no benefits, implicitly suggesting that increasing company tax levels—</span>

                    </a>  It is the Labor Party now that is walking away from this principle. And what will it mean? I talked about the flight of capital. Chris Bowen understands this, even though he has now walked away from it. This is how irresponsible it is: he is fighting against something he knows to be in Australia's national interest. He absolutely knows it. He talked about our rate of company tax versus the rest of the world and the impacts of that. He said that we do not have to have the lowest corporate tax in the world, and, of course, cutting it over time to 25 per cent certainly will not make it the lowest in the world. He said we do, however, need to be concerned if our company tax rate is on the higher side of the world's advanced economies. The 30 per cent rate was reasonably competitive when it was first introduced, but since then other countries have reduced their rates, so the average across the world's economies is now 24 per cent. He goes on to say that it is a Labor thing to have the ambition of reducing company tax, because it promotes investment, creates jobs and drives growth.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">So we, the Senate, now have an opportunity to stand up for some good economic policy that is in the national interest. No serious person in this place or in this debate is not on the record as saying that there are significant benefits to be gained from cutting the company tax rate. Whether it was Julia Gillard or her predecessor in Paul Keating, whether it was Bill Shorten as opposition leader or Chris Bowen or an incredible economist, all agree that there are massive benefits and a significant downside to being uncompetitive. That is what we face if we get this kind of obstructionism. So I again says to the Labor Party that this is not a joke. This is not something that is just a game, as Senator Dastyari might see it. It is actually about whether or not his kids and my kids are able to find reasonable jobs and have the opportunity to see their wages rise, to have good living standards and also to have a thriving private sector that can innovate and deliver some of the great products that makes all of our lives better. Those things do not happen by accident. They happen because of the investment, the hard work and the efforts of thousands and thousands of people. Yes, it does need innovators. Yes, it does need entrepreneurs. Yes, it does need people who are prepared to take risks. Most of us are not massive risk takers, but we need people who are prepared to take risks to create businesses. We need people who are prepared to invest some of their own money. We need people who are prepared to provide products that encourage other people to invest and take some risks so that they can create great thing and along the way they can create jobs and grow our economy and see our living standards and our wages go up. These are serious matters that are before us in the Senate today. It is something that deserves to be supported. This legislation would lay a platform for a growing, prosperous and thriving Australia going forward for decades into the future. I commend it to the Senate.</span>

                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">
                    <a href="2O4" type="MemberSpeech">
                      <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Senator HINCH</span>
                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Victoria</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">14:19</span>):  Many government speakers in the Treasury Laws Amendment (Enterprise Tax Plan) Bill 2016 debate have talked about being competitive with the rest of the world. They are right. Australia, at 30 per cent, is way above the OECD average, which is about 24-point-something per cent and, coming into our area here, which is very important for trade: China is 25 per cent, Korea is 24.2 per cent, Thailand is 20 per cent, Singapore is 17 per cent, Hong Kong is 16.5 per cent, the UK is 20 per cent, and the new United States administration is talking about reducing the company tax to about 15 or 20 per cent.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I want to bring it closer to home, back into our region and into Australia itself. Originally I signalled to the government that I would support a reduction in company tax for companies in the $2 million to $10 million area. That was against my personal view, because my personal view is that within 10 years I would like to see company tax in Australia be reduced to 25 per cent for all companies. That will not happen, but I thought the plan put forward by the government at the last election to phase this in over 10 years was a responsible way to go. I thought the $10 million cap to get it started would be a good way to go.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Then I did some more research and realised that here at home some very decent companies in the $10 million to $50 million bracket would be hurt by the fact that we had capped it at $10 million. Going back to my home state of Victoria, which is very pertinent, there is a fifth-generation family company called Furphy—the ones who had the water coolers at Gallipoli—in Shepparton that employs 150 people. It would not get any advantage if we brought the cap in at $10 million. In Gippsland, which is really doing it hard at the moment, GippsAero in Traralgon have 75 people on their staff. They would not get any benefit from putting a cap on at $10 million. So I am more than happy to lift that cap to $50 million. I think that would be a wise way for this Senate to go.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The other point here is that many of us voted to put an amendment in that opposed any cuts to Sunday penalty rates. I voted with the opposition on this; I voted against the government. That will affect the bottom lines of businesses. They will not get any cut; they will not get any reduction. Those companies need relief in tough times. This move will increase employment by encouraging investment in equipment and in development, and presumably that would mean more jobs. The other issue here is that businesses are also facing more expenses coming up—legitimately—because there will be a minimum wage increase, which the workers deserve but that businesses have to pay for. That increase will be somewhere between the $8 that was recommended by the Business Council and the $45 that was asked for at the Press Club by the ACTU boss, Ms McManus.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">As I said before, there are increasing pressures on companies and workers, not only in regional Victoria but also in other regional areas of all states of Australia, and that is why there has to be some relief. This is why this will be a very good way to go. Lifting the threshold from $10 million to $50 million will mean that nearly 900,000 small- to medium-sized businesses and companies in this country will be better off. They will get tax cuts. Those 800,000-plus companies employ more than four million workers. I say today: give those companies a break.</span>

                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">
                    <a href="266499" type="MemberSpeech">
                      <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Senator HUME</span>
                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Victoria</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">14:23</span>):  I rise today to speak in support of the government's Treasury Laws Amendment (Enterprise Tax Plan) Bill 2016. This bill, as we all well know, is a key part of the Turnbull government's reform agenda, which will improve our tax system and drive investment in the Australian economy. The government's enterprise tax plan honours our 2016-17 budget commitments to progressively reduce tax rates for corporate entities over the coming decade. Although not all are being debated today, the elements of the government's tax plan include: an immediate reduction of the corporate tax rate to 27.5 per cent for the 2016-17 financial year for businesses with an aggregated turnover of less than $10 million; a progressive extension of this reduction in the corporate tax rate to all corporate entities, regardless of their size, by 2023-24 financial year; and further progressive reductions in the corporate tax rate to 25 per cent by the 2026-27 financial year. There are also consequential amendments to the dividend imputation scheme to keep franking credits aligned with the changes in the corporate tax rate; a progressive increase in the discount for unincorporated small businesses that is equivalent to the changes in the corporate tax rate; and also an increase in the aggregated turnover threshold for access to the small business tax concessions from $2 million to $10 million.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Today the Senate is asked to consider just the first step of this extensive tax plan and vote to ensure the immediate reduction of the corporate tax rate down to 27.5 per cent for businesses with an aggregated turnover of less than $10 million. This critical reform to Australia's corporate tax rate will ensure that the Australian economy is able to effectively transition from the largest mining investment boom in our history to a stronger and more diverse economy. It is absolutely essential that we reduce the burden of tax on Australian employers. It will improve their cash flow, allow them to reinvest in new equipment and machinery, take on new staff and pay higher wages to their existing employees. The eventual progressive reduction in the corporate tax rate for Australian businesses is a core element of the government's economic reform agenda. By returning the Turnbull government, the Australian people have given the coalition a mandate to implement its election commitments. And we have committed to ensuring that Australia's corporate tax rate remains internationally competitive. If Australia is to remain internationally competitive it is vital that we allow our businesses to compete on an equal footing to companies from overseas tax jurisdictions.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This is a government that supports investment and enterprise in the Australian economy. This is a government that supports investment in the future of Australia's economic prosperity. This is why the government has proposed the Enterprise Tax Plan to ensure the economic success of our nation. I am happy to report that I am not alone in my support for reducing company tax rates, and it is with great fondness that I recall the opposition leader's previous comments of support. In 2011 he said:</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">Cutting the company income tax rate increases domestic productivity and domestic investment.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Mr Shorten said:</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">More capital means higher productivity and economic growth, and leads to more jobs and higher wages.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Mr Shorten believes company tax cuts lead to more jobs and higher wages. When he was Minister for Financial Services and Superannuation, he said:</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">Any student of Australian business and economic history since the mid-1980s knows that part of Australia's success was derived through the reduction in the company tax rate.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I find it very convenient that during his time as Assistant Treasurer the Leader of the Opposition was wholly—and, indeed, vocally—supportive of the cuts to the corporate tax rate, telling us all about the positive effects such a move would have for wage and job growth. Yet now, in opposition, he conveniently touts the current economic situation as cause to oppose corporate tax cuts. It strikes me that the Leader of the Opposition is more beholden to political expediency than to the pursuit of sensible policy outcomes. I feel confident that the opposition leader was at that time merely toeing the line, sticking to his talking points and displaying a fleeting loyalty to the Prime Minister of the day. To now not support a reduction in corporate tax is truly bewildering. I ask the Leader of the Opposition: what has changed?</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The government's Enterprise Tax Plan will have a profound effect on our economy, including the creation of more Australian jobs. This legislation will reduce the tax burden for 870,000 incorporated businesses with a turnover of less than $10 million. These businesses currently employ more than 3.4 million Australians, representing over one-quarter of the employed labour force. The government recognises that improving cash flow to Australian businesses will have significant positive consequences to the economy, including the creation of more jobs.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Certified Practising Accountants Australia have also stated that there is clear evidence that a reduction in the corporate tax rate would help promote economic activity, promote jobs and growth, and increase prosperity for Australian workers. CPA Australia said on this subject that reducing the tax burden on businesses lifts productivity and increases both their competitiveness and their capacity to expand, and encourages job creation.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The Business Council of Australia also has pointed out that the benefits of the tax cuts would be widely shared. It said that Australian workers would be the biggest winners—not foreign shareholders; not the banks; not other big businesses. Australian workers will receive around two-thirds of the total gains because higher investment means more jobs and higher wages.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The government's enterprise tax plan will encourage investment. As we transition from the mining boom, it is vital that we give every business the opportunity to invest, to innovate, to grow, and to employ more Australians. We need a tax system that supports enterprise by backing businesses to invest. We need a tax system that puts more money back in the hands of businesses for capital investment.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The economic flow-on consequences of the government's enterprise tax plan are enormous. Higher investment will lead to permanent increases in wages, support for jobs and increased consumption, and will result in higher living standards. The changes are expected to permanently lift the level of GDP by just over one per cent in the long term.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">It is also important to note the substantial changes to the previous $2 million threshold for aggregated turnover, for access to small business concessions, to $10 million. As the institute of company affairs noted, an estimated 90,000 to 100,000 businesses will benefit from lifting this turnover threshold.</span>
                </p>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Importantly, too, such an expansion of the small-business concessions ensures that existing businesses that are near that $2 million threshold are incentivised to grow, as currently they would lose the concessions once they passed that threshold. Indeed, the Henry report—that tax manifesto of the previous Labor government—recommended that small business concessions be extended further as part of a desire to see a more efficient tax system. That was the Henry report.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">While those opposite might like to argue the politically expedient point of limiting the tax cuts to businesses that meet the current definition of 'small business'—those with aggregated turnover of less than $2 million—the government is interested in delivering good policy outcomes which will benefit our country. To limit the reduction in company tax to only a small segment of Australia's incorporated businesses would be to stifle the effectiveness of the policy itself and reduce the ability of almost 100,000 additional businesses to invest in and grow their business more. If the Labor Party were genuinely interested in encouraging employment and wages growth, as they say they are, then they would support the government's proposal to reduce the company tax rate for businesses with an aggregated turnover of less than $10 million, not just $2 million.</span>

                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The government's enterprise tax plan is one that recognises and accounts for the significant proportion of small businesses that are not incorporated. The government's enterprise tax plan acknowledges the 73 per cent of small businesses that choose to operate outside of corporate entities. This plan will ensure that the discounts are extended to those various legal structures, such as partnerships and trusts, through which small businesses are very commonly operated. The plan ensures that the majority of small businesses which are not incorporated are adequately incentivised to reinvest their capital to wage growth and job creation.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">To ensure the growth rates that Australia needs, the reduction in the corporate tax rate prescribed in the coalition's enterprise tax plan will not only be limited to small business entities. The government's enterprise tax plan, though initially reducing the tax rate for small businesses only, hopefully progressively returns to a flat corporate tax rate of 25 per cent in the 2026-27 year. This parliament must not be tempted to restrict the corporate tax rate reductions to small business entities only, despite the political appetite to do so from those opposite.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The Business Council of Australia noted that restricting the tax cuts to smaller businesses would mean missing out on the bulk of the investment gains and barely improving our global competitiveness. Political pressure to restrict the tax cuts to small businesses would lock in a two-tier company tax system and provide for perverse incentives for business to inefficiently structure themselves purely for tax purposes. For the Australian economy to be the beneficiary of renewed investment in capital and in growth and to ensure that we successfully transition from the mining investment boom, it is vital that company taxes across the board are reduced. </span>

                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Today's bill is the first step in the government's enterprise tax plan, which will incentivise all businesses, big and small, to invest in capital, business, jobs and growth. Most importantly, it is vital that Australia act to reform our corporate tax regime in order to ensure ongoing competitiveness in the global marketplace. This is an issue about which we have heard much today. Reform of Australia's company tax rate is critical to maintaining our international competitiveness and ensuring that we are able to incentivise investment in our economy. Only five OECD nations have corporate tax rates higher than Australia—only five. Our tax on business is much higher than our neighbours in our region. Our prohibitively high corporate tax rates act to discourage investment and are a disincentive to enterprises within Australia. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">For Australia to maintain the strong and internationally focused economy from which we have for so long been the beneficiary, we must act immediately to ensure that our company tax regime remains internationally competitive. Let us be clear about this: to remain uncompetitive in this space hurts Australian workers. In a modern international economy, capital and labour are highly mobile. Australia's uncompetitive corporate tax rate of 30 per cent compares dismally with the Asian average of 22 per cent and the OECD average of 24 per cent. Businesses, Australian and foreign, are taking their investment, their enterprise, their innovation and their jobs elsewhere. </span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The Minerals Council of Australia produced a report in which they demonstrate Australia's global tax uncompetitiveness by reference to a range of company tax rates in the industrialised world. I refer to that report now. The Minerals Council states that Australia's 30 per cent tax rate is the 10th highest rate of 43 countries sampled. Australia's rate exceeds the simple average statutory company income tax rates in the G20, which is 28.3 per cent, and the OECD, which is 24.8 per cent. While Australia has not changed its company tax, the average G20 and OECD rates have dropped between one and 1.1 percentage points respectively between 2010 and 2017. So when accounting for all tax provisions related to investment decisions, Australia is in fact the 36th least tax competitive country, which equates to the seventh highest tax burden in the world. We are such a successful economy, and yet we are the seventh highest tax burden in the world. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The MCA also note that, where, on average, OECD nations have been reducing tax burdens on investment, Australia's position has changed very little. In light of this, the reduction in company tax rates will safeguard our international competitiveness and boost investment in Australian businesses. The Minerals Council of Australia repeats the sentiments of the opposition leader: when a country is able to attract more capital, years of income for workers is generated. If the ALP's credentials as a party of the worker are to be believed, they must support this government's initiative to create further employment for Australian workers. </span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">A recent global competitiveness report from the World Economic Forum highlights the higher rates of income and corporate tax rates as the biggest impediment to Australia's international competitiveness. Australia can compete globally in this space, and it is imperative for the future success of our economy that this parliament act now to reduce or corporate tax rate. </span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">It was only earlier this month that President Trump signalled his intention to move on the matter of delivering broad tax cuts in the United States, after suffering the congressional defeat of his healthcare reform agenda. As the president turns his attention to delivering the substantial business tax cuts that he promised during the election, it is vital that Australia does not hamstring its own businesses by preventing them from competing in an international market. There is an element of urgency to these reforms, if Australia is to be allowed to be competitive in globalised international markets.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">What is the Labor alternative? I can tell you what the Labor alternative is: there isn't one. Bill Shorten and Labor have rejected the government's enterprise tax plan and want to deny small businesses and their hardworking employees access to further investment and growth opportunities. Mr Shorten consistently claims that we do not need an enterprise tax plan because education will deliver a bigger and more immediate economic benefit. Labor misrepresents the benefits of education over a more competitive tax rate. In the long term education is vitally important, yes, but we need short- to medium-term increases in the private sector. Economic growth will create the jobs for our more highly educated and better trained young Australians. The national accounts show that falling investment continues to be a drag on the economy, and that is why this bill is so desperately important, why we must drop our corporate tax rate as a matter of urgency.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">KPMG have also done some modelling on the reduction in the Australian corporate tax rate. Their modelling was of a rate down at 22 per cent. They found that overall, if we dropped our corporate tax rate to 22 per cent, our economy would in fact grow by two per cent. Investment would rise by 3.7 per cent—an enormous amount—and there would be thousands of new jobs created for Australians. This is an extraordinarily powerful indicator of the strength and the efficacy of the government's enterprise tax plan. To put it simply, there is no greater mechanism by which the government can effectively and assuredly set conditions for economic growth in Australia.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We as Australians cannot afford to sit idly on our hands while our international competitiveness is eroded. Inertia is simply no longer an option. Since our nation's birth we have relied on foreign investment. The government's enterprise tax plan will ensure that foreign investment does not bypass Australia and flow to lower-tax jurisdictions in our region. The enterprise tax plan will ensure that the Australian economy is able to compete on the global stage, encouraging investment and enterprise and fostering the growth of Australian jobs and Australian wages.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I implore those opposite to follow their leader's fine example in supporting this reduction in the Australian company tax rate, for those same reasons that he so eloquently articulated during his time as Assistant Treasurer.

                      <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Senator FAWCETT</span>
                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">South Australia</span>—<span class="HPS-MinisterialTitles">Deputy Government Whip in the Senate</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">14:43</span>):  I also rise to address the Treasury Laws Amendment (Enterprise Tax Plan) Bill 2016, which underpins the Turnbull government's Ten Year Enterprise Tax Plan. What I would like to do is outline briefly some details as to what the plan is but, more importantly, talk about why the plan is important to all sectors of our economy but particularly in the short term to the small business sector. I will talk a little bit about the international experience of tax plans, consider the other views within Australia's political system on tax and, regretfully, come to the conclusion that the opposition of the Labor Party at the moment is purely driven by politics, as opposed to any basis in policy. That stems from their views on this when they were in government.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">What the government is seeking to do with this 10-year Enterprise Tax Plan is to look at reducing company tax. I will get to why in a minute, but the aim is, by 10 years, to have reduced that from 30 per cent down to 25 per cent and, for small business, to accelerate their ability to have a lower tax rate.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The important thing is that we will be lifting, for small business, the aggregated income, or turnover, from $2 million to $10 million. What is important to remember is that this is a gross figure; this is not a net figure. Some people would look at that and think, 'Gosh, anyone who's making $2 million a year doesn't deserve a tax break,' but that is turnover. That is not profit. By the time you take out all the costs—operating costs, capital depreciation, stock, wages et cetera—you are not necessarily talking about people who are incredibly well off, but they are the people who employ the majority of Australians. If you look at the employment statistics, small business is the sector that provides the most openings for Australians to get work, so it is a really important sector that we should be supporting. With the lower tax rate if that threshold, that gross aggregated figure, were lifted to $10 million, there would be some 870,000 companies, and that equates to about 3.4 million Australians who would be positively affected by these companies being able to invest more into their business.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Over the 10-year period out to 2026-27, the government would gradually extend that decrease in company tax rate down to 25 per cent for all companies. Bearing in mind that not all small businesses are actually incorporated as companies, the government would extend the unincorporated small-business tax discount in a commensurate manner to encourage those companies.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Why are we doing this? Australia is a small and open economy. Australia's living standards and the quality of the services that we provide rely on our economy growing and the GDP increasing, and that is all linked to trade, to labour productivity, to labour force participation and to population. There is much evidence to indicate that corporate tax rates have a significant influence on each of those factors. Australia's corporate tax rate is high compared to many countries that we compete with for investment, particularly those in the Asia-Pacific region. If we do not attract that investment, then we will not see the opportunities growing.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">You only have to read the papers from the last week or two to see a number of companies that have struggled that have received a boost of foreign capital that has enabled them to continue operations, keep their doors open and keep Australians employed—or indeed to grow and expand their operations. There are a number of areas where it is foreign capital that has enabled a start-up in the first place which then provides opportunities for Australians to work.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">So ongoing investment is an important feature in terms of productivity growth and jobs growth, which grow our GDP. It is only when that economy grows that we can afford to spend the money we want to spend on the health, the education and the other services that Australians deserve and want to have. But you cannot put the egg in front of the chicken. It actually needs the private sector to be generating that growth in order to be able to fund that in a sustainable manner. On the concept that governments can just keep borrowing or increasing the tax burden, which ultimately falls on individuals, not just companies: there are countless examples domestically and overseas that show that that is not a sustainable model. You need private sector investment and growth if you want your tax base to be sustainable, which is the only way you can sustain the delivery of services and the standard of living that Australians want.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">As to the issue of small business and this turnover figure, whilst I currently chair the Joint Standing Committee on Foreign Affairs, Defence and Trade, in the last parliament I chaired the Parliamentary Joint Committee on Corporations and Financial Services. We did an inquiry into bank loans to small business and that gave me the opportunity to interact with a lot of small businesses around the country. When you are talking about a company, and particularly when you are talking about turnovers of millions of dollars, people tend to think of a corporation, being a large company with a headquarters and lots of staff. There are lots of companies in Australia that are run by mum and dad—the bookkeeper is mum and dad at 10 o'clock at night, when they have finally done the day's business, done the homework with the kids, got them into bed, and they can sit down and do the books. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Just because it is only mum and dad does not mean that their turnover is necessarily low. We looked at a range of businesses that came to us and talked about their relationship with banks, we looked into the kind of capital requirements they had to either start up or expand, and we looked at the cash flows that they had. What became very obvious was that the $2 million threshold is well out of date—it does not reflect the reality of business in today's environment. Remember that these are aggregated turnovers; they are not net profits—and there are many companies that are being disadvantaged at the moment and restricted in their ability to grow, and it is not the big end of town. We are often talking about your neighbour up the road who has a company that might just be mum and dad, or they might employ 10 people or 30 people. There are a number of companies in my home state of South Australia that are considered good local companies that employ between 50 and 100 people that should be qualifying for these benefits but even at the $10 million mark some of these would fall outside in terms of gross turnover. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">It is really important as we consider this debate to understand that the rhetoric that comes from those opposite that says the government is just giving tax cuts to the big end of town is just not true. In the vast majority of cases we are giving tax cuts to the mums and dads and the family businesses that employ the majority of Australians because it is a fact that has been backed up by both Australian and international experience that lowering the tax rate does encourage business to invest in its people, leading to more jobs and higher productivity, which then helps grow our economy as well as providing a living for more Australians. The concept that small business people are just somehow going to boost their profit incredibly and then all go off and live in mansions somewhere is just not borne out by the facts. The majority of business owners that I spoke to in that inquiry over the past three years highlighted that where they did employ staff the staff were the ones critical to making the business work. If they did not have good staff, the business did not do well. The way that they attracted and retained good staff was to pay, often, above and in some cases well above award conditions. A business that is doing well is almost always a business that is looking to recruit staff and to train them and to retain them, which also means paying them well. There is a cycle there of investment and growth that comes from giving the business that ability to invest in that way.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">What is the overseas experience with that? The OECD, which is often used in debates in this place as a reference point in terms of independent but informed thinking about these measures, have said:</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">Corporate income taxes are the most harmful for growth as they discourage the activities of firms that are the most important for growth: investment in capital and productivity improvements.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Their conclusion is that high rates of corporate tax distort investment decisions and undermine economic growth.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The UK is probably a good exemplar for Australia to look at. According to the UK government, as they look at their recent recovery—and they have had a good recovery; they have seen business investment and jobs growth—they credit as a central part of that the fact that they took the main rate of corporate taxation from 28 per cent down to 20 per cent. That has been a key driver of their economy. Oxford University, in its studies of this whole process, has found that that drove increased business investment by around 11 billion pounds. Importantly, in 2013 the UK government did modelling and published the analysis looking at the long-term economic impacts of these cuts to tax rates—in their case, from 28 down to 20 per cent. What they found is that that could increase the GDP by between 0.6 and 1.3 per cent, which is roughly equivalent with the expectations of cuts here of around one per cent. Again, it is growth in GDP that provides, on a sustainable basis, the ability for governments here in Australia to provide the standard of living and the quality of services that Australians need.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The alternative is to say, 'We're going to increase services, whether through welfare or through other areas, without having regard as to how we're going to pay for it in a sustainable manner.' If you start saying, 'We'll pay for it by increasing company tax rates or not giving them the breaks they need to be able to invest and employ,' over time, perversely, you undermine the ability of the government to sustain those services. If you borrow today to pay for education services, in years to come the children will be saying, 'Fantastic, but there's no work because companies are not investing here and creating the jobs.' I think it is good that under this government we have seen continued growth in funding for health, education and other areas. The rate of growth is not as high as we perhaps would like, but we need to have the commensurate measures that will see Australia's economy grow on a sustainable basis so that we can afford to have the investment in our workforce and the investment, eventually, back into the higher growth rates in those other areas.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Are we alone in this? Obviously not, when you look at the international experience. I just talked about the OECD and Oxford University and the UK government, and we have seen neighbouring countries like Singapore reducing their rates to 17 per cent.</span>

                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">If all of that experience and that informed opinion says it is a good thing to do, members of the Australian public would probably quite reasonably ask the question: why is the opposition not supporting the government's measures in this area? I regret to say that my only conclusion is that it is rank politics. Members opposite are very quick when they are in opposition to play class warfare. Hence their attacks on the Prime Minister about his position and success as a businessman and their constant talk in this place about supporting the big end of town et cetera. But the real question about the validity of the policy, surely, is: what was their position when they were in government. The Leader of the Opposition at the moment, Mr Bill Shorten, was the Assistant Treasurer when Labor were in government. It is worth looking back and asking: when he was in government, what was his view? I quote from Mr Shorten:</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Small">Cutting the company income tax rate increases domestic productivity and domestic investment. More capital means higher productivity and economic growth and leads to more jobs and higher wages.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">He said that in the parliament in 2011. When he was the Minister for Financial Services and Superannuation, Mr Shorten said on Sky News in March 2012:</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">Any student of Australian business and economic history since the mid-80s knows part of Australia's success was derived through the reduction in the company tax rate.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Small">We need to be able to make life easier for Australian business, which employs two in every three Australians.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Mr Shorten believed that only couple of years ago when they were in government. But now, when they are in opposition, they are coming out so stridently and not supporting the policy, saying, 'It's just the coalition government supporting the big end of town.' That is a red flag that this is just political opportunism, as opposed to what they really understand to be true in terms of what is good for the economy. It is not just Mr Shorten.

                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech" style="font-weight:bold;">, which he wrote in 2013, had a whole chapter titled 'Promoting growth through cutting company tax'. This is what Mr Bowen said in that chapter, very aptly named in the context of this bill, in his book:</span>
                  </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">… Keating knew that the corporate tax rate needed to be cut to make Australia competitive, that capital and investment would flow to tax-competitive nations and that this was an important job-creation move. Today capital is even more mobile than it was then and it is important that our corporate tax rate is competitive.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">What we see from members opposite is that when they are in government they also look around the world at the OECD, at nations such as the UK, Singapore and the United States. They see both the economic theory and the practice, and they support, not just in the odd comment but through very deliberate statements—in the case of Mr Bowen, through whole chapters in books that he has written—putting forth on the public record what they really believe about economic theory. And what they really believe is that the government's tax plan is actually the right approach for Australia.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Members of the public who are listening to this debate should not be misled by the rhetoric from those opposite that this government is preferring 'the big end of town' to the Australian worker, because the Labor Party knows—Mr Shorten knows, because he said it himself again and again when he was in government—that the best thing that we can do for Australian workers and Australian families in terms of having a well-paid job and growing our economy so that we can afford the services, the funding for education and health, and the standard of living that we want, is to encourage investment in business here. All of the evidence that we have used to underpin this also underpinned Labor's attitude towards corporate tax rates when they were in government, and it says that lowering tax rates is the best way to support Australian families and Australian workers. So I would encourage the Australian public, as they look at this debate going on, to realise that the rhetoric from the other side is rank political opportunism. Labor sees an opportunity to use class warfare to try to say that the government is out of touch, when in actual fact the government is doing the prudent thing in seeking to encourage investment. As Labor knows, as Labor itself has said, this is the best thing for small business and for big business because it creates more and better paid jobs for everyday Australians.</span>

                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Queensland</span>—<span class="HPS-MinisterialTitles">Assistant Minister to the Prime Minister</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">15:07</span>):  Smaller government, lower taxes, greater freedom and the rule of law are not just words; they are the concepts, the values, by which this government is running this country. When we talk about smaller government, that is because we believe that people are the best at making decisions on how they should govern their lives. When it comes to lower taxes, we believe that money is best in a man or woman's pocket rather than being spent by the government. When it comes to greater freedom, we believe that too much freedom is never enough. When it comes to the rule of law, we believe that all should be equal before the law and the law should apply equally to all. This debate today is about this government delivering on a key election promise that we would cut taxes for businesses. Businesses, whether small or large, are the engine room of Australia. They provide the jobs, they provide the money; they are the engine room that drives this country along.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We are in the midst of class warfare at the moment, where business is seen as bad: 'Business does bad things, we must shut business down.' This new leftist anti-business ideology has crept in from the watermelons in the Greens party and has taken over the Labor Party. That is bad for Australia, because business is good. I am proud to stand here and say I love business. I love small business, I love medium business, I love big business. Do you know why? Because they give jobs to people. They allow people to work and earn money in order to look after their families, prosper and grow. But, more importantly—and I will touch upon this later—small business, which I am a particularly big fan of, allows anyone who has a dream to start a business and see that business grow. It is sad that the Senate is trying to block the government from delivering on its key election promise to deliver tax cuts for small businesses, medium businesses and large businesses.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Politicians have a pretty bad reputation and it is probably deserved some times and undeserved at other times, but here is a political party, the Liberal-National Party, which went to an election with a key manifesto pledge that we had a tax enterprise plan and that we would cut taxes for small businesses, for medium businesses and for large businesses. We went to the Australian people and the Australian people said, 'Yes, do it.' In my home state of Queensland, my party—the Liberal-National Party—got 54 per cent of the vote. We got 29 out of 30 seats in Queensland, but what we are being told here is that the Senate is obstructing us in delivering on our promise, and that is very disappointing.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">When the four horsemen of the apocalypse come, and surely they will, when judgement day is before us all, we will be divided into two groups. Whether you believe in god or the deity of your choice, we will be divided into two groups: those who believe in freedom and those who do not believe in freedom. Quite frankly, those who do not believe in freedom, I do not really care what happens to you because you deserve to go downstairs. For those of us who believe in freedom—and there actually is freedom of thought, freedom of belief, freedom of speech, freedom of assembly, freedom of religion and the freedom to start a business—we believe that people are the ones who have the best ability to decide in terms of what they should think and what they should say and how they should, and what they can write and whether they should join a union or not join a union, whether they should assemble on the town common and speak and have a protest march or stay at home and watch <span style="font-style:italic;">The Big Bang Theory</span>. It is up to the individual to decide what they do.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Last night, in terms of how we are seeing the new leftist agenda trying to take over Australia—because it is doing so well with Jeremy Corbyn in the UK—the leftists in the Labor Party and the Greens are looking at Jeremy Corbyn and they are licking their lips and saying, 'Yes, we can have a proper left-wing agenda here.' They are looking at the other noted left-wing statesman, Bernie Sanders; they are looking at Venezuela and looking at what we can do by raising taxes, by restricting the freedom of people. We saw that here last night. The two debates we were having here over the last 24 hours were so instructive. The first debate last night was about freedom of speech. The debate today is about the freedom of people to start a business and for us to lower the taxes for those people who want to start a business, because we believe business is good. And then last night we had the gormless gibbons making outrageous allegations because we believe in freedom of speech, because we believe that people have the right to say things, even when we disagree with them. The true test of a society is not the freedoms that you give to people with whom you heartily agree—people you would have at home to have a rum and Coke, sit around outside and smell the frangipanis; it is the rights that you give to the people with whom you passionately disagree.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The problem we face here in Australia is that the political correctness that has overtaken certain political parties and has overtaken certain elements of the media means that certain thoughts, like freedom of speech, are becoming no longer permissible. We have franchised thought, that you can only believe in certain things. If the blob that is the media or the intelligentsia agree with you, you can have those thoughts and they will approve of you having those thoughts and they will heartily agree with you, but, if you utter something with which they disagree, they say, 'We can't have freedom of speech. No, we can't have freedom of speech, thank you very much.' What disappointed me about the debate last night was that it was certainly more than impugned; it was declared that, because we believe in freedom of speech and because we believe that certain people, no matter how much of a bunch of ratbags they are, have the right to say ratbag comments and give ratbags speeches, those on the Left say—I do not want to say it was tortured logic; it was actually outrageous slander—that we must also be racist. The implication was that, because we believe in freedom of speech, we were defending the right of people to speak and therefore we were joining in their disgraceful and disgusting comments.</span>

When I was a spotty-faced 15-year-old, my sister and I were going around the streets of Toowoomba with our own little business, painting gutters. McGrath Gutter Painters never became a multinational.

                    </a>  Yes, it should have been a multinational. The issue with small business, or with anyone who starts a small business in their garage—whether it is Henry Ford, before there were garages, or whether it is Mr Jobs and Apple—is that they start their businesses and they want them to grow. They want the small businesses to become medium businesses and they want the medium businesses to become large businesses, because that is what you do in business. The larger your business is, the more people you can employ and the more you can do for your community. What we are trying to do here is to cut taxes, because cutting taxes is a good thing. We should cut more taxes. We should give more money back to businesses. We should give more money back to people so they can use the money to make their own decisions in terms of how they run their lives, not with a government telling them what that money should be spent on.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The debate today clearly shows the dividing line between the sensible side of Australian politics, which just happens to be on this side of the chamber, and the new leftists on that side of the chamber—the Corbynistas, the Bernie Sanderses and the Bill Shortens—who do not believe in business, who do not believe that people should have the right to open a business and grow that business. Those on the Left, when you think about it, want to increase taxes. They want to grow taxes. The only thing the Left want to do in Australia is grow taxes. We want to grow jobs and we want to grow businesses because that is good for the Australian economy. It is the best thing for the Australian economy.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We saw what happened in terms of how Labor treated penalty rates and their reaction to that—remember that, ladies and gentlemen. Remember a guy called—what is his name?—Bill Shorten, the Leader of the Opposition. Labor sent to the Fair Work Commission an inquiry into penalty rates, which was decided upon by Labor appointees on a body that was established by the Labor Party. The body came back with recommendations in relation to penalty rates, and guess what Labor did? They said: 'No, we're not going to accept that. We're not going to accept that because we don't accept the inquiry.' We do not accept that, because you do not understand what it is like to start and operate a small business in Queensland or any part of Australia in terms of the impact that penalty rates can have. What we are seeing here today is that you do not understand the positive impact that cutting taxes will have for small businesses, for medium businesses and for big businesses.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">It is interesting how Labor have tried to frame this debate. You have framed it around 'those evil, faceless multinationals and those evil bankers'. But you have not spoken about the small businesses. You have not spoken about the medium businesses. You have not spoken about those businesses which employ millions of Australians. You have not spoken about the work they go through each day and each night, because you do not understand the business world. You do not understand it at all. No-one in the Labor Party and no-one in the Greens—with an honourable exception—really understands what it is like to run a small business and that sometimes, quite often, more often than not, you go without to make sure that you look after your staff, and you go without to make sure that your bills are paid. What we want to do here is make sure that business, which is the engine of Australia—it is what employs people; it is what provides the money to fund our public services—is given a tax cut so it can continue to grow and it can continue to employ people.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">It is very interesting to look at who sits on either side of the dispatch box in the other place. We have Malcolm Turnbull and Barnaby Joyce. Barnaby Joyce is a country accountant, someone who started his own practice out at St George. He understands what it is like to run a small business, to start from scratch, to get that shingle and put it out the front of some rented premises and to get some signs and go, 'This is my business.' You know what? It is so exciting starting a business, but it is also completely terrifying because there is always the thought that Labor may win another election, and they will increase taxes, increase red tape and grind business back into the ground because all the Left can think about is that productivity and efficiency and growth come from government. They do not come from government. The best thing about Australia is business. The best thing about Australia is small business especially, because small business provides jobs. <span style="font-style:italic;">(Quorum formed)</span></span>

                    </a>  The Greens? Yes, we will give them a tick there—maybe half a tick or a quarter of a tick—but Labor does not understand business. This is the issue that we face in Australia at the moment. We have had the Labor Party come together as a union reunion, this union blancmange, in the Senate—a retirement home for union hacks as part of some factional deal. They come here and they do not understand how to fill out simple forms, like a business activity statement—if I asked Labor what the letters BAS stood for I know they would say that they don't know and would not understand it. They would get their Google out and try to type the letters in to see what it means.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This is the issue we face here, because we do want to help business. We are being very sincere about this. We took this key pledge to the election as part of our enterprise tax plan—that over 10 years we would cut taxes for business and we would start off with small and medium businesses. We know that Australia is no longer its own little island by itself. We are competing with countries all around the world. When you look at the United Kingdom, their company tax rate is 20 per cent. We look at some of the Asian countries, where they are in the teens. We want to attract investment to this country. We want to attract people here to spend money to help create jobs, but they look at our company tax rate, which is 1970-esque in terms of British tax rates. It is too high and it scares people away. More importantly, we want to cut taxes for small and medium businesses because we understand that that is where millions of Australians work—it is where millions of Australians earn their money to look after their families. It is in the country towns and in the suburbs. When you go down the strip malls and into the large shopping centres and they are small businesses. Whether it is a McDonalds franchise or an independent burger shop, they are small businesses and they employ Australians.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">It is our duty to cut taxes for them, because when we cut taxes for them they can grow, they can employ more Australians and they can start up more businesses. I want every small business in Australia not just to be a small business. I want every small business in Australia to become a medium business and I would love every medium business to then become a large business, because who knows where the future Myers is or the future Ford, Google and Facebook are. They probably have not been discovered yet, but if we keep putting up taxes on them it will be harder for them to be discovered. Let us cut tax now.</span>

                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Queensland</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">15:34</span>):  I am really pleased to see my two good friends from the Labor Party come down to listen to my contribution. Senator Sterle had told me that he had to slip out because he had five dollars each way on a horse called Pink Batts in the fifth at Wangaratta. Of course, that is a segue for me to speak about economic attitudes within the Australian Labor Party, or lack thereof. I hope not to reflect on it too seriously. I must make a mental note to ask the whip to never put me on the speaking list after Senator McGrath. What a sterling contribution. It attracted not one but two quorum calls from the Greens. That takes a bit of doing. I got your third one accidentally, but I am going to take that and I am hoping that they dislike me enough to do at least one more and maybe two. You have 20 minutes of me, so sit there, kick your shoes off and have a listen, because I am about to give you people a lesson in basic economics. </span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The best way to do this is to start right at the beginning. If you have a sharp pencil over there you should pick it up and get yourself a clean piece of paper. We will use only the three numbers. We are not going to put the intellect under any sort of pressure. There are three numbers: one, two and three. Just write them down and follow the script: one plus one equals two and one plus two equals three. They are the simple formulas. They are the only important formulas. I am pleased to see you nod, because the one that you missed and that you people miss all time is one minus three, which leaves minus two, or in your case a $300 billion legacy where you and you and you—through you, I should say, Acting Deputy President, to him, him and him—borrowed, on behalf of the next two generations of Australians, to spend on the administration of this nation on Pink Batts and school halls money this country did not have. How were you able to do that? How were you able to borrow $300 billion? I will tell you how. When they came into the place they went straight to the passbook and whipped it open and what did they see? They saw black ink. That is what they saw. There had not been any red ink, because Prime Minister Howard and Treasurer Costello had laboured away over nine years to whittle away the last debt legacy that they left this nation. Don't go fellas, don't go. Do you want me to pause until you get up to your room and you can watch this on the television? I will get you a copy of the <span style="font-style:italic;">Hansard</span>.</span>

                    </a>  I do intend to take that interjection that occurred while the quorum was going, because it really goes to the heart of this. A reference was made to me by a senator in here in relation to my personal circumstances. As I have often said, the only family poorer than mine was the family I married into. We had nothing—and I mean 'nothing'. When my wife and I married, at 18 years of age, everything we owned was in the boot of a Cortina. I have been blessed in life. I did not win the pools. I avoided drug dealing. I have been an honest businessmen all my life and I have achieved something. As a result, I know a little bit about economic issues and about business. And I know this—and this is the other note you need to put under the '1, 2, 3': if you spend more money than you make, you are going to go broke, you are going to go belly up.</span>

People talk in this place about caring about these people up here, these young men and women—it is men and women; I cannot see that far; yes, it is indeed young men and women. They are the ones who are going to pay for the mistakes that—through you, or at you, Mr Acting Deputy President Marshall—you made before this government received this legacy. Honestly, I said it the other day and I will say it again: if some of you put your hand in your pocket and found a 10-pound note, you would have someone else's pants on. </span>

They are very intelligent. Some of them are decent—not all of them but a lot of them are decent people. But all they have done is made a profession of taking something off someone else.

We do not have any lines on the page. We look after the bush and the city. We look after the provincial. We look after it all the same, not like the Labor Party in my home state. None of their senators have come in here to make a contribution today about the businesses across my state. Do you know why? They are out there on Google, trying to find out what is on at the Gold Coast tomorrow, because that is where they live. They have never seen a kangaroo. They have never had a dent in the fender from a kangaroo, and there is a reason for that. Unless a kangaroo escapes from the golf course down there at Surfers Paradise, those opposite are never going to get within striking distance of it. They had one senator up in North Queensland, and what did they do? Choppy, choppy, choppy. She woke up, sat up on the edge of her bed and her head was still on the pillow. That is what the Labor Party does to people who represent people in regional areas. </span>

That is what you have done. You have set us apart. There are tens of millions of Australians who can now make a decision.

                    </a>  No, I started with him. You do not understand the economy. You do not understand what makes a business tick. Before I came to this place I employed 200 people—and that firm is still going—and then there were probably another 60 or 70 subcontractors and their staff. Do you know how we were able to build that business from nothing, from the back seat of a Cortina? I made money. I generated a profit. I reinvested it in the business. That is what I did. What does 'reinvestment' mean? It means that I bought things for my business. I structured my business. And then I parted with that money to other businesses to do that for me. I bought lumber. I bought tin. I bought concrete. I hired subcontractors to dig holes for me. That is where it went. What did they do with it? They gave it to their employees. This is how the economy works. When I made a few more bob and I cleared the hurdle, I spent it again. I bought more concrete. Then I had to employ more staff to manage the volume of concrete I was buying. That is what I did over a long period of time. </span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I do not want to reflect on my two friends, and I hope I have not ruined their dual careers as a result of this, but let me say this: I have invited the Labor Party and the Greens to tell me about this before. I asked them to show me one of them who has employed anybody and to show me one of them who has lain awake at night sick in the stomach about how they were going to pay payroll on Monday, how they were going to pay their land tax and how they were going to pay their income tax. They would not know. We had a contribution from Senator Lambie today. I broke out in a cold sweat there for about five minutes! I thought I had been doing it all wrong all these years, because everything she had to say was absolutely opposite to my instincts in business.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I will tell you this: governments can do one of three things around the economy. They can borrow money, and those on the other side deadset know all about that. They can increase taxes and charges, and they also know about that. Or they can cut services, and they know nothing about that because it is in the environment when the other two are absent that they go and really get bolshie. They increase things. They put things in place and do not put them in the forward estimates. For decades, as long as my adult memory can go back, I know that Labor have come into the federal level and they have done some good things over the years—some terrific things—but what they are no good at is managing the economy. They take a drunken soldier approach.</span>

They think the timber floorboards under their feet at home come from the fairy at the bottom of the garden. They think the cotton coats and the cotton trousers they have on—God forbid!—come from the fairy at the bottom of the garden. They know do not know where that comes from. That comes from a plant where we have disturbed the small biology, and we have got some water from the river and we have washed it. and then we have a header—that dirty, filthy header—pumping out a bit of smoke into the atmosphere.</span>

                    </a>  Yes, including transport companies and graziers. But it is churn. You have only got to go to the figures to see that. They have been around for a long time—nearly 30 years in beef, for a start, where the top end are making about three per cent. Admittedly, in the fullness of time, there is some capital growth in the assets with prudent operators, and that will compensate them in some ways in terms of this small profit margin. But it is about three per cent. I promise you that, by the time these people get through to the end of the year after they have turned over $2 million, $3 million or $4 million, they are lucky to have a taxable income of perhaps $130,000 or $140,000. Do you know how they got that? They got that because mum and dad got up at 4 am, mum and dad did not go to bed until 6 pm or 7 pm and mum and dad did not whinge like some in here did when they had to come and do a fifth day!</span>

But it is through this illiteracy, at important times, as we try and stimulate our economy—we cannot borrow any more money; nobody wants to cut services; we have tested that in this place time and time and time again—that, when there were $6 billion worth of savings to the economy to repair the structural deficit problem, all of you voted against it.</span>

                      <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Senator McKENZIE</span>
                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Victoria</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">16:11</span>):  I rise to speak on the Treasury Laws Amendment (Enterprise Tax Plan) Bill 2016. I am the daughter of a small business owner. I want to congratulate Senator O'Sullivan for so clearly articulating the reality of living with and growing up in a small business here in Australia. Senator McGrath made a contribution about his attempts with his sister in the small business sphere. He has obviously chosen another path, and he is probably best suited to it. But, still, that sense of entrepreneurialism and creativity and the necessity to have a work ethic which is beyond no other are the core ingredients to be successful in small business.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The reality is that every single dollar and every single hour of my own family was reinvested back into the business for it to grow and for us to be able to employ others. We did not have a lot of employees, but those that we did have were paid well and were seen as an extended part of our family. It was for us to purchase not new cars or palatial holiday homes but a new truck or we would put some money away so that dad could actually pay the power bill.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Small businesses back themselves. They are a unique breed of people who like to start their own enterprises. Small business men and women back themselves, and we as a government back them. We have backed them with our enterprise tax plan. It is a 10-year blueprint, a suite of initiatives to back them to grow and develop. Why would we do that? Why would we bother? Why do we want to make it easier for small to medium enterprises in particular to grow and develop? It is because all the research, evidence and collective personal experience in the sector tells us that small businesses will reinvest in themselves—in their ideas, paddocks, stocks, research and knowledge.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Most importantly, for those of us who care about increasing job opportunities, particularly for young people in this country at this point in time in our nation's growth where the mining boom has come off, it is about ensuring that small businesses can invest in their people. It means employing more people. It means giving existing employees more hours. It means training and upskilling existing staff. I believe that is a very good thing, and I cannot believe some of the contributions I have heard over recent days on this particular initiative, which, as Senator O'Sullivan outlined, completely misunderstands small businesses, how they work and what decreasing the corporate tax rate would deliver for them and how they operate, and the flow-on benefits, not just to the small business owners and operators but, importantly, to our communities, to people looking for a job, people wanting to increase their hours.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We need to ensure that all areas of our economy are supercharged to grow and develop going forward. Small businesses are uniquely positioned across a range of industries to do that. That is why not only are we wanting to implement this suite of initiatives, on which I will go into more detail later, but right across the board our government has been focused on signing new free trade agreements, which give small to medium enterprises priority access into key markets across a range of industries, not just agriculture but education, manufacturing, financial services—a whole suite of opportunities that we have been steadily delivering since the day the coalition government came to power. That is paying significant dividends in our local communities and for me as a senator who represents regional Australia in our regional economies and local areas.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We have the new defence plan. <span style="font-style:italic;">(Quorum formed</span><span style="font-style:italic;">) </span>Our defence spending is targeted at advanced manufacturing, and that is not occurring just in South Australia, I would like to inform the Senate. There are some fantastic advanced manufacturers, particularly across regional Victoria, who are very excited about the opportunity to contribute to these significant projects within the Defence portfolio and giving them an additional source of income and indeed development of the technical expertise of their employees.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">On competition policy, long championed by the Nationals and the Liberal Party, we saw Professor Ian Harper undertake a root and branch examination of competition policy in this country as one of the things our government has been delivering for small business as part of our desire to grow jobs across the country and see small business men and women succeed. The competition policy ensures that those firms with market power are unable now to engage in behaviour that harms the competitive process. Businesses large and small should compete and not be unfairly excluded by their rivals. This has been a significant win, and I know it has been incredibly welcomed by the small business sector. We are very proud to have delivered that.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">
                    <span style="font-style:italic;" />The industry codes we have been developing over a long time—the horticulture code, the dairy code: those of us who represent particularly the states of Victoria and Tasmania know just how important the dairy industry is to the economic development of our states. Having an industry code that maps out those relationships between producers and processors is important to ensure that there is equity throughout the system. I know we have also announced issues around the sugar code. I know those in Queensland—and I know Senator O'Sullivan has been working in that particular issue for a very long time; for years. He has only been here for a short time, but it was one of the first issues that he took up and championed. <span style="font-style:italic;">(Quorum formed)</span></span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I think it is a bit rich for those opposite and, particularly the Australian Greens, to, when it suit them, call for us to have evidence-based policy and, when it suits them, to call to make decisions based in science. But they are very quick to run the other way when it does not suit their particular political persuasion. So here we have all the research in. It is unfortunate. Even the current Leader of the Opposition knows that when you reduce company tax rates more people get jobs. It is the evidence from overseas, and I will go into that in a little more detail later. It is the evidence here. It is the economic theory. Everywhere you look, when you cut corporate tax rates small businesses will reinvest in themselves and will employ more people. It is a simple fact. But they turn their back on the evidence because it does not suit their political narrative at the moment. We know that 1.8 million Australians are looking for extra work to boost their take-home pay at the moment. These tax cuts will assist Australian small businesses to assist with that task—to, maybe, pass on additional hours and, maybe, not employ an additional person but, indeed, offer more hours to those existing employees.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">What these tax cuts will be able to do is actually assist in the payment of a significant increase in input costs. I travelled through regional Victoria with the minister for resources recently and spoke to a range of regional small businesses, employing upwards of 60 people in Wangaratta, of 120 people in Wodonga, of close to 300 people in Wahgunyah. To a man and woman, when we spoke about the impact of electricity costs on their business, it is affecting their capacity to grow and develop. It is affecting their capacity to employ more people. When they are telling us their electricity prices are increasing by 30 per cent, you know something is wrong. That is why, with our government backing small business, we have launched an ACCC inquiry to review the electricity market—to ensure that, once again, we are backing small business.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I am really flummoxed, actually, at why those opposite do not understand. They are very happy to bag us out. They want to increase the number of apprentices on work building sites. They want more apprentices, they want more tradies. They are very happy to back that pipeline starting, but what happens when the apprentice graduates and, actually, is a small businessman?</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">
                    <span class="HPS-OfficeInterjecting">The DEPUTY PRESIDENT:</span>  Senator McKenzie, just resume your seat. I am sorry to keep interrupting. I have reminded senators quite a few times today to be in their seats in the chamber. If you wish to have meetings, that is what the lobby is for. I am sorry, Senator McKenzie. Please continue.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">
                    <a href="207825" type="MemberContinuation">
                      <span class="HPS-MemberContinuation">Senator McKENZIE:</span>
                    </a>  It is no good being an apprentice and earning those wages and doing what you have to do as an apprentice if you do not have the hope that one day you will be a small business. <span style="font-style:italic;">(Quorum formed)</span> It is also why we have initiated the beef inquiry with the ACCC et cetera, because we are backing small business to absolutely ensure that they can get on with doing what they need to do—making sure that our markets are transparent. We are backing those who are trying to make decisions—who are, as Senator O'Sullivan said, getting up at the crack of dawn, looking for more hours in the day to build their business; not taking six weeks holiday and not taking four weeks holiday. As the daughter of a small business man, I was lucky to have two two-week holidays as a family in 15 years because Dad could not afford to take time off from the business or be away from the business for that time.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The reality is that we understand what it means to build and grow a small business, and it is important. We live in a global environment. A lot of my colleagues have gone to the lack of international competitiveness when it comes to Australia's corporate tax rate. We have just heard about President Trump deciding to halve the USA's corporate tax rate, which is a significant shift when we look at our own region where our produce is competing, where many of our small to medium enterprises are seeking to open operations and do business. We are significantly below what the average tax take is; even across the OECD we are in the lowest five of those 35 countries. Something has to be done. You cannot maintain this standard living that we enjoy; governments cannot continue to deliver the level of service that we benefit from in this country and not supercharge those small to medium enterprises which are delivering the dollars to allow you to do that.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I really appreciated Senator Hinch, in his earlier commentary, speaking about two businesses that I have visited in regional Victoria—Furphys down in Shepparton and Gippsland Aeronautics down in Sale, which is around 300 kilometres from Melbourne. Gippsland Aeronautics is an aeronautical business employing significant numbers locally, but what I really appreciate about having this small business in a regional community is that it is showcasing the importance of science and technology to young people within the Gippsland region. It is a high-tech job, as this company supplies aeroplanes to markets such as India and, indeed, a maintenance program. They turn over much closer to $50 million than they $2 million, and that is the reality of it. If we want to supercharge these businesses in our local communities, we cannot assume that we need a level of $2 million. It has to be much, much closer to $50 million, and that is all the evidence before us.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">In the Senate Economics Committee's report into this bill, the need for internationally competitive corporate tax settings was raised time and time again: </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">Research demonstrates cutting company tax will drive capital into Australia for new enterprises, jobs and opportunities.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We need that capital investment, and we need to be internationally competitive to get that flowing here. Other issues raised include the need to address falling levels of business investment and that the Enterprise Tax Plan would incentivise that type of investment. The Enterprise Tax Plan was a driver of growth in the economy, employment and wages. The CPA in Australia argued that there was clear evidence that reducing the tax burden on business lifts productivity, increases both their competitiveness and their capacity to expand and encourages job creation.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Why is the Labor Party, the supposed champion of workers, wanting to stop the creation of jobs? In the face of all the evidence, international and local, when we have the CPA saying it and countless experts and economists saying it, why won't you accept the evidence? You used to base policy in evidence. You used to look at the research. It is just a pity you have turned your back on ensuring that businesses can grow and, therefore, employ more Australians. The report went to outlining some of the benefits. Indeed, Australian Small Business and Family Enterprise Ombudsman, Ms Kate Carnell, made quite a good contribution that I would like to enlighten the Senate about. When we looked at expressing support for increasing the tax discount for unincorporated small businesses, Ms Carnell said that this would account for approximately 73 per cent of small businesses, particularly small family businesses, that choose to manage their affairs through various legal structures such as partnerships and trusts.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This is important for us to actually grow and develop. When we look overseas at the evidence, we see that the UK was able to reduce their corporate tax rate from 28 per cent down to 20 per cent over seven years. Oxford University estimated that that provided an additional 11 billion pounds, which was, again, a significant input into that economy. New Zealand, the UK, Canada—now we know the USA is also considering decreasing their corporate tax rate. We need to address this issue.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">As I said, the Labor Party used to look at the evidence and arrive at sometimes different conclusions from those that my side of politics made, but on this they have not. This is a clear case of the Labor Party and the Greens putting raw politics ahead of principle and policy. That is the sad fact of their behaviour when it comes to this bill today. When Bill Shorten was part of government and was tasked with the heavy lifting of ensuring the future job creation for this country occurred, he said:</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">Cutting the company income tax rate increases domestic productivity and domestic investment. More capital means higher productivity and economic growth and leads to more jobs and higher wages.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">If he believed that in 2011, I am not sure we have enough evidence before us to say that something happened between 2011 and 2017 that led him to change his mind. I do not know what that could be other than him becoming opposition leader rather than being the Assistant Treasurer. When he was Minister for Financial Services and Superannuation, he said:</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">Any student of Australian business and economic history since the mid-80s knows that part of Australia's success was derived through the reduction in the company tax rate … We need to be able to make life easier for Australian business, which employs two in every three Australians.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Mr Shorten said that in 2012. I do not think anything has changed, Mr Shorten. I think you were right then. I think you need to back yourself, Mr Shorten. You need to back the research. You know that this is the right thing to do to get the economy into a place where we can deliver real jobs and real opportunities to so many in our community. Again, when he was Assistant Treasurer:</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">The Government's tax reform agenda has a strong focus on ensuring that Australia remains an attractive place to invest.</span>
                </p>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Fantastic! Let's get the capital in. Let's invest. Let's get these jobs going.</span>

It is an absolute farce because, when you have the opportunity to vote on legislation that will make a material and real difference to job creation in this country, you choose to play cheap political games. You choose to play cheap political games instead of backing our small-business community, backing those businesses who are working night and day, with their staff, to grow, develop and contribute. We choose to back them. We choose to back every single one of them.</span>

                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Western Australia</span>—<span class="HPS-MinisterialTitles">Minister for Finance and Deputy Leader of the Government in the Senate</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">16:40</span>):  I would like to thank all senators who have contributed to this very important debate about a more competitive business tax system for Australia, which was designed by the government to boost investment, boost productivity, generate stronger growth and, of course, create more jobs and, over time, increase real wages. This bill represents the most significant reform to Australia's business taxation framework in a generation. It is a visionary piece of legislation that will help set up Australia for the next decades. It will foster much needed investment and wage growth and will allow businesses to create new jobs. It will solidify Australia as a competitive, pro-business, pro-investment destination.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I would like to thank all of the non-government senators who have been good enough to engage constructively and positively with the government in helping us implement as much of our national economic plan and as much of the agenda that we took to the last election as possible. Of course, we understand that we do not have a majority in this chamber in our own right and we understand that we have to work with non-government senators and that we need to persuade a number of non-government senators in order to be able to successfully pass legislation through the Senate.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">In this context and in the context of the government's commitment to pursue a 10-year enterprise tax plan, I would like to personally thank Senators Leyonhjelm and Bernardi who were enthusiastic supporters of lower and more competitive business taxes right from the word go and have indicated to the government that they would be prepared to support the government's enterprise tax plan in full. </span>

                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Next, I would like to thank the senators from One Nation, who have also engaged constructively with the government and have indicated to us that they would be in a position to support enterprise tax cuts for businesses with a turnover of up to $50 million per annum. That, of course, would help us implement the first three years of our enterprise tax plan with a turnover threshold of $10 million scheduled in our plan for 2016-17, $25 million for 2017-18 and $50 million for the next financial year.</span>
                </p>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Senator Hinch has also very constructively engaged with the government. I am sure that Senator Hinch will not mind me saying that he was particularly persuaded by the quality of the businesses in Victoria—in particular, across regional Victoria—that would benefit and the workers in those businesses across Victoria that would benefit from a more competitive business tax rate. Of course, by increasing the threshold over the next few years from a turnover threshold of $10 million to a turnover threshold of $50 million, another 10,000 businesses and another one million workers across Australia will benefit from the reduced corporate tax rate that the government is pursuing through this chamber. The government is very grateful for the work that Senator Hinch has done with the government in that regard. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">

As the Senate would know, the Prime Minister recently met with gas producers to, in the first instance, secure voluntary undertakings to that effect. In the absence of a satisfactory agreement with gas producers by 1 July 2017, the government will protect the public interest by intervening in the gas export markets with the objective of increasing the domestic supply of gas. Further, in the absence of a satisfactory agreement with gas producers, the government will enshrine this arrangement in an ongoing public interest requirement, having regard to, amongst other things, the affordable, reliable, efficient and long-term domestic supply to Australian energy consumers.</span>

The government have agreed, as a result of our discussions with the Nick Xenophon Team, to accelerate and secure delivery of this solar thermal or other large-scale solar project in Port Augusta through a formal call for proposals through the Australian Renewable Energy Agency and the Clean Energy Finance Corporation and by making a Commonwealth concessional loan of up to $110 million available at a three per cent interest rate, which is the bond rate plus one per cent.</span>

There are some relevant proposals that have previously been assessed by the private sector but have not so far been progressed. The government is prepared to help accelerate consideration of this proposal by conducting a national interest and economic cost-benefit analysis as a precursor to a fully-fledged feasibility study. The government's preference would be for a private proponent to develop this project. However, subject to a positive national interest and economic assessment, the government would be prepared to invest in this infrastructure to make it happen. Self-evidently, to strengthen the national interest and economic case for this project, we will need the Northern Territory government to lift its current moratorium on further gas development.</span>

This, of course, delivers in full on the commitments we took to the last election for this term of parliament. It will be, of course, a matter for the Australian people to determine at the next election whether they want to see the coalition continue to implement our plan for jobs and growth, our plan for a stronger economy, our plan to help people across Australia to get ahead by continuing to help businesses across Australia to be the most successful they can be.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The one thing that people on this side of the chamber and all of the crossbench senators who have engaged with us understand is that, for individual Australians to be as successful as possible, for individual Australians to have the best possible opportunity to get ahead, we need the businesses that employ them to have the best possible opportunity to be successful and profitable. Letting businesses keep a little bit more of their money to reinvest in their future success will help them hire more Australians and pay them better wages over time. That is what this reform is all about. I thank all those senators who have joined with the government to help make this happen, to help us implement the first three years of our 10-year plan. I commend the bill to the Senate.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The effect of the government's amendments is that, as I indicated in my summing up speech, instead of applying to all businesses, the company tax cuts will only apply to businesses with a turnover of up to $50 million from the 2018-19 financial year onwards. In 2016-17, it will be $10 million turnover; in 2017-18, it will be $25 million turnover; and, in 2018-19, it will be $50 million turnover. The tax rate will progressively reduce, as per the trajectory in the budget, to 25 per cent. I commend the amendments to the Senate.</span>

We have heard what the minister has said to this chamber. But—after a double sitting week where we have cut payments to families, where we have left poor children out of child care and where we have seen the government stand up for big business over people losing their penalty rates—now the final act of this Senate is to come and agree to tax cuts for businesses up to $50 billion!</span>

At a time when we are getting lectures from those opposite about making ends meet, about tightening the belt and about everyone else having to make sacrifices, we are going to give a big cash-splash to the big end of town.

So, at a time when we have got crossbenchers standing up and supporting the government on the need for fiscal restraint, they are going to wave through this bill that will hit the budget to the cost of at least $19 billion, but with the added cost of whatever the agreement is with the Nick Xenophon Team on the announcements made by the minister today, and I am sure there have been some costings done on that.</span>

To try and ram through an initiative. You kept us here all night. We were here last night. We stayed. We had a filibuster on race hate laws so that you could deliver a tax cut to your business mates. That is what has become of this chamber. I have to say that I think the world of Senator Xenophon. Senator Xenophon is a friend of mine. </span>

A few things the government had to do anyway to address the issues in South Australia? That the government has come in here with a cash-splash payment shows that it is literally buying votes now. That is what it is. In the trade union movement, there is a thing called a 'sign-on bonus'. What you get for workers is a sign-on bonus. Was this a sign-on bonus deal?

You are a government who has lost your agenda. You are a government who has lost your focus. You are a government who has spent a week hurting young families and trying to water down our race laws, and now you are doing tax deals for your business mates. That is what has become of your government. And today, if there was any shred of fiscal responsibility on that side of the chamber—which you, Senator Cormann, pride yourself on—all of that is now out the door, because this will be the day when you spend up to $20 billion of taxpayers' funds on a dirty deal done in the corridors of parliament to simply try and upstage the Leader of the Government in the Senate. </span>

We have heard Senator Gallagher talk about $19 billion. Could Senator Cormann confirm to the chamber what the costs will be to the budget?

                    </a>  Don't you worry, Senator: I am going to get to the bottom-line impact. But it is very important for everyone here to understand that this is not a piece of legislation that spends money. This is a piece of legislation that lets certain businesses keep more of their own money so that they can invest it in their future success, be more profitable in the future, so they can hire more Australians, so they can pay them better wages over time. This is what this is about. This is about letting businesses have more of their own money, which will boost investment, boost productivity and give people across Australia a better chance to get ahead.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Of course there is a bottom-line impact, and that has been built into our budget, and I am quite happy to answer the question by Senator Whish-Wilson. It has been built into the budget, and, as Senator Whish-Wilson knows, the 2016-17 budget—and that was confirmed in our half-yearly budget update in December—is projected to return to surplus in 2020-21. And even if the Senate had passed and had legislated the company tax cut in full, the budget was projected to be in surplus from 2020-21 onwards over the medium term, which means that the effect of the company tax cut was fully funded in our budget bottom line, and we are still in surplus after taking into account the effect of our tax cut.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Now, you asked me what the specific cost of this measure as amended is to the budget bottom line. The cost over the forward estimates is about $5.2 billion, and the cost over the medium term to 2026-27 is about $24 billion. Compared with what was of course on the table before, the bottom-line impact that is not occurring as a result of this amendment is about $25.8 billion over the medium term.</span>

The first point I would make is that of course much of what the government discussed with the Nick Xenophon Team focused on policies, the policies to bring down the cost of electricity, to increase energy reliability and to do so in a way that still ensures that we can meet our emissions reduction targets and commitments that we made in the context of the Paris Agreement. A lot of what we have agreed focuses on policies to drive more affordable and more reliable energy supplies and of course to do so in as emissions efficient a way as possible.</span>

In terms of the measures that have a specific budget implication, I have spelled out our commitment to accelerate and secure delivery of the solar thermal project in Port Augusta through a formal call for proposals through the Australian Renewable Energy Agency and the Clean Energy Finance Corporation. I have already indicated to the chamber that the government is prepared to make available a Commonwealth concessional loan of up to $110 million at a three per cent interest rate, which is the bond rate plus one per cent. The other measure that has a cost attached to it is the one-off energy assistance payment. I stress that it is a one-off energy assistance payment. The cost of that, I am advised, is about $260 million.</span>

There must be an end point in terms of ensuring security of supply and lower prices. The process that has been agreed to is a process, but it will have an end date, because by 1 July 2018 there must be changes to the National Electricity Market rules to bring everything to a head in order to ensure that there are lower prices for our electricity and security of supply. These are fundamental issues. If you talk to businesses around the country today, they are hurting because of increases in energy prices. They are also hurting because we have not had a coherent gas policy in this country in terms of getting more gas here locally, having a public interest test and ensuring that we are not seeing gas exported overseas and so there can be intervention if there is inaction by gas companies. There is a real concern about a dominance and concentration of market power.</span>

That is something that needs to be looked at, but in terms of the policies it will mean more local, domestic gas. It will mean a reduction of prices for consumers. It will mean that by 1 July 2018, an end date, there will be some fundamental changes to the National Electricity Market rules so that we can actually tackle these issues of security of supply and listen to and take heed of the Climate Change Authority and the Australian Energy Market Commission. They are the experts that deal with these issues.</span>

Their maximum turnover is $50 million. You have Credit Union SA, which is under the $50 million. There is Barossa Fine Foods, a smallgoods maker located in Adelaide. There is Cleanseas tuna, a commercial producer of kingfish. There is Golden North Ice Cream, between $10 million and $50 million, which is a key employer in the country town of Laura in the mid-north. There is Robern Menz, a confectionery manufacturer, which is between $10 million and $50 million. There are Beerenberg farm and B.-d. Farm Paris Creek. These are not multinationals; these are small and medium enterprises, by and large family businesses, that can actually grow in respect of this. We are not talking about the banks, Google or Facebook. We are talking about, by and large, family businesses that need this assistance.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We also will have certainty with the National Electricity Market rules with these changes. Right now there is an investment strike in this country. People are not prepared to invest in power, because of the uncertainty of policy. We now have a clear pathway with an end date of 1 July 2018 in relation to changes to those rules. The first of July 2018 is when those significant changes to the NEM rules will be in place.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We also have certainty for the solar thermal project in Port Augusta, something the government has spoken about previously. The minister may want to comment on this, but we will now have a commitment for this project to go ahead. The solar thermal plant—a demonstration plant—effectively provides baseload power or, at the very least, intermediate and peaking power. It will be a world-class demonstration in South Australia that will create a thousand jobs in its construction phase. These are all important issues and will show the rest of Australia that you can build baseload renewables, which are fundamental to dealing with issues of inertia and security of supply.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">In terms of that one-off payment: things are tough for those pensioners and for those on parenting payments, and that one-off payment is important to getting people through before we get those significant changes in the National Electricity Market.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This is good for consumers. It will lower prices and deliver security of supply with that start date of the new rules on 1 July 2018.</span>

                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Western Australia</span>—<span class="HPS-MinisterialTitles">Minister for Finance and Deputy Leader of the Government in the Senate</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">17:27</span>):  The first point I would make is that everything we have agreed with the Nick Xenophon Team is something that the government fully stands behind and is very comfortable with because it fits with our overall policy objective, which is to improve energy affordability, to improve energy reliability and to do so in a way that helps us still meet our emissions reduction targets as agreed in Paris. So there was actually right from the start, as we engaged with the Nick Xenophon Team, a strong consensus on the objective.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We did engage in particular with the Nick Xenophon Team around the proposition of the power affordability and reliability policy. Specifically, we have agreed at the Nick Xenophon Team's request to direct AEMC and the Climate Change Authority over the next fortnight to jointly produce a report that provides advice with regard to a policy or policies to enhance power systems security and to reduce energy prices. This body of work will now feed into and enhance the Finkel review and ultimately the decisions that will have to be made around changes to the rules in the National Electricity Market. We were very pleased to engage with the Nick Xenophon Team in that regard.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The proposed approach in relation to gas retention leases is something that we have agreed to at the Nick Xenophon Team's request. Obviously the objective here is to advance and pursue the introduction of a nationally consistent, stricter use-it-or-lose-it test in the context of gas retention leases in order to help address the barriers to the commercial development of gas fields and ultimately to enhance the supply of gas, which over time, of course, would be expected to reduce energy prices.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">There are a range of other changes that I have read out. I am not going to bore the chamber by reading through the comprehensive list of measures again. The Productivity Commission inquiry is something that we specifically agreed to. The price transparency measures are something that, as I have indicated to the Nick Xenophon Team, the government was already working towards. This now formalises that decision. As Senator Xenophon indicated, the solar thermal plant in Port Augusta is something that, in the lead-up to the last election, we committed ourselves to, but this now locks in a process to ensure it happens more quickly. We have, of course, put specific money on the table in the form of a concessional loan.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">In relation to the work with the gas pipelines that Senator Xenophon has just talked about, obviously, we have been aware of the private sector proposal that has been assessed in the past, and we are very pleased to commit ourselves to a national interest and economic assessment and a fully-fledged feasibility study to properly assess and explore whether this project could help increase supply and reduce the cost of energy across the national electricity market. That is what we are working on. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The one-off energy assistance payment: I do not think Senator Xenophon will mind me saying that I was not all that enthusiastic about that particular proposal. But, in order to facilitate the passage of this very important reform, the government has agreed to accept this particular request. I do not really know what else I can add, as I think I have now gone several times through all of the features of the consensus that we have reached with the Nick Xenophon Team.</span>

This is a policy that we took to the last election; it is a policy that is reflected in the budget. Today we are legislating the first three years of what is a 10-year enterprise tax plan. If you look at the 2016-17 budget papers you will see in there that the government has made a very firm and fully funded commitment to a 10-year enterprise tax plan and, indeed, to bring down the corporate tax rate for all businesses to 25 per cent over a 10-year period.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Again, I do not want to hold up the chamber for much longer either, but, as I have previously indicated in this chamber, getting down to 25 per cent over a 10-year period will only, in 10 years time, get us into the middle of the road of business tax rates around the world. It will not put us in the lead, but at least it will remove us from the bottom of the list, where we are currently hovering. Right now Australia is becoming increasingly uncompetitive when it comes to attracting investment, and we have to ensure that we make our company tax rates more competitive again. But, of course, the government is fully committed to all of the policies that are reflected in our budget.</span>

I simply want to know which area of the poor you are going to take that money off to give to the other area of the poor that you are actually filling in to give the other $75 to. This is a pattern of behaviour. Surely you must have worked that out—you are certainly not going to hit the same area to take from this hand to give to the other. But, then again, it is a pattern of behaviour. Surely you must have decided where you can take that money from so you do not affect that lower income group again to give to this side of the lower income group.</span>

All of the money that is raised by the GST is distributed to the states—100 per cent. The next point I would make is that it is this government that has actually stopped the drop in Western Australia's share of the GST by making a unilateral, one-off payment from the federal budget—not taking money out of the GST, but from the federal budget—of $500 million in 2015-16 and about $500 million in 2016-17 to support important infrastructure projects in Western Australia. The effect of that has been to effectively stop the drop in Western Australia's share of the GST at the 2014-15 level.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I find it very interesting that Senator Sterle keeps jumping up in relation to this issue here in the chamber. But if he were really serious he would convince his leader, Mr Shorten, to commit to a higher share of the GST payments under a Shorten-led Labor government—unless you are prepared to put your money where your mouth is, unless you, Senator Sterle, can convince your leader to take money away from South Australia. I see Senator Gallacher over there and he would be quite happy, I guess, for Mr shorten to say, 'We are going to take money away from South Australia and from Tasmania,'—I see Senator Lambie over there—and give it to Western Australia. If you can convince Mr Shorten of that, let's have another conversation.</span>

Today is another demonstration of the fact that this is another day of delivery by the Turnbull government. We are very grateful for the supportive and constructive approach that the crossbench senators have taken in working with the government in the pursuit of the national interest. Pauline Hanson's One Nation party, the Nick Xenophon Team, Senator Leyonhjelm, Senator Bernardi and Senator Hinch all have worked constructively with the government in the pursuit of the national interest. Let me tell you that with the commitments the government makes we clearly have a demonstrated track record of delivery on those commitments. Sometimes the Senate slows us down. Sometimes we would like to be able to implement our plans faster. We are always very enthusiastic to get cracking and get things delivered much faster, but we respect the fact that we are accountable to the parliament, including to the Senate.</span>

What it means is that what is on the table is the pursuit of a power affordability and reliability policy, as I have clearly indicated to the chamber. I will remind the chamber of what the government has agreed to do. The government has agreed to direct AEMC and the Climate Change Authority, over the next fortnight, to jointly produce a report that provides advice with regard to a policy or policies to enhance power system security and to reduce energy prices, consistent with achieving our emissions reduction targets in the Paris agreement.</span>

                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I pause here to say that I am sure these are objectives shared by all senators in this chamber. I believe that all of us in this chamber would share the objective that is enshrined in that particular proposition. And further, as I indicated earlier, the report will be informed by independent modelling which will be jointly commissioned by the AEMC and the Climate Change Authority and be factored into the work undertaken by Chief Scientist Finkel on behalf of COAG. The report will be presented to government by 1 June 2017, it will be made public by 15 June 2017 and it will be tabled in parliament on the next available sitting date and be taken into account by the government as it acts on the Finkel review recommendations to approve the affordability and reliability of energy supplies. Finally, and this is a very important point, the government's commitment is that, in light of the reports and reviews that I have just read you through, to pursue the implementation of a power affordability and reliability policy—again, I am sure everybody in this chamber would support a power affordability and reliability policy—which can be generated to put downward pressure on electricity prices and enhance energy reliability through relevant changes to the national electricity market rules. As Senator Xenophon has also indicated, the government has made a commitment that the implementation of such a policy will begin at the earliest possible opportunity and no later than 1 July 2018.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">As flagged in my second reading speech to the Senate, the amendments that have been circulated in my name match Labor's very sensible and fiscally responsible election commitments—and I will be very brief, considering the hour. Labor's amendments are targeted. They are affordable. They would benefit three million small businesses. The amendments include: reducing the company tax rate to 27.5 per cent for businesses with a turnover of less than $2 million, the threshold that remains consistent with the ATO's definition of a small business; increasing the unincorporated small business tax discount from five per cent to eight per cent for businesses with a turnover of less than $2 million; and not proceeding with the increase to the small-business-entity threshold. Our position, costed by the Parliamentary Budget Office, would save $4.4 billion over the forward estimates and $50 billion over the medium term, and I commend the amendments to the Senate.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Obviously, there is plenty of cash around in the budget these days. The government expects that all these great big tax cuts will give back dividends, so I am simply asking on behalf of one of the most vulnerable sectors in business, which is small businesses with a medium turnover of up to $10 million, that the government cut their tax rate from 28.5 per cent to 23.5 per cent over a five-year period. That is one per cent per year. That is what these amendments mean, and that is what I am asking for. I commend the amendments to the Senate. </span>

In your opening statement, you went into a level of detail about your negotiations with the Xenophon team. I understand that when you do these things in dark corridors, as Senator Dastyari mentioned, it is always hard to bring the precise details with you. But I am sure you did your best to outline what the three South Australian Xenophon team members wanted to deliver for their home state. But, in that address, I did not actually hear you go into any detail about what the Pauline Hanson One Nation team extracted for their votes. I am particularly interested in what the two Queensland senators were able to extract as part of their deal to support this package. </span>

That is a matter of public record. Senator Hanson, as leader of Pauline Hanson's One Nation party, has been on the public record for some time now that her party supports business tax cuts for businesses with a turnover of up to $50 million. But I am not surprised that Senator Chisholm has not noticed that. He must have been so focused on negotiating a preference deal for the next state election that he did not pay attention to what was actually happening in the community he is meant to represent.</span>

                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Queensland</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">18:15</span>):  I would like to make a comment in regard to that. Let me put it on the record that One Nation did not do any 'dirty deals'. That might be your way of operating in this chamber, but no deals have been done. It is about talking common sense about policies. That is where we are coming from. It is on the record: no dirty deals. You would like to think so—but no. The sugar industry was putting a case forward long before this was actually spoken about. I was working with the canegrowers at the end of last year to get a code of conduct done. So I was pleased to see that the National Party and the Liberal Party could see the sense in helping the cane growers of North Queensland—your constituents, I might say. These are Senator Chisholm's constituents and he never took any interest in trying to represent them. So he can answer them at the ballot box at the next election. The fact is that no deals have been done—nothing whatsoever—and this was a good outcome for small businesses in Australia. In the last year, we have seen 260,000 small businesses exit the scene. That is a problem that is happening in Australia. So I think this is a good outcome for the government.</span>
