<para>—I would like to advise senators that Mr Brien Hallett has been appointed as the new Usher of the Black Rod. Brien has come to the Department of the Senate from Government House, where he held the position of Deputy Official Secretary. I have no doubt that Brien will live up to the high standard set by previous holders of this important position. I am sure all senators will join me in welcoming Brien and wishing him all the best in his new role.</para>

<para>Senators will also note that a digital readout has been added to the debate timing clocks in the chamber. This is a trial to see whether this facility assists senators in managing their contributions in this place.

<para>The Department of Parliamentary Services have advised that one of the three main air-conditioning units is not currently operating. Consequently, senators and staff may notice an increase in the air temperature until the system is repaired. DPS are working to repair the fault and it is expected that the unit will be returned to service later on Wednesday.</para>
<para>I also advise senators that the Black Rod’s office has arranged for some artefacts, including the old Presidential wig, gown and lace, to be handed over to Old Parliament House on long-term loan for use in their collection and displays—without the President attached!</para>

<para>—I suppose I am pleased to be speaking on the <inline ref="R3051">Tax Laws Amendment (Political Contributions and Gifts) Bill 2008</inline> today, and there are a number of matters that I would like to go through. The first thing I would like to do is to put to bed, once and for all, the notion that this effectively resubmitted bill has anything to do with campaign finance reform. It should have, but it does not, and I will elaborate on that now. This actually had its origins in 2004 at the ALP national conference when it was a platform to do away with tax deductibility for donations. It lapsed for some reason at that stage. It then came back into being some time later, on 2 March 2007, when it formed part of Labor’s $3 billion savings plan. In 2004 at the national conference—you may well have been there, Mr Acting Deputy President Marshall—there was no mention, on my understanding, about this being part of campaign finance reform. There were no figures done in relation to revenue savings; there was no mention of campaign finance reform. Then we fast-forward to March 2007, when it reared its head under the banner of what was called Labor’s $3 billion savings plan. Again, there was not one word about this being premised on the back of campaign finance reform.</para>
</talk.start>
<para>So in 2004 there was no reference to campaign finance reform. In 2007 there was no mention of campaign finance reform under the $3 billion so-called savings plan. If we fast-forward to the second reading speech of the Assistant Treasurer, Mr Bowen, we see no word about this being premised on the back of campaign finance reform. I am sure honourable senators would be interested to know what Mr Bowen actually said when talking about this bill, acknowledging that it is not about campaign finance reform. Had it been about that, one would think he would have made some mention of it. He said in his second reading speech:</para>
<quote>
<para>I strongly urge the opposition to reconsider their approach to this measure which forms part of the government’s response to inflationary pressures in the economy and our savings plan. This measure and other savings measures are an important component of our effort to put downward pressure on inflation and interest rates.</para>
</quote>
<para class="block">There was not a word about campaign finance reform. Of course, that was when the inflation genie was apparently out of the bottle. That was at the time when the Australian Labor Party were still running the cheap political stunt about inflation, knowing full well—or they should have known full well—that the inflation genie was well and truly in the bottle. Their goading of the Reserve Bank to put up interest rates again after February of last year has in no small part contributed to the situation we are in at the moment. Mr Bowen knew the inflation genie was well and truly in the bottle at that stage. But I will get back to the point: there was no mention at all of campaign finance reform—no mention at all.</para>
<para>I hope some in the gallery—all of whom I have enormous admiration for, as they all well know—will actually see this for the cheap stunt that it is. It is a cheap stunt. As my colleague in the other place Mr Morrison said in his speech on this matter, this is only, if you like, to reinforce an advantage. That is how the Australian Labor Party see this matter. I am not going to go in great depth into the minority report of the Joint Standing Committee on Electoral Matters on the first incarnation of this bill, because my colleagues Senator Birmingham and Senator Ryan will be doing that, but I will go back to what Mr Morrison said in the other place. He said:</para>
<quote>
<para class="block">… it was all about trying to entrench an advantage.</para>
</quote>
<para class="block">And I want to refer to one or two matters in that report.</para>
<para>I pose this question to the chamber and to those listening: how is it that an Australian who wants to participate in the Australian political process by making a donation to a political party or an Independent will under this bill no longer be able to get a tax deduction for that but if one of those opposite in the Australian Labor Party or Australian Labor Party members in the other place want to provide a donation to the Australian Labor Party to entrench their re-nomination they are able to get a tax deduction for that? How is it that an ordinary Australian who wants to participate in the political process is unable to do so as a result of this bill that abolishes tax deductibility but those sitting opposite are able to provide their own political party with as much money as is required to make sure they get re-endorsed and are able to get a deduction for that? How can that possibly be equitable? I will be interested to hear from the parliamentary secretary what the explanation is for that.</para>
<para>I want to turn now to the joint standing committee inquiry. This is as much for the benefit of Senator Bob Brown. The coalition and Senator Brown wanted the inquiry into this bill’s initial incarnation deferred because Senator Brown and the coalition members viewed this as being part of campaign finance reform and thought it should not be treated in isolation. On the casting vote of the ALP chairman that very strong, realistic and sound view was defeated. The minority report states:</para>
<quote>
<para class="block">In fact two thirds of the submissions received by the Inquiry either opposed the removal of tax deductibility or required such changes to be counterbalanced by other measures. In evidence before the Committee this position was well summarised by Associate Professor Graeme Orr from the Democratic Audit of Australia who said:</para>
<para class="block">… it is very premature to do away with a form of encouraging small scale donating at the same time as seriously considering, in a few months time, the banning of large corporate and organisational donations. That is going to lead to serious questions as to where parties get the money from and deductibility, or matching funds, is something that needs to be kept in the mix.</para>
</quote>
<para class="block">In other words, you cannot treat these measures in isolation.</para>
<para>There is a green paper process that most honourable senators would be aware of. Our very strong view is that we should do this properly. The coalition emphatically endorses campaign finance reform taking place. It is long overdue. It is worth reflecting that we actually started this process in early March last year when a reference went from this Senate to the Joint Standing Committee on Electoral Matters. It was a very detailed reference with 10 points, I think from recollection. We said that every single aspect of this debate needed to be put on the table. It was supported by the opposition, the Greens, the then Democrats and Family First. Which political party refused to send off a comprehensive reform proposal to the Joint Standing Committee on Electoral Matters? The Australian Labor Party—the same party that are now alleging that this bill is part of campaign finance reform when clearly they have done and said nothing which would indicate that. As I said, it is; but if you look at what they have said and done, there is no indication of that at all.</para>
<para>The most interesting aspect of the figures of those who had donated to all political parties in the 2007-08 year in the announcement yesterday by the AEC—and I released some figures in relation to this yesterday—was the massive contribution of the union movement to Labor Party coffers. I want to go through those figures because they are breathtaking. Unions donated directly $9.2 million and $26.8 million in direct campaign finance. The interesting part about that is that those funds were, in the main, raised by union subscriptions and passed on to the Australian Labor Party. When those funds were donated, when they were given to their respective unions as subscriptions, they were tax deductible in the hand of the union member who made them. So they have gone via subscriptions, which are tax deductible to those individuals, through to the Australian Labor Party. But if someone sitting in the gallery today who did not pay a union subscription that went through the Australian Labor Party just wanted to make a straight donation to the Australian Labor Party, the Liberal Party of Australia, the Nationals, Family First, the Greens or Senator Xenophon they would not get a tax deduction. So you have got the tax deduction here siphoned through the union movement into the ALP. This argument about equity which we constantly hear from those on the other side is completely and utterly farcical.</para>
<para>I will briefly go through some of these figures. The Shop, Distributive and Allied Employees Association donated $1.5 million; CFMEU, $1.3 million; Communications, Electrical and Plumbing Union, $1 million; Liquor, Hospitality and Miscellaneous Workers Union, $765,000; Electrical Trades Union, $674,000—and it goes on and on. The Australian Workers Union, the Health Services Union, the Transport Workers Union, the ASU and the National Union of Workers are also listed. The Australian Labor Party is utterly beholden to the union movement. As I said yesterday, whoever pays the piper still calls the tune. There are some 35 million reasons why the Australian Labor Party is totally beholden to the trade union movement. When it says jump, this government will jump. We have started to see it already—and hang on for the ride because we have only just seen the start of it.</para>
<para>The other interesting aspect of this deal is that we believe—and I will repeat it ad nauseam—it should be part of comprehensive campaign finance reform and not cherry-picked for cheap political purposes. It should be part of real reform. The question I want to ask today is: what in this bill would stop another Wollongong sex and bribery scandal? How does this bill address the nefarious and appalling behaviour of ALP members in New South Wales, not just in Wollongong, involved in that fundraising? The clear answer to that is that it does not at all. This bill does not address the fundamental issues of comprehensive campaign finance reform. It is long overdue. As I said before, we started this process, we support the green paper process, but if the government is serious about this it will pull this bill—clearly that is too late—and make it part of the process. But the government refuses to acknowledge that it is part of campaign finance reform. Minister Bowen did not mention it, the $3 billion Labor savings plan did not mention it and the 2004 national conference policy platform did not mention it, but it is interesting that in 2004 the ALP actually realised that it had a great opportunity to entrench an advantage. It is very interesting to see who supported the current levels of tax deductibility back in 1996 in a majority report of the Joint Standing Committee on Electoral Matters. Its membership included Senator Stephen Conroy as deputy chair, now a cabinet minister, Mr Robert McClelland MP, now Attorney-General, and Mr Laurie Ferguson MP, now a parliamentary secretary—the utter hypocrisy of those opposite.</para>
<para>Someone told you it was a great idea to entrench an advantage, and that is why you are trying to disenfranchise ordinary Australians from participating in the political process by ensuring that their contributions are not tax-deductible, but others, via the union movement and elsewhere, are able to obtain a tax advantage. Those who want to re-elect the ALP can put as much as they want into the Labor Party. It is deductible for them but no-one else.</para>
<para>The reality is that the Australian community is expecting us to act in relation to this matter. I put on the public record again that the coalition is determined to participate in the overhaul of campaign financing, but we are not prepared to sit back and let the Australian Labor Party cherry-pick aspects of what should be comprehensive campaign finance reform for their own cheap political purposes. I hope the Greens will stick to their guns in relation to this matter and insist that it be part of a comprehensive campaign finance reform. I hope that Senator Xenophon and Senator Fielding will also defeat this bill today to ensure that we put some pressure on the government to make all these issues part of this overdue reform.</para>

<para>—This is a time when all Australians are tightening their belts. Politicians should share the burden and demonstrate to the public that sometimes turkeys do vote for Christmas. The <inline ref="R3051">Tax Laws Amendment (Political Contributions and Gifts) Bill 2008</inline> is a piece of legislation to stop tax deductions for people and organisations that pay membership fees or make donations to political parties and politicians. Two and a half years ago Family First moved an amendment in the Senate to abolish tax deductibility status for political parties. The then government increased the tax deductibility amount from $100 to $1,500, which was just a rort. Family First argued that political parties were not charities; they are self-interested organisations pushing their own agendas. Community groups and lobby groups that push political agendas do not and should not have tax deductibility status, and neither should political parties.</para>
</talk.start>
<para>While Family First agrees with the thrust of the bill, Family First wants to move an amendment to get rid of yet another rort where the major political parties are clawing back more and more funding for their excessive election campaigns. Public funding of federal election campaigns began for a legitimate reason: to provide for a reimbursement of legitimate campaign expenses, and people would say that is fair enough. The key word here, of course, is ‘legitimate’. But since this legislation was introduced in 1984 it has been rife with rorting—rife to the degree that public funding of federal election campaigns has skyrocketed more than 55 per cent over the last four elections. In real terms that means that public funding for the major political parties has spiralled. It was $28 million—excessive enough—but it has jumped to an obscene $43 million. That is $43 million of hard earned taxes paid by ordinary Australians that is spent by political parties to brag about themselves—to brag about what they have done and what they are going to do.</para>
<para>Times are enormously tough for so many in Australia, and our leaders are telling us to expect tough times to continue. So how can political parties justify taking that money given to them by hardworking Australians and then spending that money telling those same Australians how fantastic their political parties are? If political parties want to spend huge amounts on election campaigns, they can dig into their own pockets and get their hands out of the public purse. Australian families should not be expected to fund excessive spending by the major political parties.</para>
<para>We are all sick and tired of being bombarded every election with campaign mail and political TV ads every night, especially when we are paying for it. Family First will be moving an amendment to cap the amount that each major political party can claim from the public to fund their election campaigns to a maximum of $10 million. Ten million dollars for each major political party in each election is more than enough. That is a saving to taxpayers of more than $20 million each election. We must ask ourselves: do the public want their hard earned money spent on political junk mail when it could provide real services? Think about it. That is $20 million that could provide 57 dedicated breast cancer nurses. That $20 million that is saved could be used to invest in teachers. That is $20 million that could be used to help the poor and disadvantaged in our community, who are already struggling to survive.</para>
<para>I know what ordinary hardworking Australian families would choose. If we get it wrong today the public will remember how we gave priority to our own needs instead of the community’s needs, especially when times are so tough. Ten million dollars is more than enough money for any political party to spend on junk mail. Let’s use the rest for something much more important.</para>

</talker>
<para>—I rise in support of the <inline ref="R3051">Tax Laws Amendment (Political Contributions and Gifts) Bill 2008</inline>. As we all know, the measures in this bill were previously contained in the <inline ref="R2915">Tax Laws Amendment (2008 Measures No. 1) Bill 2008</inline>. That bill was not supported by those opposite when it was introduced in the Senate in June last year and, as we are all well aware, the bill was sent off to the Joint Standing Committee on Electoral Matters for investigation and review. The committee is due to report to the Senate in June this year, a full 12 months after having received the reference.</para>
</talk.start>
<para>Why has it taken so long? One has to posit the argument that those opposite are being deliberately obstructive in reviewing that bill. After all, it was relatively straightforward and by no means could be regarded as a complex, complicated or detailed piece of legislation. I find it absolutely extraordinary that those opposite could not, and refuse to, get their heads around the content of a relatively simple bill in a short period of time.</para>
<para>But maybe that is not the point of the debate. The purpose of the Tax Laws Amendment (Political Contributions and Gifts) Bill 2008, along with that of its predecessor, is to remove tax deductibility from contributions and gifts to political parties. It will also remove tax deductibility from donations to Independent candidates and members. The bill has its genesis in the actions and behaviour of the previous government in 2006. At that time, the previous government took a fairly innocuous tax deduction for membership fees of political parties and turned it into a giant, growing tax loophole. Because of that legislation in 2006, a tax deduction of up to $1,500 can now be claimed for contributions and gifts to politicians in each and every year. It was then and remains now a significant increase on the previous maximum deduction of $100 up to $1,500.</para>
<para>But the previous government went much further. They extended, and this is the critical point, tax deductions by individuals to include corporations. The result is that an individual donation, together with a donation through a family business, will attract a tax deduction of up to $3,000. Today, because of that amendment moved in 2006, we have taxpayer subsidies of around $10 million per annum, and growing. Those subsidies are available to businesses and individuals who donate to political parties. But wait, there’s more! At the same time the previous government also increased reporting requirements for political donations, from $1,500 to $10,000. The disclosure threshold of $10,000 was, of course, indexed to the CPI, which was somewhat surprising given that the Medicare surcharge threshold is not indexed. But that is another debate—what the government achieved was a tax trap in that area for working families. Coalition donors are obviously in need of extra protection against inflation!</para>
<para>What was the rationale behind the 2006 changes introduced by the previous government? What value did those changes add to the transparency and accountability of our candidates for, and members of, public office? The answer to that is probably zero, but at best not much at all in terms of transparency, accountability and responsibility. As a device to encourage greater participation by individuals in the political process, it has little or no merit. Certainly corporations, legal entities created by statute, do not have any role in the political process and therefore do not need incentives. So the real question is: why are taxpayers funding donations made by individuals and companies to candidates and members of parliament? Clearly tax deductibility for not-for-profit and charitable organisations is completely logical and completely understandable. There is a sound public purpose behind assisting those organisations to assist themselves and assist the community. Any device that encourages philanthropic donation is worthy of serious review and consideration. Donations made to members of our community and organisations who work tirelessly day in, day out to support those most in need are worthy of support.</para>
<para>Tax deductibility for the cost of doing business is also logical and understandable. But as political parties and candidates for office are neither of the above it begs the question: why extend the concession into a rort for corporations? Why are taxpayers required to support and fund these deductions? Those opposite cannot seriously argue that a donation to a political party is a cost of doing business; candidates for public office are hardly charitable cases. The electorate has a right to expect that contributions to political parties are not treated by the Australian Taxation Office as a cost of doing business or a work related expense. It simply sends the wrong message. It degrades the electorate’s trust in the integrity of our system of government.</para>
<para>As I said, the bill was referred to the Joint Standing Committee on Electoral Matters. The majority recommendation from the committee was that the bill be passed unamended. Unsurprisingly, the architects of the tax loophole did not support the change at that time. Their minority report proposed that the measures be deferred and assessed as part of the committee’s review of campaign finance as if tax deductibility for corporations were a subset of campaign finance. Further deliberations by the committee will not cover up this rort and make a silk purse out of a sow’s ear. Each and every member of this chamber and of the House of Representatives has a responsibility to those who elect them. They have entrusted us with upholding the traditions of our system of government and governance. We have an obligation to ensure that higher standards apply in the funding, spending and disclosure of election contributions. The 2006 rules governing tax deductibility and disclosure bring no credit to our system. They should be scrapped. They should be removed, and that should be done forthwith.</para>
<para>The bill before the chamber today represents a step in the electoral reform promised by the government openly and publicly in the lead-up to the last election. Our government is committed to, firstly, reducing the disclosure threshold for donors from $10,000 to a flat rate of $1,000 and, secondly, to ensuring donations made to different branches of a political party are treated as donations to the same party. A donation to the West Australian branch of the Labor Party, for example, is no different to a donation to the Labor Party in Queensland or New South Wales. They are all part of the same overall national organisation. Thirdly, the government is committed to reducing time frames for lodgement of disclosure returns by political parties to six months, so that released public information is up to date and cogent and discloses to the public the detail of contributions and donations made. Fourthly, the government is committed to making it unlawful for registered political parties, candidates and members of a Senate group to accept overseas donations. Finally, the government is committed to tying public funding for elections to genuine election expenditure. Each of the above five points will ensure that there is transparency and accountability in our electoral system and in the tax rules and disclosure regime that applies to same. They will start the process of rebuilding trust between public officials and the electorate.</para>
<para>In the few moments remaining to me I want to make some comment on an example of a worst-case scenario. It is to be found in the contemporary home of democracy, the United States of America. I would like to talk about the pervasive influence of political action committees, or PACs, as they are commonly known. Essentially PACs in the United States are action committees created and designed for making financial contributions to politicians. There are three types of PACs in that country. The first group are those connected with corporations and labour groups. An example would be Microsoft or a trade union entity. The second group are non-connected or ideological committees such as the National Rifle Association. More important are the third group, known as leadership committees. Leadership committees are formed by politicians to help fund candidates. Funding of these PACs may be made through foundations which can offer tax deductibility on donations. PACs raise and spend money to elect candidates to public office.</para>
<para>There is a limit to how much can be donated by a PAC to an individual. There is a limit to how much can be contributed by a PAC to a candidate’s committee. However, there is no limit on how much a PAC can spend on advertising in support of their particular preferred candidate. There is also no limit on how much can be spent on promoting their particular agenda. There is no limit on how much they can spend on attacking and denigrating an opponent of their candidate. Whilst some members of congress, it must be said, make a point of not accepting any PAC money, they are few and far between.</para>
<para>A case in point is the recent presidential and congressional elections in the United States. The cost of two years of campaigning can be financially debilitating. I understand from public documentation that there is little change left over from $5 million or $10 million in Senate elections. Federal Election Commission data in November 2008, available on the Centre for Responsive Politics website, shows the cost of Senate, house and presidential election campaigns. It shows that in November last year PAC contributions to house candidates were around $287 million, from a total of $884 million raised to that date; PAC contributions to Senate candidates were around $74 million, from a total of $374 million raised to that date; and PAC contributions to presidential candidates were of a similar order of magnitude.</para>
<para>The point I am coming to, the point I wish to make in this debate, is that large amounts of money directed to particular interests can overwhelm the political process. As a result of the PAC system in the United States there is now a new class of lobbyists and apparatchiks active in Washington and other centres of influence in that country. This new class of individuals has immense influence on public policy and public officials. It has become a growth industry, with thousands and thousands of committees now operating legally and under the law in the United States.</para>
<para>PACs, of course, are required to identify their sponsors. However, I note in passing that many choose not to. The law has not apparently been enforced, and the Centre for Responsive Politics is asking for help to identify ‘mystery’ PACs. So, even with all the regulations governing public disclosure of contributions, spending and sponsorship, it is still possible to conceal from the electorate how vast sums of money are used to affect political outcomes. We do not have PACs in Australia, and that is a very useful thing. But we need to be vigilant in seeking to eliminate the influence of money and donations in our political system.</para>
<para>Those opposite have demonstrated time and time again their commitment to hiding political donors in the shadows. Well, this government will not. Every Australian has a right to know who is giving what to particular candidates or political parties and for what purpose. The government is committed to electoral disclosure reform. We are committed to improving the integrity of the electoral system. This is one of a number of measures that will help to restore confidence in both government and governance. The minister has already commissioned a green paper on electoral reform, which I am informed is proceeding quite nicely, and introduced a lobbyists register and a code of conduct for ministerial staff—all about reinstating standards in public life.</para>
<para>Our political system is based on equality of participation and representation by the party of a person’s choice with neither fear nor favour. This bill will strengthen the integrity of our political system as well as, just by the by, delivering savings of some $30 million over the forward estimates. I commend the bill to the Senate.</para>

<para>—It is my pleasure to rise to make a contribution to the debate on the <inline ref="R3051">Tax Laws Amendment (Political Contributions and Gifts) Bill 2008</inline> and I do so not wishing to beat about the bush. Let us be entirely honest: there are grave concerns in the public arena about the nature and operation of political donations in Australia and about our political system and its interaction with those who fund its operation. There is, as some wish to put it, a crisis of confidence—driven, as some say, by almost a cold war spending, arms race type of approach to see who can manage to outraise, outspend and outbid the other side.</para>
</talk.start>
<para>That sort of crisis of confidence is certainly not helped by headlines that we have splattered across all of today’s newspapers such as ‘Hong Kong tycoon tops ALP donors’ and ‘Labor at odds over billionaire’s advances’. These are the types of things that hurt public confidence in the system. Then people go on to read the figures that are in the newspapers. They read that some $83.9 million was funnelled through the Labor Party and its state branches around Australia last year. That does not include the $27 million spent by the trade union movement on top of that to help engineer a change of government last year. So we had a $110 million plus spend or funding binge on changing the government, driven primarily by its trade union basis, coming from the Labor Party. Little wonder there are concerns given these types of headlines talking about casino tycoons and overseas investments! These are the things that bring about serious concerns in the public arena, and justifiably so.</para>
<para>What do we have before us today? We have a bill that deals with small contributors—those who donate less than $1,500. Well, whoopty-do! What a great achievement by Special Minister of State Faulkner and the so-called reforming Rudd government, whose members come in here and dare to suggest that this is about cleaning up the Australian electoral system and political donations in Australia! Their claims are rubbish. The media and the public are not concerned about mums and dads claiming a $1,500 tax deduction because they want to support their political party. They are not even concerned about businesses that might be claiming a $100, $1,000 or $1,500 tax deduction to support the political party of their choice. Those are not their concerns. That is not where people think undue influence is coming into the political system. They think it comes from property developers like those associated with the Wollongong council whom Senator Ronaldson spoke about earlier and from the dirty politics that those types of things have seen emanate. They think it comes from casino licence operators. They might see money coming into and money going out of the one political party at the same time—the types of strange arrangements that are like a revolving door at the bank of the New South Wales branch of the ALP. Maybe the new Rudd bank system that is going to help banks to fund commercial property developers could just funnel the money through the New South Wales ALP. That would be a good way to fund property developers. Right now they are all funding the New South Wales ALP, so why not do it in reverse! This legislation does nothing to restore public confidence in the political system. It does nothing to avert the crisis of confidence in public donations that we have in Australia. It tackles the small fry donors. It tackles those who are making a genuine contribution to be involved in politics, rather than those whose contribution could be perceived as having influence over the political process—and that is where people’s concerns lie.</para>
<para>The coalition has been extremely consistent on this. This is, of course, a series of measures that have come before this chamber for the second time. It has already been inquired into by the Joint Standing Committee on Electoral Matters, where the coalition and minor parties, particularly the Greens, made it clear that we stood as one believing that these types of piecemeal reforms should be considered as part of the overall picture and that we needed the big-picture approach to this, not just some piecemeal—‘We’ll pick a little bit off here and a little bit off there’—approach as the government seemed to be pursuing. We heard from eminently qualified witnesses, during the initial inquiry into the initial bill that sought to make these changes, such as Professor Graeme Orr from Democratic Audit of Australia, whose evidence stated:</para>
<quote>
<para class="block">… it is very premature to do away with a form of encouraging small-scale donating at the same time as seriously considering, in a few months time, the banning of large corporate and organisational donations.</para>
</quote>
<para class="block">Let us home in on the key word ‘premature’. It is premature to screw down the little guys before you start tackling the bigger ones. That is what this bill does. It is premature to try to tackle these small contributions before you get into where the real estimates and issues are. It is premature because we are waiting for the document I have in my hand, the electoral reform green paper, to reach its final place. I welcome this document. I welcome the government’s commitment to produce this document and I hope that I can take the government on trust that there will be a full and open process that leads to some comprehensive reforms, stemming from the electoral reform green paper, that will actually help to avert the crisis of confidence in our electoral system and actually help to ensure that the public has confidence that money is not having undue influence over it. The problem, though, is that this paper was released only in December last year. It was released after this parliament had finished sitting. There has been no opportunity to consider the changes in this legislation within the context of the comprehensive electoral reform green paper on donations funding and expenditure that the government has released. There has been no opportunity whatsoever.</para>
<para>That is why, when this issue originally came up, the coalition stood as one with the Greens to say it should be part of the big-picture reform process—we still believe it should be a part of that process—and that this reform process should be completed before the next election. We should see reform that restores confidence for all Australians. One hopes that the parties of the government, the opposition and the crossbenches can reach agreement on this reform. If this chamber could reach consensus on true electoral reform rather than the government’s piecemeal approach, that would be a true sign of serious steps forward.</para>
<para>The lack of preparation by the government—the lack of real consideration of what might be done in this regard—becomes evident when you look at the further evidence taken by the Joint Standing Committee on Electoral Matters in its assessment of these measures. The government claims this is a savings measure. It claims there will be revenue savings. Treasury estimates that the bill—in its original form, at least, when it was considered by JSCEM, noting that it is now some time down the track and that it is in a different form—will save $31.4 million by stripping tax deductibility for small contributions to political parties. We asked for a justification for those estimations—how the government came up with a $30-odd million saving—and we got the following evidence provided back to us by the Treasury:</para>
<quote>
<para class="block">The Australian Taxation Office does not have data on the median deduction claimed for gifts and contributions or the number of taxpayers claiming any deduction.</para>
</quote>
<para class="block">They do not have any data. The Australian tax office—the people who are processing these claims for deductibility; the people upon whom presumably Treasury and the government have relied on to come up with their $31.4 million estimate—have no data. So we have the government jumping at this, trying to proclaim it as a revenue savings measure when it has absolutely no idea of how the tax office have constructed the figures it is talking about. It has no idea at all.</para>
<para>In his evidence, Professor Orr again highlighted the unreliability of these types of revenue estimates, particularly given the uncertainty around the numbers of members of political parties in Australia. Certainly most of us know that most of the speculation is that those numbers are declining, especially in the major parties. Professor Orr said:</para>
<quote>
<para class="block">… if you are talking about $10 million per year you are talking about $30 million of donations at, say, a marginal rate of 30 per cent, which is roughly the corporate rate. Thirty million dollars is a lot of $1,500 contributions or party memberships. I do not want to criticise the Treasury modelling without seeing it—</para>
</quote>
<para class="block">of course, we know that it was based on zero data—</para>
<quote>
<para class="block">but part of the problem we have is that we have not had a system where it is itemised on tax forms and we do not really have enough data on claiming, on where people’s donations are going and so on.</para>
</quote>
<para class="block">So Professor Orr was quite clear that the data was not there and the estimate seemed to be grossly overstated given that many of the types of contributions claimed would be political party memberships. Memberships are usually in the order of $50 or $60—maybe a little bit more for some parties, but that is certainly what it is in my home division of the Liberal Party in South Australia. Sometimes there are contributions in addition to that, but we are certainly not talking about everyone making their donation and then making a deduction of $1,500—far from it. I would hypothesise that the overwhelming majority of people making deductions in Australia are making deductions of about $100. These are people who genuinely wish to support a political organisation—who genuinely wish to be involved. I would have thought that, at a time of concern about the level of support and involvement in political organisations around Australia, the last thing a government that might wish to encourage further involvement in the political process would be doing is making it harder and more expensive for people. That, of course, is what this measure does.</para>
<para>In his comments, Senator Ronaldson also struck upon the fact that, if passed, this measure provides certain advantages to some party structures, given their funding base, over others. It provides particular advantages to those who generate and derive large parts of their funding from trade unions, because the memberships and subscriptions to trade unions will remain tax deductible under this legislation. So you will still be able to join a trade union and claim your tax deduction for membership of that union—the union could possibly even increase its fees as a result of the Labor Party losing tax deductibility for membership—and then the union can funnel the money off to whomever they choose to donate to. Of course, we know who they are likely to donate to from today’s newspapers, because we see that there are millions of dollars funnelled annually from the union movement into the Australian Labor Party and its branches around Australia. So we know that this measure, if passed, will allow that to continue unfettered. It will provide a backdoor for people to make donations through the trade union movement. Get the donations deducted and they will end up in the Labor Party coffers, having been deducted from people’s incomes in any event.</para>
<para>No other party is going to benefit from similar sorts of arrangements, I suggest. But the government will. So it is little wonder that, again, they are focused in here on where they can cut out those smaller contributions from individuals, small businesses and corporations. It does nothing to fix the significant multimillion dollar influence the union movement has on the Australian political system. This measure does nothing to address the overseas donors who are splashed across the front pages of today’s newspapers. It does nothing to address donations, ranging into the hundreds of thousands of dollars, from big business, from lobbyists or from developers.</para>
<para>It does not even do anything to address potentially the deductibility to lobbyists’ operations. The government likes to pride itself on the operation of its code of conduct for lobbyists. But a lobbying business, whose area of business is lobbying, can pay as much as they want to attend a stand-up networking function of any political party and claim it as a legitimate business expense. People will still be able to attend Labor Party national conferences as business observers from any number of lobbyist businesses on the governments lobbyist register, and pay their $7,000, $8,000 or $10,000 a head—whatever it is—and that will still be a deductible expense. Mums and dads will not be able to pay $50 to join their local political party branch and claim that as deductible expense. But a lobbying company will be able to claim $10,000 as a deductible expense for attending a political party conference.</para>
<para>The evidence from Treasury officials on this was quite clear:</para>
<quote>
<para class="block">… yes. If their business role is lobbying, networking and advocacy and they go to a function with political leaders in order to network, advocate and lobby, that will be just a business deduction for their business activity. There is no cap to that expense.</para>
</quote>
<para class="block">That was Treasury evidence given to the JSCEM inquiry into this matter. So we still get big donors, we still get overseas donors, we still get lobbyists and lobbying companies with unlimited tax deductibility and we still get unions deducting their contributions. All this does is hurt ordinary Australians who wish to join a political party.</para>
<para>This is a rubbish piece of piecemeal legislation designed to target, frankly, the government’s political opponents. There are very clear motives behind this. Nowadays, to be quite frank, the government party, the Labor Party and its branches, is by and large funded by the big end of town—by big contributions, either from the trade union movement or from developers, casino operators or others. It is funded by those groups. The Labor Party knows full well that, as a proportion of income, those smaller parties—Family First, the Greens and others—and the Liberal Party and the National Party receive a higher proportion of their income from smaller scale donors, such as smaller businesses or individuals who choose to be members and who choose to make individual contributions.</para>
<para>They know that this legislation will hurt every other party in this chamber more than it will hurt them. That is the motive behind this. There is nothing holy about this. No matter how much the government want to hide behind their green paper on electoral reform, there is nothing holy about that process if they are jumping the gun and pushing ahead with these types of reforms, reforms that, frankly, will be implemented to the harm of every other political party represented in this chamber.</para>
<para>That is why I urge the Senate to do what it has done before on this measure and to tell the government, ‘No.’ The Senate should say that this is not good enough in isolation and must be part of the holistic approach to electoral funding reform that the government piously say is being undertaken. If they are committed to that holistic approach, they should be happy to wrap this issue up in it. If so, perhaps we can emerge with the type of outcome that gives Australians confidence and ensures that all Australians believe that our political system is free of the type of big-money influence that has concerned so many people. That is why I urge the Senate to reject this bill this time, as it has in the past, and make sure that we undertake a proper process: a wholesale and holistic review that looks at every area of campaign funding and does not just pick on the little guys.</para>

<para>—I indicate my support for the second reading of the <inline ref="R3051">Tax Laws Amendment (Political Contributions and Gifts) Bill 2008</inline>. Despite Senator Birmingham’s very articulate exposition of his and the Liberal Party’s views, my view is that we ought to deal with this piece of legislation. It contains some reforms that, with amendment, are potentially useful in the context of what needs to be done. I believe that this Senate has an opportunity in the coming months to deal comprehensively for the first time in many years with the whole issue of electoral reform, including funding, contributions and donations and above all the issue of disclosure and transparency. That is why I welcome the work that the Special Minister of State has done in the context of the electoral reform green paper. I believe that the minister is absolutely genuine in his desire to significantly reform our system.</para>
</talk.start>
<para>I do not want us to go down the path of the United States, where you have the best democracy that money can buy. Senator Bishop outlined the many millions of dollars that were spent in the primaries in the last two years. Those amounts are simply mind-boggling. The amount that is spent in Senate races in the United States, for instance, is in the tens of millions of dollars. That is something that is fundamentally anti-democratic in its effect. It can taint a political system.</para>
<para>What we have to deal with today is the issue of the tax deductibility of political donations. While some would say that it would be preferable to deal with this holistically, I say that if there is scope for reform we should deal with it now on a transitional or interim basis pending a more comprehensive political funding and disclosure regime. In relation to the central basis of what the government is trying to do—wipe out the tax deductibility of political donations—I cannot accept that. It is important that there be a level of public participation. I believe that removing tax deductibility for any level of donation up to the current limit of $1,500 will discourage the participation of ordinary citizens in the political process. You will skew the process in favour of large corporations and unions. I do not think that that is desirable. Giving individuals an opportunity to have a deduction of up to $1,500 is not unreasonable. The revenue effect of continuing this deductibility is quite minimal in the scheme of things. It is about $30 million over three years. That is a relatively small price to pay for a greater degree of public participation. However, I believe it was a mistake of the Howard government to extend that deductibility from individuals to corporations. I believe it is appropriate that such deductibility be confined to individuals. It is individuals that participate in a direct sense. It is individuals that actually vote at the ballot box. I think that is a more appropriate approach. That is why I am particularly interested in the amendments tabled by the Greens in relation to this and am quite sympathetic to them.</para>
<para>I also think that there is an anomalous position that would arise should the government’s bill go through unamended. For instance, donations to Greenpeace would continue to be tax deductible. Greenpeace—and this is not a criticism—is very much a political organisation. It involves itself in political issues. If you consider Aristotle’s view of what politics is about, the affairs of the state, then having too narrow a definition and allowing deductions for an organisation such as Greenpeace but not for a political party or a political organisation seems to be anomalous. I also think that it would be anomalous under this government proposal for union dues and levies to be fully tax deductible but not donations to the Liberal Party, to other parties or to Independents. The fact is that the union movement makes significant financial contributions to the Labor Party. It seems that the deductibility of union dues would be a backdoor way of providing funding to the ALP. It would give them an unfair advantage. That would be the effect of this legislation. It is important to reflect on what Professor Graeme Orr of the Democratic Audit of Australia has said about these sorts of donations. He said that this would not be inconsistent with allowing for some broader fundamental reforms down the track. Tax deductibility of donations is entirely appropriate up to a reasonable level, and I believe $1,500 is reasonable, but I do not think it is appropriate that corporations continue to have that level of tax deductibility.</para>
<para>I note also that some would consider to be anomalous the fact that is that there is no attempt in this legislation to change the tax deductibility of levies that members of political parties have to pay to their party as a consequence of being endorsed or of being a member of that party. Fortunately, that is something that I do not have to worry about, but I understand that members of the Labor Party—I am not sure what the situation is for members of the Liberal Party or the Australian Greens—pay a levy in the order of eight per cent of their income, and that is deductible. Obviously, that is much more than $1,500. Some would say that is anomalous, but I can understand that it is part and parcel of being a member of a party and it is part of a pledge that some have to sign as part of getting an endorsement or of being in this place. So that sits at odds with what is being proposed.</para>
<para>I think that an appropriate balance in what I see as a transitional or interim measure in what I hope will be quite significant and far-reaching electoral reform in this country is to amend the tax deductibility of political donations so that it applies only to individuals and not to corporations. I believe that would be a step in the right direction. I look forward to the Senate dealing with comprehensive reform of electoral laws in this country, because I think it is long overdue. I hope that the green paper is part of the fruitful process of achieving those ends.</para>

<para>—I rise to speak briefly about the position of the Greens on the <inline ref="R3051">Tax Laws Amendment (Political Contributions and Gifts) Bill 2008</inline> that is before us today and also to foreshadow the amendments which we will move in the committee stage, which a number of other senators have already referred to. Firstly, I will go to the issue of whether we should be moving now or whether we should wait for the outcome of the green paper process that is afoot. The Greens will be supporting this bill with the amendment that I will speak to because it essentially removes something that to us is a no-brainer. Tax deductions for corporations to participate in the electoral process are clearly unacceptable. It is not something that the public should be supporting. We believe that there probably is merit in waiting for the consultation process to wind up before progressing with a comprehensive electoral reform package, but these are measures that are entirely appropriate to proceed with today rather than just maintaining the status quo, which is quite clearly unacceptable.</para>
</talk.start>
<para>The Greens believe—and we are firmly on the record as putting this position in state and federal parliaments—that elections should be publicly funded. It creates a much fairer and more democratic system for the public to fund political parties, independents and people seeking to express a point of view through our electoral system than the heavily out-of-balance system we have at the moment where, in a sense, corporate free speech is privileged above that of citizens. Private money plays an enormous and out-of-balance role in our political system today. Some donors, and particularly private donors—referring to some of the headlines that Senator Birmingham referred to before—are using financial assets to buy access to the political system. Current requirements for disclosure of these donations are clearly unacceptable, and that is one of the reasons we are here today. There is a perception, which I think is probably well founded, that corporate money buys political influence. That is not only damaging to our political system but also damaging to public confidence in the political system, which winds up being much the same thing. So I think there is certainly a case for the moves that the government has proposed and has put before us today to restrict tax deductibility—that is, public support—for corporations’ perceived rights to buy influence amongst decision-makers.</para>
<para>We believe that the case for restricting donations from individuals is actually much less clear. In essence, we are arguing that public participation in the political process is a public good and is therefore entirely worth supporting—with some caveats. Small donations from individuals will encourage parties to reach out to their grassroots rather than relying on very large corporate donations. So there is certainly a case for retaining tax deductibility for personal donations up to a threshold of $1,500.</para>
<para>I will now go to the make-up of funding for political parties when they run elections. The major parties receive, roughly, 80 per cent of their funding through private sources and receive the balance through public sources. The major parties receive significantly more in larger donations: roughly 80 per cent of donations are $10,000 or more, 60 per cent of donations are over $40,000 and 45 per cent of donations are $100,000 or more. There is a break-up of the way funding was received for the major and minor political parties and for Independents in the last election, and it shows quite clearly that the balance of private donations overwhelmingly favours the major parties. That profoundly unbalances the playing field. It means that some voices are much louder than others by being able to afford electoral advertising, campaign staff, administration costs and so on.</para>
<para>The Greens support strong requirements for funding disclosure. We are very keen on exploring any other options and will be proposing other options to improve the transparency, the accountability and the equity in our electoral system. The current system, I believe, is failing Australian democracy and is probably not as good as we think it is. I will speak briefly again when we move amendments in the committee stage.</para>

<para>—I rise to speak on the <inline ref="R3051">Tax Laws Amendment (Political Contributions and Gifts) Bill 2008</inline>. I was not in this chamber when the bill first came before the Senate in June last year. The substance of the bill is the same and can be summed up as the government trying to kick with a 10-goal breeze for all four quarters of the grand final, because it is a blatant and disgraceful exercise in self-interest by the Australian Labor Party.</para>
</talk.start>
<para>This so-called piece of reform achieves nothing in the way of substantive reform. It cherry-picks key measures that will avoid significantly damaging or limiting the electoral chances of the Australian Labor Party and their opportunity to raise funds at the expense of the taxpayer, assisting their re-election chances while doing much to harm the involvement of ordinary citizens in the political process and to damage the interests of other political parties. An unfair playing field is against the interests of all Australians, it is against the interests of all political parties and this bill should be treated with the contempt it deserves.</para>
<para>As I mentioned, this is not the first time it has been before this chamber and it appeared as <inline ref="R2915">Tax Laws Amendment (2008 Measures No. 1) Bill 2008</inline> last June. It will amend the Income Tax Assessment Act to remove tax deductibility of contributions or gifts to political parties, Independent members of parliament and Independent candidates for parliament. It will also ensure that GST treatment of candidates is altered to reflect the government’s policy. The coalition in the past opposed this bill because tax deductibility of political contributions was an ongoing part of a broader inquiry by the Joint Standing Committee on Electoral Matters into the 2007 election and, generally, into political funding. Senator Ronaldson commented extensively on the importance of this broader reform process and on how the government had claimed to be interested in broader reform.</para>
<para>As indicated by the minority report of the Joint Standing Committee on Electoral Matters into the original bill, the coalition strongly believes this issue should be deferred to become part of a broad based comprehensive reform when the committee’s full report comes out. I understand that the committee is meeting at the moment or was meeting at the commencement of this debate. It has released an interim report, but it is still months off its final report and the Senate does not have all the information. Senator Birmingham outlined that the tax deductibility information and the cost of that are very difficult to ascertain. The information about who donates and who makes the claims is very difficult to ascertain, and that is currently before the joint standing committee. Furthermore, it is absurd in the extreme on the government’s part to be bringing a substantive change of this nature before we have actually seen the final report of the joint standing committee and, indeed, the government’s white paper into electoral reform.</para>
<para>What we actually have at the moment, as Senator Birmingham and Senator Ronaldson have outlined, and what we saw over the last two days have had much more dramatic impact on people’s faith in the political system than anything that Senator Faulkner or the government have raised. We have seen an extraordinary amount of money spent over the last 12 months by the government. It was over $100 million and the only way to describe it is ‘American in scale’. The returns were delivered yesterday and were covered in today’s press. As has been mentioned elsewhere, the unions gave Labor $9.2 million in donations and a total of $37.6 million in overall campaign funding—indeed, the direction of the trade unions’ spending was very clear during the campaign.</para>
<para>It takes a degree of ridiculousness, if I could use that word, to actually say that the coalition is holding up electoral reform only a day after the Australian Electoral Commission released such extraordinary numbers to show the impact of trade unions on the last election. Given the lack of adequate or appropriate information about what individuals below that threshold have done, we need to have all that before the Senate.</para>
<para>This legislation has very important ramifications. The rules need to be fair in politics for them to be widely accepted and to generate public faith. There are some very serious impacts in this bill that I would like to cover. We all know that the trade union movement is the industrial wing of the Labor Party or, as it was historically described, ‘the Labor Party was the political wing of the trade union movement’. While it might occasionally, in my home state of Victoria, throw a bit of money towards the Greens it is nothing but scraps off the table compared to what the ALP gets from the trade union movement.</para>
<para>Trade unions do not exist nor funnel their money to support the Liberal Party, the National Party, the Greens, Family First or any Independents. What they do is collect money from their members—in certain sectors, interestingly, through compulsory levies for members—in order to fund political campaigns to see the election of their political wing, from the ranks of which so many members of this government have been drawn.</para>
<para>The removal of tax deductibility entrenches a massive advantage to the Labor Party through the unique position of trade unions. The disadvantage is straightforward and I will provide some numbers: $100 donated from a union to a political party or a candidate is effectively tax free because a union is an exempt body and the money from the member to the union is considered a tax deduction. But if an individual wanted to donate that money and they were on the 30 per cent marginal tax rate it would actually cost them $146. If a business that was paying the corporate tax rate wanted to provide that money it would be $142. It would not matter to whom they wanted to give the money. The point here is the difference in status between trade unions and everyone else in the community because of the unique tax exemption enjoyed by trade unions.</para>
<para>If we apply some of these numbers to the extraordinary numbers we saw released in yesterday’s press, they are even more significant. If we talk about a premium of $46 for individuals, that may not sound like much. But, when we see trade union members from all around Australia being levied $100 here and $200 there to fund political campaigns which are openly partisan and not just political in their nature, these insignificant amounts of money add up. If we actually go through the figures recently released by the Australian Electoral Commission, we have $9.2 million in donations from the various unions: $1.5 million from the Shop, Distributive and Allied Employees Association; $1.3 million from the Construction, Forestry, Mining and Energy Union; $1 million from the Communications Electrical Plumbing Union; $765,000 from the Australian Liquor, Hospitality and Miscellaneous Workers Union; $674,000 from the Electrical Trades Union; and significant sums from the Australian Manufacturing Workers Union, the Maritime Union of Australia, the Australian Workers Union, the Health Services Union, the Transport Workers Union, the Australian Services Union and the National Union of Workers.</para>
<para>We heard Senator Bishop talk, without any sense of irony, about the impact in the United States of setting up tax preferred political action committees, which are allowed to exert influence on the political process. We have those groups in Australia. We call them trade union officials. No-one else has a tax exempt status that allows them to collect millions of dollars to spend on a campaign or donate to their preferred candidates. And let us not forget that with that money come votes on the conference floor of the Labor Party. With the trade unions and the millions of dollars they collect might come 10 per cent of the delegates on a conference floor and a seat at the factional negotiating table, particularly around the Victorian ALP at the moment, where they carve up the seats in parliament—there will be a shoppie here and someone from the NUW there. Even the newspapers now describe members of the Labor Party not just as Socialist Left or Labor Unity but as representing a trade union. In fact, people in this chamber have done that themselves. No other organisation in Australia has this benefit. And let us not let the Labor Party dismiss this: the only groups in Australia that are the equivalent of American political action committees are the executives of our trade unions, who sit around doling out millions of dollars to their preferred candidates, factions and parties. Nothing has been mentioned about the money that we know exists in brown paper bags to pay for the other activities that happen within the ALP.</para>
<para>I would now like to provide an example of what might happen if trade unions were taxed. They donated just over $9 million to the Labor Party. If they had had to pay tax like any other corporate entity at the corporate tax rate or like any individual, they would have paid 30 per cent tax on that money and would have only been able to donate $6.4 million. That nearly $3 million, or $2.8 million, is in effect a subsidy from the Australian taxpayer, not to the political process—I note the comments of Senator Ludlam and Senator Xenophon about public funding—and nor is it a subsidy to all political parties or even to all members of this place; it is a subsidy to the Australian Labor Party. And that is what this bill entrenches.</para>
<para>This bill entrenches a tax advantage for the Australian Labor Party and their industrial wing. If individuals and businesses had got together and tried to run a campaign of the scale of the trade unions’ campaigns in the lead-up to the last election, it would have cost them over $38 million, if you assume a 30 per cent tax rate. Again, this is effectively a $10 million-plus subsidy to the Labor Party or a $10 million disincentive to individuals and other organisations in this country to participate politically, purely because they are not a trade union.</para>
<para>Senator Birmingham outlined the ridiculous argument put by the government that somehow public trust in Australian politics has been reduced by my mother or someone else or by a small businessman coughing up $500 to the local candidate whom they have known for a few years. Yet they are not concerned about the million dollars that the shoppies handed over. It is utterly ridiculous in the extreme to make that accusation.</para>
<para>Senator Birmingham also raised an issue about lobbyists, and again Senator Bishop referred to the power of lobbyists in the American system. We have evidence in the minority report, which Senator Birmingham highlighted, that if you are a lobbyist you can shell out all the money you want if it is an expense you have incurred in business. Is this just an official way of selling access? All this does is say that, if you are buying access as a lobbyist, you get to claim a tax deduction. But if mum and dad who own the local milk bar or the local newsagency or the local pharmacy want to cough up $1,000 to someone they have known for 10 or 15 years who is involved in the community, then they do not get a tax deduction. This is ridiculous in the extreme. This actually skews the political field so far in favour of corporatism that it goes against the little person. It does not matter whether you are an individual, whether you are a small business person or whether you are a shareholder of a company, for some reason under this bill they all get a status in the political process different to that of individuals who happen to be members of a trade union. I know trade union membership has been collapsing, but I did not realise that trade unions would go to this extreme to skew our political process to bring their membership back to higher levels.</para>
<para>I will conclude my remarks. Senator Faulkner talks about ending the arms race. Senator Faulkner is acting like the Kremlin in Soviet Union days. They went around the world preaching disarmament and funding disarmament groups, but what they were doing at the time was amassing arms. Labor want a tax advantage to magnify the outrageous figures we saw yesterday coming from large organisations. They also want to say to Mr and Mrs Australia: ‘You have no role in our political process. The union gets a donation but you don’t.’ This bill should be rejected for the extreme and outrageous proposal that it is, which is to skew the Australian political process in favour of one side at the expense of all citizens.</para>

<para>—In summing up the debate on the <inline ref="R3051">Tax Laws Amendment (Political Contributions and Gifts) Bill 2008,</inline> I thank all the senators who contributed. I will go right back to the facts, if I may. The bill honours the government’s election commitment to remove tax deductibility for donations made to political parties, candidates and members. It was a commitment made as part of Labor’s $3 billion saving plan announced by the current Minister for Finance and Deregulation on 2 March 2007.</para>
</talk.start>
<para>Currently, as we all know, deductions are allowed for donations to political parties, members of parliaments and candidates, including Independents, up to a maximum of $1,500. Donations and membership fees used to be deductible up to the lower $100 threshold prior to 2006, when the former government implemented an increase up to the current $1,500 and then expanded the deduction to donations to Independent candidates and members. However, the current measure maintains access to the GST concessions for political parties, Independent members and Independent candidates that were available to them as gift deductibility entities. This will prevent the GST compliance costs of these entities from increasing as a result of removing the income tax deductibility for political donations. The measure itself is estimated to save $10 million per annum. On the basis of that, I commend the bill to the Senate.</para>

<para>—My question is to the Minister representing the Prime Minister, Senator Evans. Would the minister tell us how many jobs were created as a result of the government’s first stimulus package?</para>

<para>—I thank Senator Bernardi for the question. What we know is that the government’s stimulus package last year provided enormous support to families, pensioners, businesses and the Australian community. What has emerged as the figures have come in in recent times is that there was a significant impact on consumer spending and consumer confidence. I think the figures from Westfield, released today, show that spending in the month of December 2008 was up 2½ per cent from the previous year.</para>

<para>—Senator, it was up 2½ per cent over the previous year in December. That is in contrast to overseas sales, which in the US were down 14 per cent and in New Zealand were down seven per cent. So what we saw in Australia over the Christmas period and the month of December was growth in spending in a number of sectors. I think what that tells you is that a lot of jobs were protected. That stimulus went to protect jobs, keep consumer confidence and increase consumer spending. I think that has been perfectly obvious. I am supported in this by Mr Richard Evans, an old parliamentary colleague from Western Australia—I think he was a Liberal at the time—who said that ‘the Rudd government has done its job with the $10.4 billion stimulus package’. When you talk to the people who are in business, who saw the impact of the stimulus, they say it worked—that it provided assistance to consumers to spend; therefore, it protected and grew jobs. What we do know is that there are a lot of jobs in retail and manufacturing in this country that directly benefited from the stimulus. Can I thank the coalition for their support in passing it.</para>

<para>—Mr President, I ask a supplementary question. I note the minister’s answer. He, by his own words, damns the Prime Minister’s statement. The Prime Minister said that the stimulus package would add 75,000 jobs. Isn’t it true that the Prime Minister of this country has misled the Australian people, Minister?</para>

<para>—I do not know what Senator Bernardi and the opposition do not get, but I suggest they go out and talk to all the workers in retail in this country. Go out and talk to all the workers in retail and ask them whether they think the stimulus package helped save their jobs and create jobs in Australia. I know what they will tell you. What we know is that, while some saved part of it, many Australian families spent it. That helped protect jobs. I am confused now. Given that the opposition were supporting the package at the time, I am now confused as to what their position is—but that is not uncommon, given the way they keep flip-flopping. But, yes, it did protect jobs and it did increase commercial activity. I think all Australians know that there are a lot more jobs because of the stimulus package than there otherwise would have been.</para>

<para>—It is an update on MYEFO and provides revised forecasts. All of that modelling was done by Treasury as part of forming the response to the current economic circumstances. On the basis of that advice and on the basis of that modelling, the figure of 90,000 jobs being created by this stimulus package in 2009-10 has been arrived at. We think that is a very good thing. We think it is a very important package, and I would urge Senator Bernardi and the opposition to support it and to help create and support jobs in our economy.</para>

<para>—I thank Senator Hurley for her question. As the Prime Minister outlined yesterday, we are facing almost unprecedented global economic circumstances. The IMF has cut its forecast for global growth three times in the last four months and is now forecasting a deep global recession. The weight of the global recession is bearing down on the Australian economy. As the Prime Minister and Treasurer have outlined, the global recession—and, in particular, the significant fall in China’s economic growth—has resulted in a $115 billion fall in Australian tax receipts to the government. In and of itself, the halving of China’s growth rates—forecast a fall to just 6.7 per cent in calendar year 2009—is expected to result in a $15 billion loss to the Australian economy over the 2009-10 period. The economic outlook for the global economy has deteriorated sharply since MYEFO. Treasury now advises a further $75 billion collapse in revenue, meaning a total of $115 billion collapse in revenue over the forward estimates. This will have a direct impact on our budget and will lead to a temporary budget deficit. The IMF has warned— <inline font-style="italic">(Time expired)</inline>

<para>—The government has also been up‑front in saying that there is no silver bullet in dealing with this global challenge, but in response to this crisis the Rudd government has been clear that it will act decisively to support growth and jobs in the period ahead. Today’s $42 billion Nation Building and Jobs Plan will provide immediate support for jobs and growth. This plan delivers a fiscal stimulus package of about two per cent of GDP in calendar year 2009 and it follows the government’s earlier actions in a range of other areas, including the $10.4 billion Economic Security Strategy package announced last October.</para>

The IMF forecasts which have been released in the last few days have indicated the magnitude of the worldwide recession. The government is also, unlike those opposite, facing up to the climate change challenge and is going to press ahead with its Carbon Pollution Reduction Scheme. We have modelled it, we have worked through these issues and we are completely confident that the world economic recession will not allow us to be deflected—unlike those opposite, who are torn between those wanting to support their leader and those who want to support their leader in this chamber.

<para>—I thank Senator Pratt for her question and for her ongoing interest in climate change and how we support the jobs of today whilst we build the jobs of tomorrow. Today the Prime Minister and the Treasurer announced a $42 billion Nation Building and Jobs Plan to support up to 90,000 jobs over the next two years, and an important part of this plan is the investment of an additional $3.9 billion in energy efficiency programs. That is $3.9 billion over and above what the Rudd government is already committed to in the context of energy efficiency policy; $3.9 billion in additional funding to make Australian homes more energy efficient and to support Australian jobs; new investment of $3.9 billion over and above the Carbon Pollution Reduction Scheme household assistance package, which is estimated to ensure around $6 billion per year to households when the scheme commences. As part of this plan the government will install ceiling insulation in around 2.7 million Australian homes; increase the rebate for solar hot water from $1,000 to $1,600 from today; and increase rebates to make rental properties more energy-efficient from $500 up to $1,000, also effective today.</para>
</talk.start>
<para>So this is investment in jobs and also investment in the sorts of changes we need to make to reduce Australia’s carbon pollution and to respond to climate change. This investment will support the jobs of tradespeople and workers employed in the manufacturing, distribution and installation of ceiling insulation during this severe global recession.

<para>—I thank Senator Pratt for the supplementary question. As I said, this delivers on our commitment in the white paper to implement energy efficiency policies ahead of the Carbon Pollution Reduction Scheme. Today’s investment will reduce emissions by a total in excess of 40 million tonnes at 2020. It is an investment to help Australian households do their bit in meeting Australia’s targets for reducing carbon pollution. As you know, Mr President, legislation for the Carbon Pollution Reduction Scheme will come forward later this year, and through this scheme the government is proposing to reduce Australia’s carbon pollution by between five and 15 per cent by 2020—that is, a reduction of between 34 and 41 per cent in the carbon footprint of every Australian man, woman and child on 1990 levels.

<para>—The government regrets the announcement by GMAC and GE Money to withdraw from the Australian financing market. Both companies stated that the global financial crisis and the financial position of their respective parent companies were the reasons for the decision. The government has moved quickly to work with industry to develop an assistance scheme for automotive dealerships. The scheme consists of a special purpose vehicle to provide liquidity to car dealer financiers, who will then be able to assist dealerships that were unable to quickly secure alternative funding following the announced withdrawal of GMAC and GE Money.</para>

<para>The special purpose vehicle became operational on 1 January 2009. The government will provide support to the SPV in the form of a guarantee expected to cover a minor proportion of the transactions with dealers. The SPV is a transitional arrangement only and will remain in place until viable dealers establish new funding arrangements. The SPV is approximately $2 billion. It will operate with government support refinancing dealerships for a period— <inline font-style="italic">(Time expired)</inline>

How many pieces of legislation will the government be presenting to the parliament to seek the implementation of that package?

<para>—I thank Senator Brown for the questions. Senator Brown, my information is that there will be five bills introduced to the House of Representatives tomorrow. I will check if that is not correct, but I think that it is five bills. They will seek to give effect to the package, the Nation Building and Jobs Plan, announced by the Prime Minister today. I understand that they will be brought on in the House of Representatives for debate tomorrow.</para>
</talk.start>
<para>In terms of when they reach the Senate and when we will have the opportunity to debate them, I cannot give precise details other than to indicate that it is my intention to talk to the leader of each of the parties and the Independents this afternoon about the question of the bills and the time lines required for implementation of each of those bills. Some of them will be time sensitive because of the operative dates that are required to implement payments. A number of them provide tax bonuses et cetera. Part of the whole stimulus package is designed to try to get that money into the economy in the second half of this financial year and to get that money to help support jobs and growth in the economy quickly. That is why the package has been designed in that way.</para>
<para>So there are tight time lines involved. Clearly the Senate will want to consider the legislation and we will enter into discussions with the opposition and the minor parties and Independents about how best we manage that. I have already had a quick chat to Senator Minchin across the table, but we will formally do that this afternoon or this evening. We have been constrained a bit by the fact that the package was not announced until just prior to question time, but obviously we will want to engage with you in discussion about those matters. <inline font-style="italic">(Time expired)</inline>

If so, how is that going to be done in an informed and responsible way? Was the government unable to release the package or any component of it until today? Would the minister check one statistic which I have, the ceiling insulation program for 2.7 million Australian houses which do not have it? The Australian Bureau of Statistics figures are that there are 3.9 million Australian houses without ceiling insulation.

I will brief you on the time limits required by the government to get the legislation passed and implement the payments, and I will do that this afternoon. I will look to find a cooperative way through so that the Senate has the appropriate opportunity to look at the legislation but also to ensure that the government is able to implement its package. It is a package designed as an emergency response to a worsening financial situation and, clearly, the package is designed to have some immediate impact on the economy.

<para>—On the second part of the supplementary question, clearly, this is a very detailed statement of both the financial situation that now confronts Australia and the deepening financial crisis and its impact on our budget and the forecasts and a very large response of more than $40 billion by the government. All that detail is certainly in the package. I am not in any way trying to keep the discussion on these matters private, but I think that we make more progress by having interaction about what is possible in relation to the progressing of the legislation. In terms of your concern about the ceiling insulation, I think that the difference may be between privately owned homes and rental properties and other properties. I will check that for you and get back to you.</para>

This government has made very clear its attitude to what has caused the economic crisis that the world is now engulfed in. It is the neoliberalist policies which those opposite have championed that have led to a situation where we now face the worst crisis since the Great Depression. This crisis was created by an ideology of unrestrained greed, which was championed by those opposite and is of course maintained by them even today. They have obviously learnt nothing and have forgotten nothing in terms of their experiences.

<para>—Thank you, Senator Minchin, for the question. The government will not be commenting on the detail of proposals or speculating on the outcomes of the request for proposals processed while the report is being considered. Let me be clear: those opposite have continued once again, as I indicated in the answer to the previous question, to play both sides of the street. On the one hand, Senator Minchin has wanted to claim that the process is a farce and the process has collapsed, yet, on the other, now he is demanding that we sign a contract apparently by March. We have indicated that that is our ambition. But to speculate further, as Senator Minchin has continued to do, would undermine negotiations that are commercial in nature and go to the heart of the probity and integrity of this process. Senator Minchin should know better, because when we received the report the evaluation had occurred at arm’s length. The government had not seen the contents of any proposal, nor had it received detailed briefings on any proposal from the panel of experts.</para>

<para>—On the point of order, Mr President: clearly Senator Conroy has been directly relevant to the question. He has been talking about national broadband and it is difficult amongst the hubbub from the opposition but perhaps they could listen more closely in respect of the response by Senator Conroy. He has been directly relevant to the question. His answer has been about the national broadband rollout. In this process the opposition should of course listen to the question and answer. The difficulty that is always faced here is when the question is framed in such a way that it presupposes an answer, whereas in this instance they should listen to the answer being given.</para>

I have already stated that we are not going to comment on the ongoing discussions that are taking place, because they go to the heart of commercial matters. They go to the heart of the government’s negotiating position. So—this is for those opposite—the regulatory framework goes to the heart of these commercial issues.

We have a complete rewind from Senator Minchin in that he is adopting Senator Coonan’s failed policy positions. Let me be clear: Labor’s election commitment will be delivered. But let’s not get away from the cant and hypocrisy of those opposite. When Senator Minchin was in charge of finance, he undertook a number of scoping studies in relation to Medibank Private, ComLand, the Defence Housing Authority and the Albury-Wodonga Development Corporation. These scoping studies were all undertaken under Senator Minchin’s watch. He would not comment on them and he did not release them. <inline font-style="italic">(Time expired)</inline>

<para>—It is a pity, Senator Abetz, you were not able to listen to this. The government has today announced it will be boosting jobs and investing in Australia’s long-term future by building or upgrading buildings in every one of Australia’s 9,450 schools. This $14.7 billion Building the Education Revolution initiative is a massive shot in the arm for our economy and for our education system. It highlights the government’s determination to significantly improve the educational outcomes for all Australian students. Building the Education Revolution is a long-term investment in improving the quality of our school facilities, no matter where that school is or whether it is a government school or a non-government school. Building the Education Revolution will also support local communities. It will be a condition of funding that schools make the new facilities, such as the halls and libraries, available for community use at no or low cost.</para>

<para>Building the Education Revolution will begin this financial year and will be rolled out over the next three years. It will be delivered through cooperation between the Commonwealth and the state and territory governments and the non-government school sector. This is an historic initiative that reverses a decade of neglect and lays the foundations for the future. This is an initiative that provides genuine opportunities for all children in the Commonwealth of Australia. This is an opportunity for all schools and all communities to address some of the fundamental needs facing these communities. <inline font-style="italic">(Time expired)</inline>

<para>—This initiative builds on other education revolution initiatives, including the $2.5 billion Trades Training Centres in Schools Program. Building the Education Revolution brings forward up to $110 million to fund quality proposals in round 2 of the Trade Training Centres in Schools Program. The government has also today announced the $511 million training and learning bonus, which provides for an upfront, one-off bonus to assist eligible students with their costs for the 2009 academic year. It also provides a temporary additional incentive for social security recipients to return to education and training. This incentive will be available until June 2010. Around 440,000 students and people returning to study will be paid this one-off cash bonus. I look forward to the opposition supporting these initiatives. <inline font-style="italic">(Time expired)</inline>

<para>—I understand the confected anger being put forward by Senator Williams.

The minister has made it clear that the New South Wales government needs to fix this situation as a priority. I understand that steps are being taken.</para>
</talk.start>
<para>It is a pity that the opposition when in government ripped a billion dollars out of the health system. These are challenges that are being addressed. We are taking the action that the previous government failed to take. For too long, hospitals have been starved of money. The previous government ripped one billion dollars from public hospitals. That put them under enormous pressure and strain. That was unnecessary at the time, and it continues to have an ongoing effect in New South Wales and in other states, Senator Williams.</para>
<para>I note the member for Dickson’s comment last week on 2SM when he said, ‘The issue at Dubbo hospital of course has been around for a while,’ and, ‘The hospital and public health issues in general have been around, frankly, for the last 10 years.’ That is what the member for Dickson said. That begs this question: why oh why did the Liberals pull money out of the public hospital system in the first place? You have already recognised that the system has failed because you pulled a billion dollars out of the system. This Commonwealth government is implementing lasting reform to improve the Australian healthcare system for the people of New South Wales and other states as well. <inline font-style="italic">(Time expired)</inline>

This is about putting in place the infrastructure and the money to provide services in New South Wales and in other states. This will make sure that those employed in providing frontline health care will be there to do it. The Commonwealth government’s package will reduce pressure on public hospitals and assist states and territories to improve the quality and effectiveness of health care and provide flexibility in how they deliver those services to Australian people.

<para>—This only demonstrates the difficulty with a supplementary question that is prewritten. I provided the answer. For those on the other side—and perhaps that includes Senator Williams—who did not hear that answer, this government is taking action, unlike the previous government. There is $1.1 billion to train more doctors, nurses and other health professionals; $500 million to improve subacute care services; and $750 million in 2008-09 for emergency departments. That is what we have put on the table. Through the November 2008 Council of Australian Governments, a historic package of reform for the health and hospital system emerged. That package will provide $64.4 billion over five years for the health system. It is a shame that Senator Williams does not understand the commitment that we have made to hospital systems right across Australia. This is unlike the opposition when they were in government.

<para>That the Senate take note of the answers given by ministers to questions without notice asked today.</para>
</motion>
<para class="block">Today we had the release of the new so-called fiscal package. The only way that we can judge this current package is on the last one. That is the only way that we can with some semblance of veracity work out what this package might do. I note the claims that were made before the release of the last package. It was claimed that it was going to create 75,000 jobs but we now know that those jobs do not exist. It was a flop; it was a fiasco. The Australian people were taken for a ride. The debt is there—we have to pay that back—but the package had no real effect.</para>
<para>I noted one of the last questions asked by one of the reporters of Mr Rudd today. They asked how this package related to current IR policy and the ETS. He conveniently talked about IR doctrine but deliberately ignored the ramifications of the ETS on Australian working families and on jobs because he knows, we know, you know and Mr Howes from the AWU knows that it will put people out of work. The reality is that it will be completely regressive on the whole concept of keeping people in work. The Labor Party selectively feign concern about the economy, but at the same time they are belligerent and maligning in that they wish to go forward and put people out of work by reason of a new tax which will be completely regressive and will dampen down the Australian economy. That is a fact. They cannot possibly bring in a tax on all things without putting people out of work.</para>
<para>Now we have this morphing of the lexicon by the Labor Party. They are no longer creating jobs; they are ‘supporting’ jobs, whatever that means. So, of the 10,749,400 people who were in work in December, which ones will actually be supported or, if there are only 90,000 people still in work at the end of the day, will Labor say, ‘They were the ones we were supporting’? It is a very rubbery and deceitful way to go about delivering a supposed outcome to the Australian people. Then we have this fanciful and ridiculous idea that we are going to reinvigorate the economy through ceiling insulation. It has become Disneyland stuff, the idea that we are going to have armies of green people ascending through people’s roofs to bring back to Australia a sense of economic balance and hope.</para>
<para>These are the sorts of things that we see at the front end of this package. We also see at the front end that this package is going to be about schools. The government are going to build multipurpose halls as a way of reinvigorating the Australian economy. It is a great metaphor, but is it actually going to do it? These are the questions that the coalition will be asking. We demand on behalf of the Australian people that you not waste this $42 billion like you wasted the last lot of money in the last stimulus package. We demand the capacity to do this job in the Senate and to make sure that you are held to account. We will not be railroaded into this moral sense of, ‘We demand that you agree to this right now and, if you do, everything will be fine.’ We see what Senator Evans is up to. He said it today. He said, ‘But you agreed to the first fiscal stimulus package.’ I hate to inform him that some of us did not. Overall, there was a sense of scepticism and a sense of trust that you would do the right thing, but you did not. There was no modelling on the last package. From what we can see at this point in time, there has been no modelling on this one, just fanciful ideas and ridiculous little trinkets bundled up into a package and forced on us to give the Australian people the sense that you are doing something. Doing something does not necessarily mean doing the right thing. What will be determined by the proper process of this Senate is whether you are doing the right thing.</para>
<para>We can see right now the battles that are going on in the Labor Party as the Labor states line up to basically just take the money and put it in their bank accounts. You say, ‘We are going to stand up to the states.’ You have not so far; you have been unable to stop the buck going anywhere. You have these mountains of debts in state governments who are chewing your head off. Now we have the true question of whether this government has the capacity to deliver to its people basic services such as rail and health. The fact is that services are falling to pieces around the ears of the Australian Labor Party. That is what is going on. If you are going to ride roughshod over the Australian budget and take the Australian people— <inline font-style="italic">(Time expired)</inline>

<para>We know from the contributions of my colleagues during question time that our tax receipts have been reduced—in part, obviously, because of the slowing of the economy but particularly because of the slowing of the global economy and the impact on our capacity to engage and sell our exports. We are faced with a global recession, having already pushed our budget into deficit even before we take this decisive policy action with the $42 billion package announced today.</para>
<para>This package is historic, it is visionary and it targets all of the key areas designed to assist Australia in getting through this difficult time. But it does so with an eye to the future. The focus on Building the Education Revolution and investing in our schools is unmatched. We know there has been investment in schools’ programs before, but never to the degree that has been proposed by federal Labor today and never with the degree of integration with the roles that schools play in our respective communities. Some of the elements of that particular package and Building the Education Revolution include large-scale infrastructure investments in libraries and halls in primary schools, special schools and K-12 schools across Australia to the tune of $12.4 billion. Having worked in the sport portfolio and the local government portfolio previously, I can tell you that this is so needed in communities, whether they be outer metropolitan, inner city, regional or rural. It is this kind of investment that stitches communities together. By targeting this particular package in this way, not only will we drive opportunities for local businesses and jobs but also we will provide the kind of social infrastructure that will allow these communities to consolidate, build and grow through very difficult economic times.</para>
<para>I congratulate my colleagues on the thoughtfulness that underpins the announcements today. This is in stark contrast to what we have heard from the opposition—certainly from Senator Joyce but also I presume from the coalition opposition generally. For whatever reason, they decided to have a climate change deniers’ rant on this important day instead of discussing the primary issue and focus of question time today, which was the state of the economy and Labor’s second stimulus package. Why on earth they chose not to focus on these critical issues I do not know.</para>
<para>I know my colleagues will address some of the other issues, but in summary, yes, there is an investment package for building insulation. Why? Because we are facing several challenges at the moment. One of them, of course, is the global financial crisis and the impact on our economy, but another one is climate change. How clever and how forward-thinking is it to not only combine the two and look at stimulating the economy but also rectify the significant problem of energy inefficiency in our suburban homes? The insulation program is perfectly designed to address both of those issues in a thoughtful and visionary way that will stimulate jobs where they are needed during economically tough times. I would also like to mention the investment into housing of 20,000 new social and defence homes, again targeting where the need is at a time when we need to stimulate jobs and to specifically resolve a social crisis that the Rudd government has identified as a priority area. <inline font-style="italic">(Time expired)</inline>

<para>—Senator Bernardi asked a very simple but important question in question time today: how many jobs were created as a result of the government’s first stimulus package? Had any jobs been created the answer would have been a very simple one, but what do we have? We have the minister standing there for two minutes rambling on about how the stimulus package had protected jobs. In other words, no new jobs were created. And I hasten to tell the minister that there is a big difference between protecting jobs and creating jobs, especially when the Prime Minister of Australia told the people of Australia last year that the first stimulus package would add 75,000 jobs. It does not auger well for Labor’s second stimulus package. Actions speak louder than words. How things have changed.</para>
</talk.start>
<para>After only 14 months of Rudd and Labor, Australia is less prosperous, our economy is rapidly getting weaker and the outlook for Australian families is more uncertain than ever. The Rudd government are not measuring up. All we hear from Mr Rudd is blame-shifting. They tell us that jobs are being lost due to the global financial crisis and, most recently in Mr Rudd’s latest essay, the neoliberal policy of wave after wave of tax cuts. Since when have tax cuts been bad for the economy? Of course there is a global financial crisis; we all acknowledge that. However, it is the gross mismanagement by the Labor government and their policy approach to the global financial crisis that have resulted in the Australian economy being where it is today.</para>
<para>On this side of the chamber we advocate that every element of government policy should be focused on effective measures which will ensure that employment in Australia remains high, not focused on measures that will result in jobs being lost. On this side we believe in policies that will create jobs, not destroy jobs. However, despite the current economic environment, the Labor Party continues to introduce policies that are irresponsible and will result in job losses, despite its rhetoric about the creation of jobs.</para>
<para>Those opposite are ignoring the lessons of incompetent past Labor governments. You cannot spend your way out of trouble. You are introducing policies that will do long-term harm to Australia and Australians. Look at your approach to industrial relations; look at your approach to an emissions trading scheme—they are policies that will result in job losses. In fact it was farcical to hear the Prime Minister, today, say, ‘It would take my breath away for the government to consider new taxes during a time of economic crisis.’ Has he conveniently forgotten his plan to slug Australians with one of the biggest new taxes we have ever seen—the ETS? The coalition is committed to one of the most important objectives of economic management in ensuring that every Australian has the opportunity to work, which is a fundamental responsibility of responsible government.</para>
<para>Let me say it slowly again for those on the other side of the chamber, who do not seem able to grasp the most basic filter against which all policies need to be implemented: jobs, jobs, jobs. And I mean job creation, not job losses. What are those on the other side committed to? We all know; we experienced it last year—spin over substance. Australia was in a position of strength at the outset of the global financial crisis thanks to the sound economic management of the former Howard government and Peter Costello. What do we have now? You on the other side have destroyed the Australian economy. It is not an achievement to be proud of. I will quote your Prime Minister on Sky News today:</para>

<para class="block">Just remember, Mr Rudd, this is your deficit—it is of your own making and because of your mismanagement of the economy.

<para>—It is very curious to hear the opposition trying to find their way around the economy and the economic package. They acknowledge that there is a global financial crisis, but then they say that Australia should be totally immune from it, that there should not be any job losses and that there should not be any impact on the budget. They imply that the Rudd government has caused this situation. I presume that they will get their strategy sorted out eventually. It is very interesting to hear the Liberal Party talk about these kinds of issues and make grand statements like ‘not spending your way out of a crisis’ while not actually addressing what the government is doing, saying what is specifically wrong with the stimulus package that they supported last year, or putting forward proposals which they believe would create jobs. As I said, I look forward to hearing their response when they have sorted out their views on the economy and the economic package.</para>
</talk.start>
<para>The Rudd government has today announced a $42 billion Nation Building and Jobs Plan. This Nation Building and Jobs Plan will protect, support and create jobs because it is a very well-targeted package. It is well targeted to those very areas that the former government did not address when it had money rolling in. The terms of trade were excellent, we had a resources boom, had a good global financial situation and had money rolling in in the form of taxes. What it did not address was infrastructure, training, education or an environmental strategy. In developing this package, the Rudd government is not only responding to the current global financial crisis but also making sure that those things that were neglected previously are not neglected this time, despite the handicap it faces of a global downturn.</para>
<para>The lack of work on infrastructure around Australia meant that Australia did not benefit in the way it could have from its export potential and from its job creation potential during the time of the former government. This applies even more so to training and education. It was acknowledged that there was an acute crisis in not only building and construction trades but also other areas like engineering and science. We just did not have enough of these people to ensure that we took advantage of those good economic conditions during the time of the former government. Further, the former government did not ensure in any way that its environmental strategy meant a sustainable future and continued economic growth for Australians.</para>
<para>The government’s plan not only addresses the fact that we will have a $115 billion hit on our budget revenues but also makes sure that we will be well placed in the future to recover from the current economic situation and go on to build a stronger Australia. The jobs plan provides immediate support for jobs and growth in our economy. It will stimulate growth of about a half of one per cent of GDP in 2008-09 and of around three-quarters to one per cent in 2009-10. It will support up to 90,000 jobs over the next two years. That is a wonderful achievement when we see Europe, the United States and China in dire economic circumstances. There are countries around the world that are already in recession, and some of them are almost in economic meltdown. The fact that our government can put together a package that will mean we will have that kind of result over the next couple of years is an excellent response.</para>
<para>The forecast budget deficit for 2008-09 is $22.5 billion, or 1.9 per cent of GDP. Australia will have to go into deficit to allow this package to be implemented, but the government is committed to restoring the economic situation. <inline font-style="italic">(Time expired)</inline>

<para>—I stand today to take note of the answers by Senator Evans to questions from Senator Bernardi regarding jobs and specifically the number of jobs created as a result of the first economic stimulus package announced before the last election and implemented by the Rudd Labor government. It was a simple question: how many jobs were created? And the good senator was unable to answer that question. In fact, he fumbled and gave a spiel that went on and on, without providing any answer—not even an estimate.</para>
</talk.start>
<para>Prior to the election, the Prime Minister announced that the economic stimulus package would add 75,000 Australian jobs to the Australian economy. This is a point that Senator Cash made well and persuasively in her contribution to the Senate. Seventy-five thousand jobs is a lot of jobs, and they would deliver growth and development and good results for 75,000 families. That would have been a good thing, but it has not eventuated. We do not know exactly how many jobs have flowed from the package, and even the government do not know.</para>
<para>One of the key points here is that the government have not done their homework. They have not done their modelling. They have not done the research. We are concerned that the package was a knee-jerk reaction. We are concerned—and this is a growing trend with the Rudd Labor government—that it is all spin and no substance. The government are into the headlines and the quick political fix. They are good on the PR to get the headlines and attract media attention, but in terms of delivering long-term solutions—growth, development, jobs and security for Australian families—they are deficient big time.</para>
<para>An example in the last 10 days of these flaws was the announcement of the Ruddbank. It was a 1½ page media release announcing a $4 billion initiative, which comprises equity from the Australian government—taxpayers’ money of $2 billion—and equity from the banks of $2 billion,. It will provide from $26 billion to $30 billion for commercial property loans into the future. This announcement was made in a 1½ page media release. There was no detail, no homework, no modelling and no evidence to support that this was the way to go. The Prime Minister announced at the time that this initiative would save 50,000 Australian jobs. Where is the evidence of that? Where is the evidence that jobs are either going to be created or going to be saved?</para>
<para>They have been found out with respect to the first economic stimulus package. ‘Seventy-five thousand jobs will be created.’ Well, they have not been created. Where are those jobs? In terms of that first economic stimulus package, let me just ask this question. I understand, based on the figures provided by the government, that an estimated $50 million has been paid to some 70,000 Australians overseas. Well, the package was designed to stimulate the Australian economy, not overseas economies. So what is the rationale behind providing those funds? Surely the Australian economy should be the focus, the objective—not overseas economies. I hope the government has a good answer to that. Is there a need for a review of our policies in this regard? An estimated $50 million of taxpayers’ money has gone overseas as part of that economic stimulus package.</para>
<para>With respect to the Ruddbank, I think it is very much a dud and a dodgy proposal. It seems to me to be, indeed, anticompetitive. Why is it not anticompetitive, when the funds are only going to the four big banks? This will help the big banks. Yes, it may create one or two jobs at the big banks and it will certainly, it seems, help commercial property developers. But what about the mums and dads, the normal families out there that need support during this time of insecurity created in large part, in substantial part, by the Rudd Labor government. There is little evidence to support the merit of the Ruddbank proposal. This government should be aware of that from statements in the <inline font-style="italic">Financial Review</inline> today. The editorial was scathing in some of its observations. It says this about the 50,000 jobs:</para>

<motion>
<para>That the Senate record its deep regret at the death, on 4 January 2009, of Private Gregory Sher, while on combat operations in Afghanistan, and place on record its appreciation of his service to his country, and tender its profound sympathy to his family in their bereavement.</para>
</motion>
<para class="block">On behalf of government senators, and I am sure on behalf of all senators, I wish to express my heartfelt condolences to Private Sher’s parents, Yvonne and Felix; his partner, Karen; and his two brothers, Steven and Barry. I know that a number of members of Private Sher’s family are present in the gallery today. They should, please, accept our heartfelt condolences and sympathies for their terrible loss. We know that there are a large number of people—family, friends and fellow service men and women—who feel the loss very deeply.</para>
<para>Private Sher was known as a dedicated and courageous soldier and has been described by his family as ‘a man of purpose and committed determination; an extremely positive person with a kind soul’. Private Sher was born in South Africa in 1978 and migrated to Australia with his family in 1986. He joined the Army in 1998 as an Army Reserve infantryman. Private Sher went on to become a member of the 2nd Company, 1st Commando Regiment, and was with the Special Operations Task Group element that deployed to Tarin Kowt in Afghanistan’s Oruzgan province. There is no higher calling in Australia than to serve our nation in uniform, and Private Sher did this with distinction in both East Timor and Afghanistan. For his service in East Timor, Private Sher received the Australian Active Service Medal, the United Nations Transitional Authority in East Timor Medal and the Infantry Combat Badge. Private Sher has also been awarded the Afghanistan Campaign Medal, the NATO Medal with ISAF Clasp, the Australian Defence Medal and the Returned from Active Service Badge.</para>
<para>Private Sher lost his life in Afghanistan while serving his nation with courage and honour. I know all members of parliament feel very deeply the loss of servicemen like Private Sher. We take our responsibilities in committing Australian troops to combat very seriously. We feel the weight of that decision and we know that people like Private Sher take on the burden of the nation in putting their lives on the line. Unfortunately, Private Sher paid the absolute penalty—the loss of his young life. I have done a lot of farewells to see off troops departing for Iraq, Timor and Afghanistan. The enthusiasm of the soldiers—their commitment to their job, their eagerness to put into practice their training, and their eagerness to serve their country and to do well—always strikes me. This is in contrast to the parents, who are very proud but live in fear of those children not returning. The conversations you have with those who are left behind and worry for them are always quite different. I know his family must be devastated by the loss. As I said, our thoughts are with them.</para>
<para>I had reason to have a chat to my son about the Vietnam War a month or so ago. He is 17. I was telling him about conscription, going to Vietnam and the thought that he might come out of the lottery. I was just young enough—it is hard to believe—to miss that period in our history. Our young men—and women now—go into such danger. He found it quite hard to come to terms with the idea that he may have been called upon to make that sort of sacrifice. I guess he showed his youth, but he also showed the benefit of the peaceful time we have had. That, of course, has ended with the service that our service personnel have had to provide in Iraq, East Timor and Afghanistan. We are now obviously suffering losses in Afghanistan that are very concerning. These are terrible tragedies for the families and the Defence Force, but I think there is a commitment on behalf of Australians and all politicians that the mission they take on is a very worthy one—that is, it is absolutely necessary for us to defeat the Taliban and the terrorist forces that are using Afghanistan as a base. Private Sher’s commitment and contribution will long be recognised by this nation as being very much in the national interest.</para>
<para>We are very grateful for Private Sher and his service and grateful for his family and their support of him. On behalf of the Australian government and all members of the Senate, we offer our support to his family, friends and fellow soldiers, and we mourn his passing.</para>

<para>—On behalf of the coalition, I rise to support the motion moved by Senator Evans. The Liberal and National parties join in offering our sincere condolences to the family of Private Greg Sher, who lost his life while serving our country in Afghanistan. The coalition is deeply saddened by the tragic death of Private Sher, who was killed on 4 January this year when Taliban insurgents fired a rocket at an Oruzgan provincial patrol base. Private Sher was highly regarded by his colleagues of the 1st Commando Regiment and those he served with in the Special Operations Task Group. He was also held in high regard in Melbourne, where he initially trained, having come to this country, as Senator Evans said, from South Africa. Private Sher was an experienced member of the ADF, having joined the Australian Army in 1998 and having served in East Timor in 2002. In a statement released after his death, Private Sher’s family described him as a ‘man of purpose and committed determination’. They said:</para>

<para>He was the sort of mate who would do anything for anyone, and his friends knew him for the great guy that he was.</para>
<para>He was a loyal and loving family member who always put his family high on his list of priorities.</para>
</quote>
<para class="block">Our thoughts and prayers are very much with Private Sher’s family at this most wretched of times for them.</para>
<para>Private Sher was the eighth Australian soldier that we have lost in the conflict in Afghanistan, and his death again highlights the dangers that our personnel face every day in that country. As a member of the cabinet that first committed our troops to Afghanistan, the fight against the Taliban remains vitally important. Our troops are assisting the Afghani people with their own security and with building their own democracy and are helping to ensure that Afghanistan does not again become a haven for terrorists. We do not take for granted the work that our troops are doing there. We appreciate the bravery and professionalism of our forces as they face enormous challenges in Afghanistan against a vicious and hostile Taliban insurgency. We are reminded of the important sacrifices made by our ADF personnel and their families every day when on deployment in Iraq, Afghanistan, East Timor or the Solomon Islands.</para>
<para>Private Sher made the ultimate sacrifice for his country, and we will remain forever indebted to him for that. To Private Sher’s family: we offer our sincere condolences for your great loss. Private Sher was clearly an honourable and talented man who will be missed by all those who knew him. I also take this opportunity to send on behalf of the coalition our best wishes to all those Australian personnel still serving in Afghanistan and elsewhere and to their families at home.</para>

It is absolutely imperative that his family know that throughout this chamber our thoughts and prayers go out to them, that we cannot fathom the depth of sadness that they would be feeling at this moment and that, in some small way, we completely recognise the sacrifice that Gregory Michael Sher has made on behalf of his nation—a nation that he travelled to, a nation that he became a part of.

<para>Formerly being a member of the Army Reserve myself, I also admire that he was a person whose dedication to the Army was immense.

<motion>
<para>That the Senate records this occasion of national significance in the awarding of the Victoria Cross to Trooper Mark Donaldson, VC, on 16 January 2009.</para>
</motion>
<para class="block">I would first like to note the support of the chamber for the preceding condolence motion and the contributions of senators, which were very heartfelt and, I think, very appropriate. While this is also a matter closely related to an engagement in Afghanistan, it is on a much happier note in that it celebrates the bravery of Trooper Donaldson—and I think it also represents recognition of the bravery of all our forces serving in Afghanistan.</para>
<para>The Victoria Cross is the pre-eminent award for acts of bravery in wartime and is Australia’s highest military honour. It is awarded to those who ‘in the presence of the enemy display the most conspicuous gallantry; a daring or pre-eminent act of valour or self-sacrifice; or extreme devotion to duty’. Not only is Trooper Donaldson the first Australian in 40 years to receive this award but he is also the very first to receive the Victoria Cross of Australia, which was established 20 years ago as the national form of this highest military honour. I think everyone celebrates the fact that Australia now recognises its own heroes rather than relying on the recommendations of English generals, who generally did not take a balanced view of such things. Trooper Donaldson is responsible for a tremendous act of bravery, and the recognition of that with the awarding of the Victoria Cross is highly significant.</para>
<para>On 2 September 2008, Trooper Donaldson was travelling in a coalition vehicle convoy in Afghanistan’s Oruzgan province when it was ambushed by a Taliban force while returning to base. During an early stage of the battle, Trooper Donaldson deliberately exposed himself to enemy fire on a number of occasions to draw attention away from the wounded. After two hours of fierce fighting, the patrol finally extracted itself from the ambush but soon realised that a severely wounded coalition force interpreter had been left behind. Trooper Donaldson’s citation says:</para>
<quote>
<para class="block">Of his own volition and displaying complete disregard for his own safety, Trooper Donaldson moved alone, on foot, across approximately 80 metres of exposed ground to recover the wounded interpreter. His movement, once identified by the enemy, drew intense and accurate machine gun fire from entrenched positions. Upon reaching the wounded coalition force interpreter, Trooper Donaldson picked him up and carried him back to the relative safety of the vehicles then provided immediate first aid before returning to the fight.</para>
</quote>
<para class="block">…         …         …</para>
<quote>
<para class="block">Trooper Donaldson’s acts of exceptional gallantry in the face of accurate and sustained enemy fire ultimately saved the life of a coalition force interpreter and ensured the safety of the other members of the combined Afghan, US and Australian force.</para>
</quote>
<para class="block">Trooper Donaldson’s actions displayed exceptional courage in circumstances of great peril and are in keeping with the finest traditions of the Special Operations Command, the Australian Army and the Australian Defence Force. Through his deeds, Trooper Donaldson has brought great honour upon himself, his family, the Australian Defence Force and our nation.</para>
<para>In acknowledging the awarding of the Victoria Cross, I also think it is worth noting the role that Afghan interpreters and other support persons play and the danger they put themselves in in serving our armed forces. It was the same situation in Iraq, and a number of those people have been assisted to settle in Australia because of the dangers they faced as a result of the services they provided. I think that is a very good development and I think similar action may well be required in Afghanistan at some stage.</para>
<para>It is with great pleasure that I move this motion today. I think everyone throughout Australia recognises the significance of the Victoria Cross and the rarity of its awarding because of the requirement for such extreme bravery to be exhibited. As the son of a Welsh parent, I grew up with the memory of the 12 VCs awarded before breakfast at Rorke’s Drift to Welshmen serving there which is part of Welsh legend and national identity. It is good that we honour not only those who receive the Victoria Cross but also those they represent in terms of the broader defence forces. I have great pleasure in congratulating Trooper Mark Donaldson on the awarding of his VC.</para>

<para>—I am pleased to rise on behalf of the coalition to support the motion moved by Senator Evans—despite his Welsh-inspired reflection upon English generals! We offer our sincere congratulations to Trooper Mark Donaldson VC on being awarded this highest of military honours, the Victoria Cross, for his gallantry in service in Afghanistan. As Senator Evans quite rightly said, the significance of this award must not be understated, nor should the courage and bravery displayed by Trooper Donaldson. He has joined the ranks of fewer than 100 Australians who have been awarded this honour in our history, spanning 150 years since the first Australian, Captain Howse, was awarded this honour. Warrant Officer Keith Payne was the most recent recipient before Trooper Donaldson, and that was as long ago as 1969, for bravery in the Vietnam War.</para>
</talk.start>
<para>The circumstances that led to Trooper Donaldson’s award are a reminder of the extraordinary dangers facing our personnel in Afghanistan. The fact that he faced enemy fire during an ambush in which he ultimately saved the life of not a fellow Australian but an Afghani interpreter with the coalition force and administered medical assistance to wounded coalition soldiers really is extraordinary. His actions under enemy fire are worthy of this honour and a testament to the professionalism and capability of the whole of the ADF and its personnel. The Chief of the Defence Force, Air Chief Marshal Angus Houston, reflected properly the pride of the ADF in Trooper Donaldson’s actions when he said:</para>
<quote>
<para class="block">I ask you all to contemplate Trooper Donaldson’s selfless and courageous act of mateship and loyalty—not only to his fellow Aussie comrades but to the Afghani interpreter whose life he undoubtedly saved.</para>
<para class="block">We in the Australian Defence Force stand united in our pride as one of our own is admitted into the most exclusive of military fraternities.</para>
<para class="block">Trooper Donaldson has been inducted into the ranks of those military personnel deemed to be the most gallant; the most heroic; the most devoted.</para>
<para class="block">He joins a band of brothers so admired for their valour that there are only ten surviving members in the world today.</para>
</quote>
<para class="block">Trooper Donaldson truly deserves this award and everything it embodies: valour in wartime. He joins a list of distinguished military personnel who have been awarded this top honour and have been duly recognised for their valour.</para>
<para>It is further testament, I think, to the character of Trooper Donaldson that he has accepted this honour with great humility, paying tribute to all our soldiers as heroes. In his own words:</para>
<quote>
<para class="block">I don’t see myself as a hero. I was in Afghanistan just doing my job. My training and my instincts took over on the day.</para>
</quote>
<para class="block">That is a very Australian thing to say. Trooper Donaldson immediately indicated that he would loan his VC to the Australian War Memorial for public display.</para>
<para>The coalition parties congratulate Trooper Donaldson on this great honour. It is a signal of his enormous bravery and courage in service to our nation. The Victoria Cross is not awarded lightly and it is important that we all really understand the significance of this honour, the first VC awarded in 40 years. The nation is very proud of Trooper Donaldson’s service and achievements, his distinguished service to the ADF since 2002 and his valiant actions under enemy fire in Afghanistan, and of all his comrades in Afghanistan. In his humility I am sure he would want us to acknowledge that there are many, many brave soldiers of ours serving in Afghanistan. So to Trooper Donaldson, his wife, Emma, and daughter, Kaylee, we record our sincere gratitude for your service and congratulate you on this most distinguished of honours.</para>

<para>—I concur with the remarks that have been made by Senator Evans and Senator Minchin. It is a very auspicious day. For the first time in approximately 40 years we have the awarding of a VC—the last one being Keith Payne, whom, I am very proud to say, signed my acceptance form to join the RSL. For valour, the whole concept of the VC is hard to explain to those outside or to those who have not had an involvement in the military. This means that, by tradition, he has to be recognised, even by Angus Houston, with a salute.</para>
</talk.start>
<para>Trooper Donaldson’s mother was a widow. He lived in the town of Dorrigo, although he was born at Waratah in Newcastle in 1979, I think. It goes to show that people of incredible calibre emanate from all sorts of beginnings. It is something that the whole nation can be proud of. Trooper Donaldson VC has now, as Senator Minchin rightly pointed out, joined the most distinguished and eminent group of people not only in Australia—there are only two left, Keith Payne and now Trooper Donaldson—but also throughout the world. Australia has only had, I believe, about 96 VCs awarded since the Boer War. It was made retrospective to cover the period of the Crimean War.</para>
<para>Trooper Donaldson really reflects the highest aspirations that people in Australia, regardless of their political allegiances, wish to imitate. When we are a nation made up of people of the calibre of Trooper Mark Gregor Donaldson then we are a nation that knows no limits and can attain all goals. With the utmost respect and the highest congratulations, I convey my thanks and my respect to Trooper Donaldson. I also acknowledge very much his wife, Emma, and his daughter, Kaylee, who make the continual sacrifice of having their husband and father go forward to protect our nation.</para>

<para>—Family First also congratulates Trooper Mark Donaldson on his receipt of the Victoria Cross. He is a hero and I am honoured to have the chance to congratulate him for his extreme bravery under the most difficult of conditions and at the risk of his own life. It is a great tragedy that there is such violence and so little peace in the world that we have to ask young Australians to serve their country in combat. But I think we reserve particular praise for members of our military forces not for killing our enemies, which is a terrible reality, but for risking their lives to save a mate. That is why Trooper Donaldson deserves the Senate’s special praise.</para>

<para>—The Australian people are right to expect the Prime Minister to deal with the economic circumstances we face in a statesmanlike and businesslike manner rather than engage in pseudo-intellectual babble as a veneer to cover for the fact that Labor has no real idea and no experience in how to handle our current situation. Labor is lurching from one stunt to the next with no plan for the future. Remember just 12 months ago Labor was condemning us for overheating the economy: inflation was out of control and we were overheating the economy. Indeed, we had been given 16 warnings, allegedly, by the Reserve Bank on this very issue. Today, 12 months later, is there any talk about the economy being overheated? Absolutely not. These economic incompetents opposite are now desperately trying to restimulate the economy. Having so turned down the economy, now they have to restimulate it. Their attack on us on that occasion failed and, can I tell you, circumstances will show that Mr Rudd’s latest attempt will also fail.</para>
</talk.start>
<para>The Australian people are right to feel deceived. The Australian people are right to feel let down. At the last election, courtesy of hundreds of thousands of dollars of schmick advertising gimmickry, Mr Rudd convinced Australians that he was an economic conservative—always has been, always will be. He believed in balanced budgets with no caveat about ‘over the economic cycle’. It was balanced budgets, full stop. And he said he believed in tax cuts: he was an economic conservative.</para>
<para>Those of us who read his first speech when he attacked that great British Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher’s economic policies and his quite bizarre speech on the GST knew he was not, had not been, nor would ever be, an economic conservative. We also knew that he did not understand economics. Indeed, his repudiation of the Hawke-Keating era and embracing of the Whitlam era shows his true colours and reaffirms his incapacity to grasp the economic imperatives from which social benefits can be derived.</para>
<para>Recently, Mr Rudd, assisted by anonymous others—and I do not blame them for wanting to remain anonymous—scribbled an avalanche of words about the global financial crisis, which is loosely called an ‘essay’. Its thesis, premise and content are undergraduate at best. His false construct of what he imagines neoliberalism to be does not hide his yearning for the old divisive class warfare mentality. His treatise, full as it is of false constructs and frenzied rewriting of history that would make even Stalin blush, and its breathtaking disregard for the actual facts provides no solutions, no remedies, no answers, just vitriol. In these times the Australian people do not want a Prime Minister engaging in petulant and frenzied scribbling as to how everything is somebody else’s fault. Instead of wasting his time confirming what an intellectual lightweight he is, the Prime Minister should have been developing policies that will boost productivity and position Australia for the future to take full advantage of the recovery which will surely come.</para>
<para>No amount of words—not even 7,700 of them—no amount of pseudointellectual babble will hide the fact that Mr Rudd’s response to date has been knee-jerk and reactive, with the short term in mind. The hard earned budget surplus has been splashed out like a quick sugar fix with nothing to show other than depleted coffers.</para>
<para>Mr Rudd’s scribbles use the word ‘crisis’ six times in just one sentence but provide not a single answer. He falsely states that neoliberalism is the cause of the current crisis and of course that the Liberal Party is the embodiment of that philosophy and all that is evil and wrong with the world. Yet only a year ago Mr Rudd was telling us and the Australian people that he was an economic conservative—not a neoliberal—just like Mr Howard and the Liberals. So, clearly, whatever neoliberalism is in Mr Rudd’s imagination, it is not the policy of the previous government—a policy which he adopted and said was his approach to economic management.</para>
<para>So whilst Mr Rudd was busily condemning the former government for what is no longer its economically conservative position—it is instead some imaginary neoliberalism—of too much financial deregulation, his deputy was overseas in Davos crowing about the sound regulatory framework introduced by—guess who?—those nasty neoliberals, those nasty economic conservatives Messrs Howard and Costello. Labor talk with a forked tongue on these issues. For cheap domestic political purposes Mr Rudd is willing to condemn us for not having enough bank regulation, but he then sends his deputy overseas to talk up the Australian financial framework as not only being good but being world leading. The Labor Party have to make up their minds as to how they want to attack us. First it was a matter of us letting the genie out of the bottle with inflation because we overheated the economy. Now the economy is collapsing and they have to reheat the economy. They are attacking us for deregulating too much, but then they say that it is something that the world should be following. So instead of this sort of divisiveness and the falsehoods that Mr Rudd is peddling in this essay, he should be listening to his deputy.</para>
<para>All the while, as this squabble goes on within the Labor Party and as this silly article is being digested, thousands of Australian jobs are being lost. And with jobs being lost, what is Mr Rudd saying? To the businesses of Australia he is saying, ‘Don’t sack anybody. You have a duty to keep people employed.’ Hello, what is he doing at the Australian Taxation Office, where 143 people have just lost their contracts? The efficiency dividend means that people are being put off in every Public Service department. So what he says is, ‘Do as I say, not as I do.’ Of course we need wage restraint, but not for his chief of staff! This is the sort of economic mishmash that this country has to put up with under the leadership—if I can loosely call it that—of Mr Rudd.</para>
<para>I just ask one question: can somebody remind me how a certain family made its huge wealth? It was off the back of job seekers in a deregulated labour market. If I recall, that might be a certain family. If they do it, it is wonderful and it is all part of the social democratic ethos, but if other people do it, it is evil greed and it is to be condemned.</para>
<para>Mr Rudd’s attacks in his essay have been all over the shop. I must say that it does not make much sense. It does not flow. What he seeks to suggest is that, somehow, keeping budgets in surplus was bad and that wave after wave of tax reductions was bad. But then I remind myself of what Labor’s policies were at the last election. Who introduced billions of dollars worth of tax cuts? It was none other than Mr Rudd. Who promised that he would ensure that the budget would always be balanced? There was no caveat about the economic cycle. It must have been that neoliberal Mr Rudd.</para>
<para>The man, at very best, is confused. This is a man who one day will tell you that he is an economic conservative and then a social democrat. In between those—somewhat and somewhere—he was also, I think, a Christian socialist. Each day he has got a different label, depending on the audience and what suits him. The simple fact is that the people of Australia do not want the Prime Minister to engage in these pseudointellectual exercises that highlight the fact that he is a lightweight in this area. They want him to sit down and manage the economy and ensure that Australian jobs are protected so that, ultimately, after all of these debt problems—private debt that is being replaced by public debt—we have an economy where the private sector can lead the recovery. That is what this country needs and that is the sort of leadership that Australia desperately needs Mr Rudd to provide.</para>

<para>—It is an interesting concept that now we are being asked to believe that the Liberal Party is in favour of untrammelled free markets and is against regulation of any sort. I presume that involves the Liberal Party only because on the economics committee the National Party, in the form of Senator Joyce, has been strenuously arguing for more regulation in the consumer sector in any case.</para>
</talk.start>
</continue>
<para>What I quoted is what was said by the Prime Minister. The Prime Minister wrote that this philosophy, in line with the Thatcher-Howard era, is anti tax, anti regulation and anti government intervention. Now I think we see very clearly, in what is happening in the world financial and economic markets, that this is a policy that was indeed doomed to failure. The Prime Minister indeed did say during the last election that he was an economic conservative, and I think those on the other side need it spelt out for them very clearly what this means. It means he believes in maintaining a budget surplus over the economic cycle and is committed to removing trade barriers and realising our free trade objectives. Indeed, this is also a platform policy position of our party and has long been so. What it does not mean, has never meant and never will mean, as far as the Labor Party is concerned, is that we would sit on our hands while the unemployment queues grow and Australians lose their homes, assets and savings, watching idly because we believe that the market will sort it out. I am absolutely bewildered as to what those opposite attribute the global financial crisis to if greed and unregulated financial markets are not a part of that. We then ask ourselves, given what the Liberal Party is now saying, ‘What would the Liberal Party have done in response to the global financial crisis?’</para>

<para>—We have to ask ourselves what the Liberal Party would have done. Which bits of the stimulus package or the current government’s response do they regard as radical or even simply non-conservative? Would it have been the guarantee that the savings people have in their banks are safe? Would the Liberal Party have not given that? The Liberal Party certainly did not reject that proposal at the time. Would they have not given extra assistance to pensioners at the end of last year, as part of that stimulus? In fact, at the time the opposition were stridently calling for extra assistance for pensioners and there are several instances of bonuses having been given to pensioners by the Howard government, so let us assume that that response would have received approval. Would they not have increased spending on vital infrastructure in conjunction with the states? Do the Liberal Party now reject that response by the Rudd government? Do they not now agree with the idea that we give assistance to those building commercial buildings to support jobs in that sector and to support that sector generally—because we do know as a fact that one of the problems under the Howard government is that there were a lack of tradespeople in the building sector that caused great bottlenecks in our economy. So what is the opposition’s position?</para>
</talk.start>
</continue>
<para>There was a quote in the Adelaide <inline font-style="italic">Advertiser</inline> of the Leader of the Opposition, Malcolm Turnbull, who said the problem was not going into deficit but how to get out of it later on. Its report said:</para>
<quote>
<para class="block">“I don’t think with these forecasts there’s any doubt that a deficit is inevitable, given the reduced tax revenues, but the one thing that is not inevitable is that a Labor Government will get out of a deficit,” he told reporters.</para>
</quote>
<para class="block">So our conservative Prime Minister seems well in tune with the conservative Leader of the Opposition, who has been saying that a deficit is inevitable and has asked how the Labor Party is going to get out of it. That is a fair question, and he has the response. He has the response given today by the Prime Minister, who said:</para>
<quote>
<para class="block">As the economy recovers, and grows above trend, the Government will take action to return the budget to surplus by:</para>
</quote>
<quote>
<list type="bullet">
<item>
<para>banking any increase in tax receipts associated with the economic recovery, while maintaining its commitment to keep tax as a share of the economy on average below the level it inherited; and</para>
</item>
<item>
<para>holding real spending growth to 2 per cent a year.</para>
</item>
</list>
</quote>
<para class="block">That is the very specific commitment by the Prime Minister and the Labor government to restoring over the economic cycle our surplus once the crisis in global financial circles is dealt with. There is an interesting quote from John Maynard Keynes, who said, ‘The difficulty lies not so much in developing new ideas as in escaping from old ones.’ I would suggest very strongly that is the position of the opposition as of now as they cannot escape from their old ideas even though the world has changed all around them. The world has changed greatly, which the opposition continue to reject. They continue to oppose anything that the government does without a coherent economic plan of their own.</para>
<para>Without a coherent response, without any constructive response of their own, they are content to sit back. We have the Leader of the Opposition, who was once a merchant banker, who has been immersed in the financial situation and who should, with his shadow Treasurer, accept that the world has changed. Now who is the shadow Treasurer? I think Ms Bishop is the shadow Treasurer, but we have not heard much from her at all. You would think that with that kind of expertise we might get some sort of constructive approach to the current global financial situation, but when it suits the opposition they ignore the fact that there is any kind of global economic downturn at all. On the other hand, when it suits them, they talk about the government’s poor response without producing anything that involves a response of their own.</para>
<para>So the question still is: what would the Liberal Party do? I am very proud to be part of the government that has proposed a response that improves infrastructure in Australia, improves education in Australia, improves training in Australia and puts forward an environmental package that ensures that any growth will be sustainable. I am very proud that the government, in response to the economic downturn, has put forward a package that looks very firmly to the future.</para>

<para>—I rise today to respond to Senator Abetz’s matter of public importance on whether the Prime Minister is actually a neoliberal or an economic conservative. I do not think there is any evidence to suggest that the government has moved away from neoliberalism, so I do not know what the debate is. It seems to me that it is only a matter of degrees. The Rudd government did go to the people with a very strong position and say, ‘We will not rock the boat in fiscal terms or change the way that the Howard government has managed the economy.’ People were out there asking, ‘Are you going to increase spending to public education?’ The government’s response seemed to be, ‘We’re not going to significantly change. We’re not going to discuss education policy; we’re going to lock in the funding to private education that the Howard government increased all those years—that’s going to stay the same.’</para>
</talk.start>
<para>When I moved a motion in this Senate to require those companies that identified energy efficiency opportunities to implement them—to require them to implement the opportunities that they identified—I recall Senator Evans stood up and said very clearly: ‘Regulation isn’t necessary. It should be voluntary. Everybody in this chamber agrees it should be voluntary. Companies should not be made to do the right thing. They will see that they need to do the right thing.’</para>
<para>I come back to education. There is a huge disappointment out there in the public education sector that we have a Minister for Education still talking about vouchers, still talking about giving people the option of going to private tutoring as opposed to putting more teachers in public education. There are a whole range of issues like that. At the moment we have talk about a green car in Australia at the same time as the government is saying we need to advance the free trade negotiation with Saudi Arabia so that we can put six-cylinder vehicles into the Middle East. Now where is the consistent philosophy there?</para>
<para>What we have with the rescue packages—we had $10 billion in December and $42 billion has been announced today—is $52 billion going into the Australian economy, but essentially there is no consistent philosophical base for that. It is a scattergun approach. Before Christmas it was: ‘Let me give you all those dollars. Go out and spend it.’ I remember the Minister for Finance and Deregulation saying: ‘Go and spend it on whitegoods. Go and buy washing machines and all the rest of it.’ This is at a time when we have a global crisis with climate change and with energy consumption and we need to restructure the economy. We are faced with peak oil prices and yet this was, ‘Here’s $10 billion, go out and spend it’!</para>
<para>Einstein said you cannot solve problems with the same mentality that created them and yet we had the Rudd government going out there saying, ‘The problem was greed, excess consumerism and unsustainable use, so here’s $10 billion to go out and do more of it.’ This was in order to keep people employed in the retail sector so that people could buy more things that they probably did not need in a lot of cases. I admit that a lot of people did save that money, and good on them if they did. But look at the casino turnover and the poker machine turnover in Tasmania. Last week I was shocked to see the figures on poker machines in Tasmania, where each poker machine earned more than the average wage in Tasmania. A lot of that money was just thrown in all sorts of directions but with no view to restructuring the Australian economy. There was no suggestion that the old system is broken and needs to be fixed. Now we have another $42 billion. I totally support the money being spent on infrastructure in schools. I am delighted to see that money is going to be spent on providing infrastructure in Australian schools. But it is not infrastructure alone that drives education. Where is the additional funding for public education in order that you would have the staffing of those schools? It is all very well to have new infrastructure, but what about the staffing? What is it that the schools are designed to deliver for Australian students? What sort of education system do we want?</para>
<para>We are hearing the idea that the government might have turned away from neoliberalism, but have I heard about the abolition of HECS? Have I heard about the abolition of fees for tertiary education? That would be a shift from neoliberalism to something different, but we have not heard that. Fees in universities are there to stay under the Labor government. They were introduced under a Labor government and maintained under the Howard government, which went even further with the full-fee-paying courses. While there has been some modification to that under the Rudd government, it is still a case of students having to pay fees for tertiary education. Then we heard floated the other day the idea of sending young people out to pay off their HECS by doing voluntary work in the community. That is effectively providing a subsidy, so you might as well pay people who are better qualified to do that work. If you want people to work in aged-care facilities, train them and pay them to work in aged-care facilities; do not just try to shift the burden to students in our community.</para>
<para>I do not see that the Rudd government has changed very much at all. The Rudd government was out there saying today that we have to get the Doha Round reorganised. That is what the minister said in question time. He said that we must get it back on track. Free trade is everything; unfettered free trade is still the philosophy of the Rudd government, just as it was the philosophy of the Howard government. It is all about undervaluing the Public Service and overvaluing the private sector with regard to the delivery of services. That is consistent across parties.</para>
<para>What we need is a new philosophy which recognises that the major crisis that we are facing now is that posed by climate change and peak oil. We have a financial collapse. The system is broken. This was an opportunity. We could have put $52 billion into restructuring the Australian economy in order to go to a low-carbon or zero-carbon economy and create jobs.</para>
<para>The one good thing about today’s package was in relation to energy efficiency. For the first time, the Rudd government has acknowledged that addressing climate change creates jobs. If you are going to make people’s homes more energy efficient, you have to employ people to go and do that. That stimulates business and jobs. But how much more would it do so if you retrofitted the whole country, as the Greens have been suggesting for some time, not only with insulation but with solar hot water? What if you used the money to drive the manufacturing sector in relation to renewable energy? What about investing in public transport—in public services—instead of the private car? Why can’t we see that we need a massive restructure and that we need a different way of viewing the world? That is not going to happen with this package.</para>
<para>I remain unconvinced that there has been any shift away from the neoliberalism that has dominated political thought in this country for the last 30 years. It is absolutely still there. There has been a lot of lost opportunity here. Half the package announced today is supposedly about supporting jobs. But effectively it is just a cash handout. There is an undirected cash handout across a whole range of sectors, giving people $950 here and $550 there to go and spend. This is about the Rudd government avoiding being seen to take Australia into a technical recession. It is not about restructuring the Australian economy for a low-carbon future and doing something that is consistent across the board—a whole-of-government approach—that would shift us from that old philosophical way of doing things, which celebrated greed and has not allowed for proper regulation particularly of the fat cats. Obscene salaries have been paid to corporate executives, and that is still the case in this country. I cannot see that Senator Abetz has anything to worry about. If he looks carefully, he will find that the Rudd government is in exactly the same fiscal conservative and neoliberal mode that their predecessor, the Howard government, was in.</para>

<para>—I am delighted to take part in this debate. I woke up on Saturday morning and looked at the <inline font-style="italic">Weekend Australian</inline> and thought, ‘Gee, overnight, Mr Rudd has announced the death of capitalism.’ I read a bit further and I thought that it got a little bit better because Mr Rudd said that he is going to fix it. Better still, he is going to refashion capitalism in his own image. That made me wonder, because I am no longer sure what Mr Rudd stands for. As my friend Senator Abetz has pointed out, he came to this place as a Christian socialist and used to cite Dietrich Bonhoeffer. He sometimes described himself as a social democrat. In more recent times leading up to the last election he described himself as an economic conservative.</para>

<para>—Senator Brandis is right. Mr Rudd said that he wore that badge with honour. He was a fiscal and economic conservative—so much so that he tried to outdo the coalition government. Leading up to the last election, Mr Rudd promised that he would rename the Department of Finance and Administration the Department of Finance and Deregulation. He was going to outdo the coalition; he was going to deregulate further. Then I read today in the Mr Rudd’s speech introducing the great stimulus package that this crisis was created by an ideology of unrestrained greed turbocharged by unregulated financial markets. And who was ‘Captain Zero’ leading up the last election? Mr Rudd. I wonder what the department will be called shortly. Will it become the Department of Finance, Reregulation and No Greed?</para>
</talk.start>
</continue>
<para>Let us have a bit of a look at the history of all this. I would like to give credit to the Labor Party. The Hawke and indeed Keating governments, after the Campbell report into the deregulation of the financial markets in 1982 at the end of the Fraser era, picked up the baton and deregulated the financial markets. And it was a good thing for this country. It was supported, I might add, by the opposition. That was a very good thing for this country. They lowered tariffs, which was also a good thing. I concede straight away that that was difficult, because many of their own interest groups fought against that.</para>
<para>Mr Hawke and Mr Keating led by example from the front—generally, I might add, without support. But they did the right thing. The fathers or godfathers of neoliberalism in this country are Mr Hawke and Mr Keating. That is a fact. I note that in this funny little essay, produced by friends of Mr Rudd and Mr Rudd, he talks about the ideological origins of the current crisis. The ideological origins of the current crisis in terms of Australian political ideology go back 25 years to the election of the Hawke government.</para>
<para>Hawke and Keating were not bad at it; they were good at it. But, of course, the Howard and Costello government was even better. In terms of economic growth and prosperity, it was the greatest government in our nation’s history. Let us face it: we inherited $96 billion worth of debt, paid that off and gave the incoming government $22 billion in surplus. We had the lowest unemployment for years and had 50 per cent growth in the economy in this country in the last 10 years. So-called neoliberalism was a stunning success. I would like to stress it. Mr Rudd, in introducing the economic stimulus package today, said:</para>
<quote>
<para class="block">We do not know for sure how long or deep the global recession will be. Because we acted responsibly to build a strong budget last year, Australia has an enviable budget position.</para>
</quote>
<para class="block">Australia has an enviable budget position because of Peter Costello and John Howard. That is the reason. If we had not been the government when it inherited $96 billion in deficit, this country would be in absolutely dire straits. Thank God for the previous government.</para>
<para>Let me just add this too. The Labor Party likes to talk a lot about social justice and helping people who are disadvantaged. There are many in Australia, and I accept that, but the most disadvantaged people in the world are in the developing countries of Africa and Asia. More people in the last 20 years have come out of poverty than at any other time in the course of human history. Hundreds of millions of people have come out of poverty. Do you know what the engine for this has been? The free market.</para>

<para>—The free market. The Chinese gave up communism and adopted the free market. Because they did, hundreds of millions of people have been rescued from poverty. It is probably the greatest thing the free market has done in the last 20 years. It has done great things in Australia and terrific things in much of Western Europe but particularly in the developing countries. And what has happened to those countries in Western Europe that did not adopt the dreaded neoliberalism? Countries like France have stagnated and have had 10 per cent unemployment for the last 25 years. The countries that have succeeded in the West have been the dreadful neoliberals that Mr Rudd now derides. We have never believed in untrammelled markets. That is why we have perhaps the best prudential regulations in the world. I heard what Senator Hurley said. That is not right. We have never said there should be no prudential regulations. In fact, as Ms Gillard said in Davos just the other day, we have the strongest and perhaps the best in the world.</para>

<para>—Introduced by Peter Costello. The question that Mr Rudd and his friends do not address is the really interesting point. It is that, since the Second World War, the democratic left in the West has developed no coherent ideology. They did have socialism, which was the nationalisation of the major means of production and exchange, and what happened? That failed. Tony Blair said it failed. Every leader in the democratic left said it failed. No-one adopted it. Ever since the failure of socialism, there has been no coherent ideology. We had the third wave developed by Mr Blair, but Mr Rudd now says that was cosying up too much to the marketplace; he is going to develop a new ideology. If you read that funny little essay, there are only two policy prescriptions. The first is getting more people to the table and consulting more widely—perhaps that is fair enough—and the other one is—guess what—spend, spend and spend. That is his main policy prescription; he has no other one. What concerns the coalition is where this will end. None of us doubt that there is a crisis. Indeed, the role of government now is to ameliorate the pain in the community. We all accept that. That is the role of government now. But to say that it has been a failure over the last 30 years defies logic. Mr Rudd is a hollow man.</para>

<para>—I am pleased to rise in this matter of public importance debate on the Prime Minister on the day when the federal government is putting in place one of the largest stimulus packages this country has ever witnessed. We need to address a global crisis so serious that it almost rivals the Great Depression, yet we are debating here in the chamber economic theory. It just goes to show the priorities of those on the opposite side of the chamber. This is a crisis taking place right now. Australians are losing jobs and Australian businesses are closing. Rather than come into the chamber with solutions and ideas, what do they provide and want to argue about? Economic theories. It shows the current state of the Liberal Party.

<para>—More Work Choices. We had Senator Abetz saying: ‘We should stay in the centre. We should not move to the left, we should not move to the right; we should stay in the centre.’ Of course, we had the shadow spokesperson for education saying, ‘We should move to the left.’ This is the current state of debate in the Liberal Party—not solutions or a plan to meet the economic crisis but a debate about ideology, a debate you cannot even get straight in your own party. I have never really been into theories. It is not something I have spent much time thinking about in my lifetime. I am more into practice and the way policies get implemented. The one thing I have observed in my time in the Senate and in my time in politics, when you talk about ideology, is that the opposite side are extreme. In terms of the marketplace, they are extremists; they are purists. Unlike Senator Mason, we actually do believe in the marketplace and we believe in capitalism, but we do not believe it should be unfettered.</para>
</talk.start>
</continue>
<para>There are some fantastic examples of how the Liberal Party operated in government and how they operate today. When you talk about what the Liberal Party truly stand for and about their ‘let the market rip’ and Gordon Gekko styles, there is no better icon than Work Choices, with the individual contracts or AWAs and workers losing conditions, penalty rates, redundancy and holiday pay. These are the policies of the Liberal Party and the policies of the National Party. This is the unfettered ‘let the market rip and bugger the consequences’ philosophy.</para>
<para>Let us look at the Liberal Party’s commitment to services and infrastructure. When countries around the world were investing in education, health and infrastructure, the Howard government was taking money out of those areas. The Howard government was stripping money from education, five per cent; stripping money from health, five per cent; and stripping money from infrastructure, 10 per cent. These are the policies of the Liberal Party, the policies of the ‘let the market rip’ conservatives. With child care we talk endlessly about the problems of ABC Learning. We do not talk too much about the policies of the other side of the chamber which allowed ABC Learning to operate without suitable regulation and to collapse, costing jobs and money and, in the end, putting the livelihoods of families and children at risk. Again, it was due to the policies of those on the other side of the chamber.</para>

<para>—This ideology is important today to how both sides of the chamber are approaching the economic crisis. We all know that this is a crisis that started in the United States with the subprime loans, CDOs and the market derivatives. We all know greed and market capitalism got out of control. There was inadequate regulation in the marketplace and inadequate regulation of public and private bodies, and the result was an economic crisis. As a result this banking liquidity crisis has now become much more serious. In the last three or four months we have seen a banking crisis become a global recession. For Australia things have also become much more serious. Six out of our 10 top trading partners are now in recession. China, our largest partner, making up 15 per cent of our exports, has issued data to show that its growth is going to be cut in half. Japan, our second largest trading partner, is now in recession and is talking about two years just to get out of recession.</para>
</talk.start>
</continue>
<para>Over the last two days the Treasurer and the Prime Minister have been outlining the effect that the global recession will have on our economy. One hundred and fifteen billion dollars has been taken out of government revenue and there is huge pressure on our budget. There are two ways governments can deal with a problem like this. On the opposition side of the chamber it is an easy solution. Do nothing and let the market sort the problem out. Let people suffer until it works its way through the system. Let the scavenger funds go out and pick up a cheap bargain, a cheap property or a portfolio, because that is how the market works.</para>
<para>That is not the Labor way. That is not what we believe in. We are going to intervene in the economy and intervene in the marketplace to ensure that the country has the stimulus it needs to create growth. Today’s $42 billion package is a commitment to taking the action that this country needs to support jobs. We talk a lot about economic figures and we debate theories in here, but in the end a global recession has a huge influence on the livelihoods of everyday Australians. People are going to lose their jobs, people are going to lose their homes and small businesses are going to close.</para>
<para>In relation to the package today I think it has gone down brilliantly. For what we can expect, do not listen to me; let us listen to the experts. Macquarie senior economist Brian Redican today said:</para>
<quote>
<para class="block">It’s much bigger than most people expected.</para>
<para class="block">It looks like they are bringing forward infrastructure spending to make it more timely and the fact they are forecasting big deficits for 2009/10 and 2010/11 means they are serious about doing all they can to support the economy.</para>
</quote>
<para class="block">Listen to ICAP senior economist Adam Carr:</para>
<quote>
<para class="block">It’s a pretty decent package. When you look at monetary and fiscal stimulus, one can only assume that inflation pressures are going to build through the economy and any talk of deflation is preposterous.</para>
<para class="block">The government has a very powerful influence over the economy. If they choose to spend such a large amount, it will provide employment, it will get money flowing through the economy and it will increase GDP.</para>

<para class="block">This is what the experts are saying and the same was said by the Commonwealth Bank.

<para>—I, like Senator Mason, woke up on Saturday morning, but I did not actually think we had seen the end of capitalism. I was somewhat more optimistic. I just thought that we had thrown out 25 years of this nation’s policy direction. But then I realised: no, it was only an article by the Prime Minister in the <inline font-style="italic">Monthly</inline>. I realised what this was. Just like it has been with all the state governments—to which Senator Arbib, amongst others, is most closely associated—the government needed someone to blame. It starts off with the state governments blaming their predecessors or the state governments blaming the Commonwealth. But this federal government could not do that. It had to find another purpose. So for the first six months of Labor being in office, we had the Treasurer acting as Major Nelson and, as I have said before, talking and dreaming about his genie. He realised after six months that the problem was that the genie was just a dream. Inflation was not the problem. As the former Treasurer and the Leader of the Opposition had outlined, we had much bigger problems on the horizon. Six months after everyone else realised it was going to be an issue, the Labor government woke up and realised that there was a global financial crisis. That is okay. Governments deal with challenges.</para>
</talk.start>
<para>On this side of the chamber, we came to office with a huge deficit. We had an Asian financial crisis, a collapse in the currency and a run on our neighbours’ currencies. We did not run around and do what this government is doing. For the first time ever, we have had a government running around talking down confidence. It ran around telling everyone how miserable their lives were going to be for the next two years. When we were in government, we told people the truth: ‘This is a very difficult period, but the government will help you through it. The government will take a long-term view and not a short-term politically expedient view.’ But just like its state counterparts, this Labor government is a leopard that does not change its spots. It simply says something so often that it makes it true. There are now three forms of truth in Australia: there is the truth, there is something that is not the truth, and then there is a Ruddism. A Ruddism is when you say something so often or when you make this action with your hands to make a point in front of a TV camera so often that everyone becomes so ‘on message’, due the great work of people like Senator Arbib, that you simply make it true.</para>

<para>—It is an aspirational truth, Senator Brandis. You are quite right. In the article in the <inline font-style="italic">Monthly</inline>, the government has embarked on a new sort of cult. I remember the movie <inline font-style="italic">Dead Poets Society</inline>. It was quite popular when I was young. This government has become the ‘Dead Economist Society’, with the heart paddles on Keynes in an effort to get him going again after the stagflation of the seventies, and there is also an attempt to raise the ghost of the late Hayek. The government is obsessed with battles of the past. But the problem we have now is that earning credibility in Fitzroy and attacking so-called neoliberalism is not a solution to any of the issues that we now face.</para>
</talk.start>
</continue>
<para>As has been outlined by previous speakers in the matter of public importance debate, the Prime Minister has claimed to be a Christian Democrat. He has claimed to be an economic conservative. He is now claiming to be a Social Democrat. If this were Germany, he would be a government of national unity on his own. If we compare what has happened over the last 20 years in places like Germany or western Europe, which have had those sorts of governments, with what has happened in Australia in that time, the answer is very clear: liberalism has succeeded in Australia. The facts speak for themselves. Where would you have rather been if you were a young person leaving school or university over the past 20 years? What country would you have rather been in to buy a house or start a business? No-one will answer Germany. No-one will answer France. They will say Australia, because it is the land of opportunity, and its economically liberal policies have provided people with the opportunity to make a start in life.</para>
<para>The Ruddism that the government is trying to put forward is that Liberals do not believe in the state. That is simply not true. We put the Australian Prudential Regulation Authority in place, as has already been outlined. The very reason our banking system is the most robust in the world is that we put in place the independence of the Reserve Bank over the opposition and threatened constitutional challenges of the Labor Party. We reformed the Trade Practices Act. We put in place the very measures that ensured the strength of Australia today. The key issue is not that the Liberals oppose regulation; we actually believe it is appropriate. The attack on neoliberalism by the Prime Minister is nothing more than a power grab by people who have been waiting 34 years to reregulate the economy, to reregulate people’s lives and to tell them what they can buy, when they can buy it, when they can go out, where they can drive and what they can do. That is exactly what this attack is; it is nothing more than a long-suppressed urge to control the lives of others—unlike what the economically liberal approach of the last 25 years has done.</para>
<para>I was watching <inline font-style="italic">Lateline</inline> last night and the person being interviewed said:</para>
<quote>
<para class="block">We have a floating exchange rate. The thing saving us through the Asian crisis was that we went down to 48c. When the terms of trade boom came to protect us from inflation it went up to 96. In less well times it went down to 64 or 65—in other words, it is completely flexible. The same with wages. We had a flexible labour market returning 4.5 per cent for wages for the last 15 years. That is the point. We are not opposed to that.</para>

<para class="block">That was the former Prime Minister Paul Keating, whom I am not often prone to quoting in this place. We are not going to do what the Labor Party did in opposition. We are not going to run away from our values, which put this country in very good stead and which left the current government with the strongest economy and the strongest budget position in the Western world. In 1996 those opposite ran away, and even today they are running away, from some of the few good things that the previous Labor government did.</para>
<para>What is neoliberalism? I was trying to think what it might be. Is it surplus budgets? It seems to be, because they are no longer present. I have learnt that the definition of ‘balance over the cycle’ is that Labor run deficits and we pay back the debt. Is it flexible labour markets? Yes, it is. Is it free trade? I like the fact that Australian workers do not have to pay in real terms three times as much for their shirts as they used to pay, because we no longer have tariffs. They can buy a car made in Japan or Europe—something that is not restricted to the wealthy in our society. They are not taxed or penalised for making a choice about where they want to spend their money.</para>
<para>What have the last 25 years delivered? They have delivered record economic growth and unprecedented prosperity for all of Australia. Until Saturday, that was the view of both sides of politics. We argued over many of the differences that we had, but we did not try and misrepresent what had happened. The Labor Party stands condemned for the article written by the Prime Minister. It stands condemned for trying to misrepresent what has been achieved in this country over the last 25 years, through the sacrifices of many.</para>

<para>—This matter of public importance debate is absolutely unbelievable. It demonstrates that the coalition are living in a time warp. I think the movie that influenced Senator Ryan was none other than <inline font-style="italic">Wall Street</inline>, with Gordon Gekko. At a time of economic of global economic crisis, the Liberal Party come in here with a time-warped defence of economic liberalism. At a time when governments around the world are actively intervening in the operation of the market in the interests of economic stability and the wellbeing of their country, Senator Abetz wants to engage in an ideological defence of the failed theories of neoliberalism.</para>
</talk.start>
<para>Senator Abetz and the Liberal Party are stricken by an ideological blindness that means they cannot accept that the theories that have underpinned the Howard government’s approach have failed. Senator Abetz must now accept that the grab bag of ideas that made up neoliberalism have led to the global economic meltdown and huge inequalities; they have led to poverty and to inefficiencies in our economy. Senator Abetz knows that the foundations of economic fundamentalism—the dogma that markets are self-correcting, that markets allocate resources efficiently and that markets serve the public interest to the exclusion of all else—has been exposed as no more than a theory that has been discredited by the historic developments of recent times.</para>
<para>I know it is hard for the Liberal Party to accept that Friedrich von Hayek, Milton Friedman, Margaret Thatcher, Ronald Reagan and John Howard were wrong to place the future of society in the hands of the market. We believe there must be a role for government. Multi millions of dollars have been spent by the neoliberals on think tanks, media blitzes and public relations exercises to convince the public that neoliberalism is the only way forward and that it is some natural condition for humankind. How wrong can you be when you see the very fundamentals of the international economy under unprecedented pressure? After three decades of neoliberalism, John Maynard Keynes is back in town—and he is back in town in every country in the world, including the United States. It is not surprising that the Nobel prize-winning economist Joseph Stiglitz said that ‘learning the lesson that neoliberalism is not supported by economic theory and not supported by historical experience may well be the silver lining in the cloud now hanging over the global economy’. This is the lesson that the Liberals have to learn.</para>
<para>It is clear that Senator Abetz and the Liberal Party have not learned the lessons that unfettered neoliberalism will destroy the economy. Malcolm Turnbull continues to dogmatically defend the market in the face of global evidence of the danger of allowing the market to operate in an unfettered and uncontrolled manner. Letting the market rip is a discredited, dangerous and unacceptable way forward. We will never adopt the approach that says there is no alternative. And we will never accept the neoliberal approach espoused by Thatcher:</para>

<para class="block">We will never ‘glory in inequality’. That is the reason the Australian public tossed you lot out on your ears. That is the reason that Work Choices became the epitome of inequality in this country. And that is the reason why you are here, belatedly and hopelessly, trying to defend neoliberalism. We will never glory in inequality, as you on the other side have done. We will make sure the markets operate in the interests of the Australian community. <inline font-style="italic">(Time expired)</inline>

<para class="block">The <inline font-style="italic">Airports Act 1996</inline> (‘the Airports Act’) and associated regulations provide a comprehensive regulatory regime to ensure orderly land use planning and development of the leased Commonwealth airports. The Airports Act requires the airport lessee companies prepare key planning documents such as master plans, major development plans and environmental management strategies. Airport lessee companies must provide a 60 business day public consultation period prior to lodgement of the plan/strategy with the Minister for Infrastructure, Transport, Local Government and Regional Development. This provides the community with the opportunity to scrutinise an airport’s planning intentions and proposed developments, including environmental and other impacts.</para>
<para class="block">Airport lessee companies must also advise in writing State, Territory and Local Government planning authorities of their intention to submit a draft major development plan to the Infrastructure Minister.

<para class="smalltableleft">The Government recognises that communities have an important role to play in protecting our national security and is committed to engaging the community on a range of national security matters. Considerable research has already been undertaken by Australian and overseas universities and think tanks on the causes of violent radicalisation. The Government is actively considering how best to take this forward in the Australian context. Several jurisdictions have already undertaken relevant studies and begun specifically targeted programs.</para>
<para class="smalltableleft">In addition, as an ongoing task, the Attorney-General’s Department (the Department) has undertaken considerable work to educate communities and create public awareness of the counter-terrorism laws. This has included the distribution of pamphlets in eight different languages spoken in Australia and has involved Departmental officers speaking at public forums. Future activities could involve extending the range of languages in which information pamphlets are produced (depending on community needs), preparing supplementary explanatory material where a significant change to the counter-terrorism laws is introduced and providing presentations to a range of community groups and stakeholders about impending key amendments to counter-terrorism legislation. In order to enhance the effectiveness of existing education and public awareness programs, attention will be directed towards extending counter-terrorism public information arrangements.</para>

<para class="smalltableleft">(d) paragraph 80.1(f) be amended to require knowledge of the existence of armed hostilities.</para>
</entry>
<entry margin-left="57">
<para class="smalltableleft">The Government supports in part recommendation 6. The Government supports sub-recommendation (a) in relation to providing an allegiance or duty requirement within the treason offence. Historically, it was always intended that the treason offence contain an allegiance element. Therefore, it is important that the provision expressly state this so it is clear that the presence of a betrayal of an allegiance or duty to the state is integral to the operation of the treason offence.</para>
<para class="smalltableleft">The Government supports sub-recommendation (c).</para>
<para class="smalltableleft">The offence already requires that assistance provided to the enemy be real or concrete and not mere rhetoric or expressions of dissent. Clarifying the conduct standard as one of ‘material assistance’ is reflective of how the offence is intended to operate. The ALRC made similar recommendations in its Report entitled Fighting Words: A Review of Sedition Laws in Australia (ALRC 104) (see recommendation 11-2)</para>
<para class="smalltableleft">The Government does not support sub-recommendations 6(b) and 6(d). In recommendation 6(b), the PJCIS recommends that the types of treasonable conduct set out in subsections 80.1(a)-(c) be separated. Implementation of the recommendation would not serve to improve the operation of the offence.</para>
<para class="smalltableleft">Recommendation 6(d) proposes amending the fault elements of the treason offence. This is not supported as it would confine the scope of the offence to those circumstances where the defendant knew about the existence of armed hostilities. The offence in section 80.1(f) currently requires that a person intentionally engage in conduct which is intended to assist an enemy (either country or organisation) which is engaged in armed hostilities against the Australian Defence Force. In proving that a person intended to assist the enemy, the prosecution would be required to prove that the defendant was aware that the ADF was engaged in armed hostilities against the enemy and provided assistance regardless. The defence of ‘good faith’ applies to the treason offence.</para>

<entry margin-left="57">
<para class="smalltableleft">The Government supports the alternative option in this recommendation to consult the States and Territories to give consideration to including psychological harm within the definition of terrorist act.</para>
<para class="smalltableleft">The general definition of harm in the Criminal Code includes harm to a person’s mental health, whether temporary or permanent. In order to ensure consistency within the Criminal Code, the notion of harm which applies to the definition of ‘terrorist act’ in section 100.1(2)(a) (being serious harm that is physical harm) could be expanded to include psychological harm. Psychological harm can be just as damaging as physical harm. Fear associated with the threat of terrorism or the implications associated with the commission of a terrorist act manifest beyond tangible physical harm.</para>

<para class="smalltableleft">The Government does not support recommendation 12.</para>
<para class="smalltableleft">Acts of terrorism may still occur during armed conflict; therefore the unqualified exclusion of armed conflict will encourage misapplication of the principles of public international law.

<para class="smalltableleft">The Government supports recommendation 13.</para>
<para class="smalltableleft">The Criminal Code currently contains offences for the commission of hoaxes that are made either via the post or a telecommunications network. However, if a terrorist-related hoax is committed without the use of the post or a telecommunications network, it will not be captured by the offence. Given the potential for a terrorist-related hoax to cause significant alarm to the community and to divert valuable law enforcement and emergency services, the creation of a terrorist-related hoax offence is warranted.</para>

<para class="smalltableleft">It has always been intended that the risk threshold associated with an organisation directly praising the doing of a terrorist act be real and apparent on the evidence presented and not fanciful or speculative.</para>
<para class="smalltableleft">Accordingly, the inclusion of the word ‘substantial’ would expressly confirm that the level of risk associated with advocacy is not mere risk but heightened risk.

<para class="smalltableleft">The Government does not support recommendation 17(a) as section 102.6(3) already provides that if funds are received for the sole purpose of funding legal representation, then the transaction does not fall within the ambit of the offence with the defendant bearing a</para>

<para class="smalltableleft">Further, the Government does not support recommendation 17(b). This legal burden requires the defendant to prove on the balance of probabilities that the funds were received solely for the purposes of legal representation. It is preferable that the defendant be required to prove the issue on the balance of probabilities as opposed to merely pointing to evidence which suggests that a reasonable possibility exists (evidential burden) because the evidence concerned will be readily available to the defendant but not the prosecution.</para>

The Government does not support recommendation 26(b) which is understood to be directed at applications for return of goods after they have been lawfully seized. The Government considers that where Customs have lawfully seized an item in an investigation after obtaining a warrant issued by a judicial officer (in which the applicant would have had the onus of establishing the necessity in all the circumstances of the seizure in question), a person whose items have been seized should be required to prove why those seized items should be returned to them.</para>

The ‘six ASIO criteria’ were initially referred to by the former Director-General of ASIO, at a hearing on 1 February 2005 during the PJCIS’ review of the listing of six terrorist organisations.

</para>
<para class="block">The Australian Government welcomes the report of the Senate Standing Committee on Finance and Public Administration into the Lobbying Code of Conduct ‘Knock, knock... who’s there? The Lobbying Code of Conduct’.</para>
<para class="block">The Lobbying Code of Conduct (the Code) was adopted by the Government in May 2008 to promote trust in the integrity of government processes and ensure that contacts between lobbyists and Australian Government representatives are conducted in accordance with public expectations of transparency, integrity and honesty.</para>
<para class="block">In adopting the Code, the Government recognised that lobbying is a legitimate activity and part of the democratic process. However, there was a concern that Government representatives who are the target of lobbying activities are not always fully informed as to the identity of the people who have engaged a lobbyist to speak on their behalf. The Government considered that this information can be fundamental to the integrity of its decisions and should be freely available to those who are lobbied and to the wider public.</para>

<inline font-weight="bold">Recommendation 1</inline>

<para class="block">
<inline font-weight="bold">Response</inline>
</para>
<para class="block">The Government does not support Recommendation 1 of the Minority Report.</para>
<para class="block">The Government considers it is entirely appropriate that the Minister responsible for the Code, the Cabinet Secretary, have absolute discretion under the Code to direct the Secretary of the Department of the Prime Minister and Cabinet not to register a lobbyist or individual, or to remove a lobbyist or individual from the Register.</para>
<para class="block">The Government expects that this power would be exercised rarely and only after affording natural justice to the individual or individuals concerned as is required under clause 10.5 of the Code. The Government notes that, to date, no lobbyist has been refused registration or removed from the Register at the direction of the Cabinet Secretary.</para>
<para class="block">
<inline font-weight="bold">Recommendation 2</inline>

<para class="block">The Lobbying Code of Conduct has been established by Executive decision and any decisions made under the Code are not subject to appeal to the Administrative Appeals Tribunal (AAT).</para>

<para class="block">The Government does not support Recommendation 3 of the Minority Report.</para>
<para class="block">The purpose of the Register of Lobbyists is to allow Ministers and officials to establish whose interests a lobbyist represents when they seek to influence Government officials.</para>

</para>
<para class="block">That post-employment restrictions on MOPS staff be removed from the Code.</para>
<para class="block">
<inline font-weight="bold">Response</inline>
</para>
<para class="block">The Government does not support Recommendation 4 of the Minority Report. Clause 7 of the Code provides that persons who were, after 1 July 2008, employed in the Offices of Ministers or Parliamentary Secretaries under the Members of Parliament (Staff) Act 1984 (the MOP(S) Act) at Adviser level and above, as well as senior public servants and senior members of the Australian Defence Force, are prohibited, for a period of 12 months after they cease their employment, from engaging in lobbying activities, as a third-party lobbyist, relating to any matter that they had official dealings with in their last 12 months of employment. This is consistent with the policy underpinning the Code: that Ministers and other Government representatives have a right to know who stands to benefit from lobbying activities.</para>
<para class="block">The Code therefore does not restrict former senior ministerial staff members from lobbying on behalf of companies that employ them after they cease their employment. However, it does impose a temporary restriction on their ability to work as third-party lobbyists on behalf of clients who operate in an area in relation to which they had official dealings in their last 12 months as a member of staff.</para>
<para class="block">Former Ministers (and Parliamentary Secretaries) are subject to greater restrictions under the Standards of Ministerial Ethics. Ministers and Parliamentary Secretaries are required to undertake that, for a period of 18 months after ceasing to be a Minister, they will not lobby, advocate or have business meetings with members of the Government, public service or Defence Force on any matter that they had official dealings as a Minister in their last 18 months in office. This restricts a former Minister or Parliamentary Secretary from lobbying Government representatives during the specified period, even in an in-house capacity.</para>

They have been designed to provide further information about the application of the Code.</para>
<para class="block">However, to avoid any ambiguity or potential misunderstanding a preamble has been added to the Q&amp;As page on the Lobbyists Register website confirming that the Q&amp;As do not form part of the Code, but have been designed to provide guidance on the Code and the operation of the Register.</para>

</motion>
<para class="block">The Senate Legal and Constitutional Affairs Committee report entitled <inline font-style="italic">Effectiveness of the Sex Discrimination Act 1984 in eliminating discrimination and promoting gender equality</inline> was tabled out of session just before Christmas. I want to make a few comments on this report, noting in particular that there was a chair’s report and there was a Liberal senators’ report. At first instance I want to thank the committee secretariat for their assistance and professionalism in preparing the report. It was challenging to pull the report together in the time available. There were some time pressures. It is a substantial report. It was a big effort to have it done in the time allotted. I thank them.</para>
<para>The other Liberal senators who joined me in presenting the Liberal senators’ report include Senator Mary Jo Fisher, Senator Russell Trood and participating member Senator Helen Kroger. The chair was Labor senator Trish Crossin. I think it is important to note the Liberal senators’ report here in the Senate. We do support the administrative and technical amendments that are set out in our report and indeed the majority of the recommendations to improve the operation of such legislation. It was timely to review the Sex Discrimination Act. As a result of the inquiry’s work, some of those recommendations have been implemented.</para>
<para>The inquiry was limited in terms of time and in terms of the evidence that provided the foundation for the chair’s report, or the majority report, and its recommendations. We certainly were not convinced that the inquiry process was sufficiently rigorous. The chair’s report is very extensive in its ambit and does give rise to considerable concern, particularly if you look at the recommendations. In our view the committee did not hear from a sufficiently broad range of religious or educational organisations, which stand to be significantly affected if the recommendations in the chair’s report are translated into legislation. That is one of the reasons I am raising the concerns here today in the Senate.</para>
<para>In terms of Australia’s position, the act has I believe helped reduce discrimination against women. There is evidence of that in our report on page 168. In international comparisons Australia has an enviable record in relation to gender equality. Interestingly, the UN Development Program’s gender-related development index ranked Australia second in 2007-08. The index measures the extent to which countries are delivering equality for men and women by looking at factors including education enrolment, income and life expectancy.</para>
<para>We made a number of comments in our report regarding measures to redress the gender imbalance in teaching. They are set out on page 169. We are concerned by the evidence that some educational outcomes for boys are lagging behind outcomes for girls and consider that redressing the imbalance between male and female teachers is a key means of improving the outcomes for boys. At the moment the act prohibits targeted initiatives aimed at increasing the number of male teachers on the basis that that discriminates against women. This is a retrograde and disappointing situation to be in. Liberal senators noted the view expressed by Jim Wallace of the Australian Christian Lobby that the act should not prevent common-sense approaches to addressing the shortage of male teachers. We also noted the submission made by Family Voice Australia that the act should be amended as proposed by the coalition some years ago with the Sex Discrimination Amendment (Teaching Profession) Bill 2004.</para>
<para>We have made observations regarding access to assisted reproductive technology, surrogacy and adoption. We have made some very strong comments in regard to exemptions, and they are that they should remain. The passage of the legislation at the time involved a prolonged period of negotiation regarding appropriate exemptions from the prohibitions on discrimination under the act and those negotiations involved a complex balancing of different rights and interests.</para>
<para>I want to make an observation with respect to voluntary organisations. The majority report proposed the removal of section 39, which creates an exemption for voluntary organisations. This is something that we Liberal senators do not support. We think volunteer organisations provide an invaluable service to our community. They should be supported in every way, shape and form. They are undervalued and they deserve respect and support in every way possible. It would be disappointing to impose what some people might say are significance compliance costs on such organisations that would only lessen their ability to sustain their contribution. There was no evidence to the committee in our view that discrimination by voluntary organisations in relation to membership is a widespread problem. Rather, the arguments for removal of this exemption rested almost entirely on an ideological objection to the provision and the theoretical possibility of such discrimination occurring.</para>
<para>Liberal senators want to make very clear our view that we support maintaining an exemption for those with combat duties in the armed services and for sporting organisations. We disagree with the view expressed by the government senators that there were strong arguments for the removal of such exemptions with respect to certain religious institutions. Liberal senators recognise the importance of retaining appropriate exemptions for religious organisations. Freedom of religion is a fundamental human right and any restriction on freedom of religion should be limited to what is required to achieve a legitimate public purpose. The government senators make it clear in their report that there should be a review. They are interested in a review in that regard. We made our position clear that we support an exemption for religious organisations and that that should be maintained and that it should also be maintained for those with combat responsibilities and those involved in sporting organisations.</para>
<para>We do not support signing up to the optional protocol to CEDAW, the Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination against Women. We believe, in short, that Australian law should be decided in Australia by Australians under our jurisdiction and that there are appropriate mechanisms for dealing with all forms of discrimination against women. You do not need to accede to that optional protocol and become beholden, at least to some degree, to a UN committee, which is in my view unrepresentative and certainly not democratic in its form. This is consistent with the Liberal senators’ dissenting report of the Joint Standing Committee on Treaties which opposes the accession to the optional protocol to CEDAW. Of course, there are different views on these matters, but this is certainly the view of the opposition senators in that report.</para>
<para>The government announced after the tabling of the joint standing committee report that it has commenced the process required to accede to the optional protocol. That is disappointing. I feel an accession to that particular protocol is giving up rights and responsibilities which should be meted out here by Australians in our jurisdiction and in our courts. We have adequate judiciary and judicial mechanisms to ensure that can occur. There was no evidence received by the inquiry to justify providing an overarching level of appeal to an unaccountable UN body. On the contrary, it is clear that the avenues available under the Commonwealth, state and territory laws for hearing and determining complaints of sex discrimination are more than adequate.</para>
<para>In conclusion, yes, we do support a number of administrative and technical measures to improve the operation of the bill and we hope that the government will respond to those recommendations. If the government does proceed along the lines of some of the far-reaching recommendations in the majority report or the Labor senators’ report, then no doubt those legislative mechanisms will be forwarded to the Senate and they will no doubt be of concern to many people in the Australian community.</para>

</motion>
<para class="block">I rise today to take note of the government response to a resolution of the Senate pertaining to the proposal by Forestry Tasmania to build a road in the Tarkine wilderness. The motion was moved by my colleague, Senator Bob Brown, and it read:</para>
<motion>
<para>That the Senate—</para>
<list type="unadorned">

<para>notes local government and community opposition to a road, proposed by Forestry Tasmania, through a section of the Tarkine forest; and</para>

</item>
</list>
</item>
</list>
</motion>
<para class="block">The Greens are pleased that the Minister for Infrastructure, Transport, Regional Development and Local Government, the Hon. Anthony Albanese, has now responded, pointing out that the Tasmanian government is responsible for providing funding to Forestry Tasmania for forestry roads, including any proposed roads within the Tarkine forest and that the Australian government is not providing funding for any roads within the Tarkine forest. I acknowledge the minister’s response and thank the federal government for recognising that it would be a complete waste of taxpayers’ money for the federal government to inject money into a road for which there is zero stakeholder support. Nobody in the local area supports this road. In fact, the Cradle Coast area reject the road and it is Forestry Tasmania and the Tasmanian government that are pushing it.</para>
<para>You have to ask yourself: why is it that Forestry Tasmania is so desperate to push a so-called tourism road into the Tarkine wilderness? What a surprise that Forestry Tasmania’s proposed road would go past its dismal swamp tourism venture—which I have to tell the Senate is losing money hand over fist. What a try-on to get more money out of governments to seal a road past a supposed tourism asset which is going broke and, furthermore, would allow sealed access to logging coops. What a surprise that it would be seeking tourism money to seal a road to give better access to logging coops. I am glad that the federal government has recognised this is yet another try-on from Forestry Tasmania to secure yet more subsidies to prop up its completely unsustainable operations.</para>
<para>It is particularly relevant at the moment with the global economic crisis that Forestry Tasmania is basically allowing Gunns to access Tasmania’s forests at very little return to the Tasmanian taxpayer. I would certainly be appreciative if the federal government could have a better look at what is going on because the global price of native forest woodchips has collapsed, as predicted, as a result of the global financial crisis. Forestry Tasmania did a deal with Gunns—a forestry agreement—that said that the price that it pays for woodchips would be directly relative to the export price and that it will go down accordingly. So all the risk is born by the Tasmanian taxpayer and Forestry Tasmania and not by the company. Where else in the world do you get deals where, as a private corporation, your profits are guaranteed and the state loses money?</para>
<para>We have virtually got to the point where Tasmania is getting nothing for the logging industry taking away our forests. Now that there is no market for export woodchips, what a surprise that Forestry Tasmania is rushing out and wanting to turn them into so-called renewable energy, which of course it is not, by burning the native forests. Gunns is proposing to have a native forest burning furnace at their pulp mill, and no doubt it will be rushing in to try to convert it to biochar. So the whole thing will be, ‘We have to keep logging those forests and we’ll come up with any reason at all to try to keep logging them,’ when in fact there is a huge potential to save those forests as the green carbon stores that they are and actually market them to the tourism industry. Tourists want to come and look at standing forests, not fight with forestry trucks on their backs on Tasmania’s roads as the log trucks generate more and more accidents in Tasmania.</para>
<para>We have had yet more accidents over the summer. We have so many log trucks on the roads and we have tourism vehicles on the roads, and with the state of the roads there is the inevitability of accidents because many of the roads are way too narrow to be able to accommodate the scale of the log trucks. You only had to see the queue of log trucks in Tasmania when young people managed to highlight the fact that so many of our carbon stores are going through the woodchipper for export to Japan. There was a queue of log trucks as far as the eye could see. The plant at Triabunna was shut down for only about 40 minutes. That gave people a sense of just how many of Tasmania’s forests are being logged unsustainably, with virtually no return to the taxpayer. There is a huge loss of carbon to the atmosphere and a huge loss of our carbon stores and biodiversity. To think that they would dress up what is effectively yet another logging road as some sort of tourism operation is a joke.</para>
<para>The Bartlett government, the Labor government in Tasmania, is supporting this road—what a surprise—but it is on hold now because the Tasmanian government is also under the hammer because of the financial crisis. The road is on hold, but it should never be supported. The community does not support it. It certainly wants to have more tourism facilities in the Tarkine. That is exactly what the Greens support: to have the area saved and see the 447,000 hectares of wilderness actually protected and given World Heritage status. It is the largest temperate rainforest in the Southern Hemisphere. It has more than 60 species listed as rare, threatened and endangered. It has a huge diversity of landscapes and rich Indigenous and European cultural heritage.</para>
<para>Conservationists and tourism operators are working towards full protection of the Tarkine and a well-resourced Parks and Wildlife Service to be able to manage the area. All of them want a well thought out conservation and tourism strategy. Nobody except Forestry Tasmania, the logging industry and the Bartlett government wants to see more roads pushed through rainforest. It is an outrageous proposition. It will lead to yet more road kill at night and loss of biodiversity. The area is already under great threat because Forestry Tasmania is using taxpayers’ money to fund that logging operation. It is also seeking, as I just indicated, to coopt taxpayers’ tourism money for the Tarkine region for a road through pristine rainforests in the heart of the area. That road will open up the Tarkine to weeds, pests, diseases and greater risk of arson and wildfire.</para>
<para>I would remind the Senate that it was only last year that an off-road vehicle user lit a fire in the Tarkine that wiped out 30,000 hectares of the area, including a precious stand of Huon pines. Because the rules of arson relate to loss of property and the fact that native forest is not regarded as property having any value, there is virtually no penalty for arsonists. At the time they built that Tarkine road, we said very clearly—and I was one of the people arrested there—that this would give access to arsonists and illegal logging of the Tarkine. The road to nowhere was a stupid idea and it remains a stupid idea. To make matters worse, to build yet another road—a link road, a loop road—for forestry at the cost of $23 million would have been an abuse of taxpayers’ money. So I am delighted that the minister has said that no federal funding will go to Forestry Tasmania’s stupid link road to try and prop up its dismal swamp operations and to give sealed road access to its logging coops.</para>
<para>I congratulate the federal government, but I would like the federal government to reopen discussion about Tasmania’s forests. We are seeing the precious forests of the Florentine being logged and having a road pushed in there. It is a tragedy. We need to see the regional forest agreements overthrown and, instead, our precious native forests valued for their biodiversity and the carbon stores that they represent. That will be worth so much more financially, in terms of the climate, our quality of life and biodiversity in the future than any amount of woodchips shipped out to Japan.</para>

<para>—by leave—I move:</para>

<motion>
<para>That the Senate take note of the document.</para>
</motion>
<para class="block">I want to pass on a very hearty ‘congratulations’ to the Australian Sports Commission for their leadership in promoting healthy and active lifestyles in Australia, particularly for young Australians. In doing so, I note that this particular policy of the Active After-school Communities program was launched by the Howard government at a healthy lifestyle forum which I organised in Launceston in June 2004, where the Prime Minister, together with the then sports minister, Senator Rod Kemp—a very fine senator and a wonderful advocate for healthy lifestyles and the sports community—announced the funding package and the initiative, the Active After-school Communities program.</para>
<para>It is a fantastic program and it works. It ensures that children—Australian boys and girls across the country—have an opportunity to be more physically active doing things that they enjoy. It is not at all one-dimensional; they can play different types of sports. I just think it is tremendous. It is organised by the Australian Sports Commission. It is using government owned facilities and educational institutions otherwise left vacant during this time after school. It usually runs from about 3.30, I think, until five or thereabouts, and it uses those facilities.</para>
<para>It is a great idea. At this stage there is an estimated 150,000 children that are benefiting from this particular program. Initially it kicked off with $90 million in funding over three years to establish the Active After-school Communities program in over 3,000 primary schools and out-of-school-hours care services. As I said, that was for 150,000 children.</para>
<para>I also want to acknowledge the wonderful work of the volunteers—those mums and dads that are out there saying, ‘Look, I’ll give up my time and my resources to say: “Yes, this is a good program.” I’m going to help the Australian Sports Commission and their representatives’—whether they be in Tasmania or any state or territory across the country. I want to say thank you to the volunteers, because their volunteering should be recognised for what it does. They help make this program a success.</para>
<para>Of course, the program is designed to address the very serious obesity epidemic—not just in children but across the population. I will say more about that shortly. The then senator Rod Kemp gave a presentation at the time of the launch and his speech is included in a book that I released 18 months ago called <inline font-style="italic">The Millennium disease: responses to Australia’s obesity epidemic.</inline> At page 23 Senator Rod Kemp outlined the philosophy behind the importance of an Active After-school Communities program and also some of the details of that policy initiative that was announced by Mr Howard and him in Launceston in June 2004.</para>
<para>In the Active After-school Communities program performance survey it was found at that time that 88 per cent of parents said that their children were previously inactive. It is fantastic. Isn’t it great to think that so many young children were inactive and are now active in those programs? The report also revealed that 81 per cent of children surveyed said they had fun; 75 per cent said they wanted to continue in the program; 89 per cent of school centres and deliverers believed that fundamental motor skills were being improved; 76 per cent of deliverers said that the program was stimulating local community involvement in sport and physical activity, and 88 per cent of school centres were satisfied with the program’s performance. Well, that is a very good survey result, in anybody’s book. Those are 70- to 80-plus per cent responses. Yes, that was some time ago, and I have not seen the latest figures, but I would imagine they would be similar. Those sorts of percentages and high satisfaction rates are very rewarding indeed, and encouraging for all of us.</para>
<para>The Auditor-General’s report sets that out and notes that in 2007-08 there were a total number of 150,000 participating children, the total number of participating sites was 3,250, and the total funding in that year was $43.1 million, with a total of $121.4 million over the four-year period from 2004-05, when it was first launched. The Auditor-General’s report also notes that it is continuing into the future. I just hope that the program will continue, and that it will continue to be a success. I am sure that if it is operated by the Australian Sports Commission it will be. I want to commend all those involved in the Australian Sports Commission, particularly in Tasmania—Ralph Morris and his colleagues. They are a wonderful group of people. They get on well with the families and the schools involved. The Campbell Town program, I know, has been particularly rewarding for the local community.</para>
<para>The program is definitely designed to address the obesity epidemic. It is very serious when you have one in five children in Australia that are overweight and one in 10 that are obese. It is a very serious issue, and we saw the news flash, just a few days ago, where there were recommendations for children that are morbidly obese to be removed from their families, as a last resort. I think all options should be on the table with respect to how we look after our young Australians. We have a duty of care, as members of parliament—federal and state members in particular—and we need to ensure that their best interests are protected.</para>
<para>Let us be clear about this: obesity leads to type 2 diabetes, it leads to cancer, it leads to heart conditions and it leads to a whole range of other health conditions. Obesity will certainly lead to early death, so this is very serious. And that is why this sort of initiative should be supported 100 per cent across the board, by all sides of parliament, to ensure that our children get the best possible start in life so that they can reach their full potential.</para>
<para>One thing I am concerned about is that the federal Labor government, with much fanfare, made obesity a national health priority. We all thought: ‘Well, this is good. They’re going to back that up with action, with strong decisive initiatives to help implement the policy that must be properly addressed.’ Here you have the big-picture, flashy PR, headline stuff: obesity a national health priority. But what has happened? They have been in government over 14 months—nearly 15 months—and very little has happened. In fact, no major initiatives have occurred with respect to addressing the obesity epidemic. This is something that should be noted by all members of the Senate and by members of the public. We need action.</para>
<para>I commend the obesity prevention task force, Professor Rob Moodie, Professor Paul Zimmet and their colleagues. They are doing a good job taking on advice and consulting around the country—but we need action by government. You cannot just say that it is a national health priority and then sit back and do nothing. We are not going to stand for that. It is not right. The interests of Australian children need to be protected and supported. They need to be encouraged to live healthy, active lifestyles. You cannot just say that obesity is a national health priority and then do nothing. It is not on. They are having further consultations, devising further strategies and taking advice—but it has been 14 months. I call on the Minister for Health and Ageing, Nicola Roxon, to act and to implement the much needed action with respect to addressing the obesity epidemic.</para>
<para>In conclusion, the Active After-school Communities program is an excellent one. It has been commended in the 2008-09 Auditor-General’s report. I commend it to the Senate. I commend it to the public. I know it provides good outcomes for young, healthy Australians.</para>

<para class="block">Just to remind the Senate, what we are doing here is supporting the intent of the legislation that the government has put before the Senate. These amendments are intended to restore the ability of individuals to claim tax deductions for donations up to a certain threshold made to political parties. As foreshadowed, we believe that any form of participation by people in Australia’s democratic process should be encouraged. This is, indeed, a public good. While we certainly support the intention of the government to strip tax deductibility entitlements from corporations and other entities, we believe that people should retain these rights. That is what these amendments are designed to accomplish.</para>

<para>—I indicate my support for these amendments and reiterate my position: I supported the second reading of this bill on the basis that I could support these amendments of the Australian Greens. I think it is appropriate that there still be a tax deduction for donations made by individuals—not corporations—up to $1,500 for all the reasons I set out in my second reading contribution but principally because it allows individuals to be part of the political process and because to get rid of the tax deduction all together would, I think, unfairly disadvantage smaller parties and Independents. With respect to the Labor Party, I think that the government’s bill would also give an inherent advantage to the Labor Party, regarding contributions made by the union movement direct to the ALP, in the sense that there would still be tax deductibility for union contributions, which would indirectly find their way to the ALP. I think this approach of the Greens is an appropriate one. I do not think it is appropriate for corporations to obtain a deduction. I think this is an improvement on the status quo.</para>

<para>—As honourable senators will be aware, our strong view has been that this bill should never have come before this chamber and that this bill should have been pulled, pending comprehensive campaign finance reform discussions. This amendment bill is of the government’s own making, quite frankly, and the government must wear the outcome of it. It had the opportunity to make this bill part of the campaign finance reform agenda. I indicate that the coalition will be supporting the Greens amendments for a number of reasons.</para>
</talk.start>
<para>The minority report on the initial bill in relation to this matter, the Tax Laws Amendment (2008 Measures No. 1) Bill 2008, quite clearly showed—as quite eloquently referred to by my colleagues Senators Birmingham and Ryan—that Treasury could not actually indicate what the savings were going to be in relation to this matter. It was a hotchpotch from the start. It was never, ever designed as campaign finance reform, as I indicated earlier.</para>
<para>The Labor Party refuse to acknowledge that, under their proposals, were this bill to go through, they would retain quite an extraordinary advantage, to the detriment of all the non-government parties. That, clearly, has been recognised by us and it has been recognised by the Greens. I again refer to the Joint Standing Committee on Electoral Matters, JSCEM, discussion, when the committee had to decide whether it would indeed deal with this bill. Senator Bob Brown voted with the coalition for the committee not to deal with it. It should be part of comprehensive campaign finance reform discussions. The Labor Party committee chair, with a casting vote, refused to make it so. So the outcome for the Labor Party today, as I said before, is entirely of its own making, and it must wear it.</para>
<para>The reality is that, as has been indicated by a number of speakers today, it is totally inappropriate for the Australian Labor Party to get very, very large donations—in fact, $36 million, as shown by the AEC yesterday—via union subscriptions which are tax deductions in the hand of the person who paid the subscription. Of course, that is then passed on to the Australian Labor Party. This bill seeks to give one treatment to people sending subscriptions to a union—and then back to the Australian Labor Party—but someone who wants to participate in the political process because they are passionate about it, who does not send this money back via a union subscription, is not able to get a tax deduction. That is totally inequitable. It is self-serving and it is only designed to continue an advantage.</para>
<para>The Labor Party stands condemned for that in this day and age, when we are seeing a diminution of community involvement in political parties and voluntary organisations, as I am sure honourable senators both younger and older than me will be aware. Because of the pressure on people’s time, they are no longer involved. This was one way for the average Australian who did want to participate in the political process, at a very low level of donation, in the main, to have the same advantage of tax deductibility as those who were donating via other methods such as subscriptions to unions and other organisations.</para>
<para>Our preference would have been for this bill to have been taken out and made part of campaign finance reform, but we have been swayed by the Greens argument that now is an appropriate time to bring these amendments in. We have thought long and hard about this, given our approach to this bill over many, many months. We have reflected on it, and the fact that it is a chance for all—or maybe all; I am not too sure what others, apart from the Greens and Senator Xenophon, are doing—to protect, one would hope, forever the right of individuals to make a small contribution to a political party or an individual within the system which is tax deductible. It is the same opportunity given to their next-door neighbour who might be putting in a donation by way of a union subscription or another method. So, having given this due consideration, we will be supporting the Greens amendments.</para>

<para>—I would just like to acknowledge the support of the coalition and Senator Xenophon for these amendments and, by way of that acknowledgement, add our voices to the fact that this is indeed very much the beginning of this process, not the end. It would have been better to have had these amendments going through the chamber tonight as part of a more integrated package that had been thought through very carefully, because this is crucial as it governs not only the way that we in here behave but also the process of democracy in this country. These amendments are a sensible measure that will get us a certain way down the track tonight, but we look forward to being part of the debate on the broader issues of campaign finance reform and electoral reform in Australia. I thank other senators for their support for these amendments.</para>

<para>—The government does not support these amendments. The government’s election commitment to remove tax deductibility for political donations is reflected in the bill as it stands. Amending the bill to allow deductibility for individuals’ donations would significantly diminish the savings in this measure and create an inconsistency between individual and business donations which is not justified. The government does not believe that it is appropriate to allow tax deductions for individuals and businesses who make political donations and, as a result, cannot agree to the amendments.</para>

<para>—This is all a bit strange, isn’t it? Here we are, talking about treating political parties like charities. Giving a tax break for donations to political parties is a rort. Two-and-a-half years ago Family First moved an amendment in the Senate to abolish tax deductibility status for political parties and here we are today—we have Labor saying, ‘We don’t like tax deductibility for individuals but we do want it for our unions.’ You cannot have it both ways. At least the Liberals are consistent on this one. I do not know where the Greens are coming from, but, frankly, treating political parties like charities is an insult to charities. Giving a tax break for donations to political parties is just outrageous when you think about it. So, no, we do not support this amendment. It is sending all the wrong signals to Australians—that you can get a tax break by donating to political parties. It is treating us politicians like charities, and we are not charities. Political parties are self-interested and they should not be treated like charities. So Family First will not be supporting these amendments.</para>

</amendment>
</amendments>
<para class="block">This puts a limit on election funding to a maximum of $10 million, which will mean that the amount any political party can receive back from taxpayers is capped at $10 million. To try to put this in simple terms, at the last federal election the ALP got $22 million from taxpayers. The Liberal Party got $18 million of taxpayers’ money. That is a heck of a lot of money. Taxpayers were getting excessive television campaigns and mail in letterboxes and they were sick and tired of it. If they knew they were footing the bill for it, I think that they would be saying that there was something wrong with the system.</para>
<para>So Family First is saying: let us put a cap of $10 million maximum on the election funding that taxpayers have to put in for any political party. That will peg back the $22 million that Labor got back from taxpayers. So, there is a $12 million saving there. For the Liberal Party, at $18 million, there is $8 million saved there. So basically there is $20 million saved. Think of what $20 million taxpayers’ money could be spent on other than excessive television ads and mail drops. That $20 million could be spent on all sorts of things for the community, and I went through those in my speech before. That money could be spent on 57 dedicated breast cancer nurses. That is what $20 million would get. Rather than seeing more mail stuffed into our letterboxes and more advertising shoved down our throats on television, $20 million could be used for investing in more teachers or it could help the poor. I think that most Australians would say that that sounds a better deal than spending $20 million more of their funds when political parties are really spending enough as it is. I urge all senators to support the Family First amendment to limit to $10 million election funding to any political party by the public purse.</para>

<para>—The coalition will not be supporting Senator Fielding’s amendment, but I will say that Senator Fielding has obviously raised an issue that needs to be discussed at some length in this campaign finance reform process. I would have preferred that discussion to take place in the context of that process, but I can understand that Senator Fielding has been moved to do that because the Labor Party themselves have not, in my view, done the right thing with the deductibility bill. That should also have been part of this wide discussion.</para>
</talk.start>
<para>Back in March of last year, Senator Fielding supported the coalition motion on a reference to the Joint Standing Committee on Electoral Matters. Part of that was the appropriateness of current levels of public funding provided for political parties and candidates contesting federal elections. This is a debate that has to be had and it should not be done in isolation. It should be in toto. I agreed with Senator Ludlam when he said that this is just the start of the process. The coalition believes absolutely that this is just the start of the process. It needs a commonsense approach to an issue that the Australian community believes is a serious one, and quite rightly so. It will require the goodwill of everyone in this place. In fact, we are charged with the responsibility of putting in place a campaign finance reform proposal that restores some faith in the process to the Australian community and provides a workable solution to an issue that I think is of concern.</para>

<para>—I find it quite unbelievable that Senator Conroy has interjected in relation to this matter. Sometimes it is smarter to say nothing than to toss in a throwaway line. I appreciate that his recent ‘marriage’ to Senator Carr in Victoria has probably clouded his judgement a little bit. In fact, if it had happened to me it would have completely clouded mine.</para>

<para>I think it is extraordinary that we had evidence this morning that the federal Labor Party rejected a donation of $499,980 from the wife of Mr Stanley Ho but that the New South Wales division of the Labor Party was quite happy to accept—taking a figure off the top of my head—something approaching $600,000 or $800,000. And where did that money end up? In the finances of the federal Labor Party. So do not talk to me, Senator Conroy, about foundations. Please, jump up and tell the chamber that there are no foundations run by the Labor Party that are providing administrative support to the Australian Labor Party, because you know as well as I do that that is patent nonsense.</para>
<para>That sort of interjection is actually standing in the way of a sensible approach to this issue. We have all acknowledged that there is an issue and we all acknowledge that we have got to do something about it—or we can play games. You were prepared to sit back and accept $61.4 million in funding from the union movement between 1 July 2006 and 30 June 2008, and then you come in here with legislation that is designed to protect union donations going to Australian Labor Party coffers but that denies tax deductibility for ordinary Australians who want to participate in the political process. The level is very small, but they are passionate about it. I think we have got a clear indication of who wants campaign finance reform and who does not. I suspect that it is this side of the chamber and the Greens and Family First and Senator Xenophon, but it is not the Australian Labor Party. So either we approach this sensibly or we have churlish and childish interjections about who is doing what.</para>
<para>I am backing the side that thinks we need to do something. I am backing the side of the Australian community, who think there is something terribly wrong with our system. They have watched the Wollongong sex and bribery scandal and they know that if we do not do something the only ones who will suffer will be the Australian community. But we have got this tax deductibility bill that does not resolve the Wollongong sex and bribery scandal.</para>
<para>Let us have a sensible discussion about where we are going to take the campaign finance reform agenda. Let us work together, which I think we are capable of doing, and let us get an outcome that is an appropriate legacy to restore some confidence in the system, because I think that confidence has, quite frankly, disappeared. It is incumbent upon us to do something about it. But when you are protecting your funding base by bringing in legislation that is designed only to maintain a difference in ability to raise funds, I do not think you are terribly serious about it. If it is trying to entrench a differential between the Australian Labor Party and every other political party in this country, I think the Australian Labor Party needs to have a good, long, hard look at itself. There is no point in going through processes such as the green paper and protesting that you are engaged in this process when today, 24 hours after the AEC released its figures for last year, you are prepared to debate in this place a bill with which you are trying to entrench that differential. It really does beggar belief. So let us do this properly and acknowledge the role of political parties and individuals within the political system and let us acknowledge that they do require funding to maintain their activities. Let us sit down and work out the best way of delivering that which restores some confidence back into the system for the Australian people.</para>

<para>—I indicate that we do not support Senator Fielding’s amendment. The government are committed to introducing fundamental reform of Australia’s political finance regime. This reform process is progressing, with the first electoral green paper on donations, funding and expenditure, which was released on 17 December 2008. That paper looks at all issues surrounding how political candidates and parties are funded, including whether donations should be banned or capped and what level of public funding is appropriate. The question of public funding is more appropriately dealt with through that process.</para>
</talk.start>
<para>Given his interest in the issue, the government would encourage Senator Fielding of Family First to make a submission on the green paper by the 23 February deadline. The government will be consulting with Senator Fielding, as well as the opposition and other parties and senators, as it develops its response to the political consultation.</para>

<para>—I indicate that I do not support Senator Fielding’s amendment because I believe that is best in relation to the whole issue of political donations and contributions and in terms of public funding as well. I think that what Senator Fielding has raised is an important point: that we need to look at the overall total levels of expenditure for campaigns. Whether or not we go down the path of the Canadian model is one of the options that has been discussed in the green paper. My principal reason for opposing this is that I believe that the bill is confined to the issue of tax deductibility of political donations and the sentiments of this amendment ought to be dealt with in a bill that covers the substantive issue of levels of campaign funding in terms of public funding and overall expenditure. That bill will hopefully be before this place in the not too distant future.</para>

<para>—I think it is very important for those people who are following this debate to fully understand there is only one political party in Australia that actually thinks it is an absolute rort and a joke for tax deductibility status to be given to political parties. No other party here today wants to stand against that. In fact they are all tiptoeing around the issue. This particular amendment is also dealing with another rort. I will read out again this material from the Australian Electoral Commission’s website. It is under ‘Public funding paid’. In 2007 in public funding $22 million of taxpayers’ hard-earned money was paid to the Labor Party; $18 million was paid to the Liberal Party. How much is enough? Well, I think $10 million is enough for any political party to put across their point of view. We are turning people off by advertising so much and putting out letterbox drops during an election campaign. It is too much. We could save $20 million. We could use that $20 million of taxpayers’ money which could be saved by capping and stopping any political party from getting more than $10 million from the public purse. We could spend that $20 million on teachers and nurses and on all sorts of things.</para>
</talk.start>
<para>This rort should not continue. I make it clear to the rest of the senators that Family First will oppose this bill for the two reasons that tax deductibility should not be there for any political party and that we should be capping the public funding of campaigns according to some reasonable position. So I am making it clear that Family First will vote against this bill. If the coalition members can muster themselves into this chamber, this bill will be defeated tonight for the reason that we have got to stop this rort now.</para>

<para>—I rise to indicate the coalition will be supporting the <inline ref="S706">Corporations Amendment (No. 1) Bill 2008 [2009]</inline>. This bill prevents persons who were disqualified as company directors in New Zealand from becoming directors in Australia. The bill addresses a loophole in the existing law whereby people can effectively avoid disqualification by simply moving across the Tasman.</para>
</talk.start>
<para>The objectives of this bill are in line with the principles espoused in the memorandum of understanding, or MOU, on business law harmonisation between the two countries. The benefits of mutually recognising director disqualification were raised by the former coalition government in 2006. That arose because in 1988 the Australian and New Zealand governments signed an MOU on the harmonisation of business law, thereby providing the starting point for dialogue between our two countries on business law issues. The original MOU has been subject to review every five years, the most recent of which took place in 2006 under the guidance of the then coalition Treasurer, Peter Costello. The 2006 review brought forth a revised agenda. Specific areas of business law such as director law harmonisation were identified, where it was thought that greater coordination would produce mutual benefits. New Zealand closed this regulatory gap by amending their Companies Act 1993 in 2006. The Australian bill is modelled on the New Zealand amendment of that year in order to provide cross-border consistency. This new level of harmonisation between the two nations takes us one step closer to achieving the one single economic market, the benefits of which will provide certainty and enhanced productivity and will assist cross-border entrepreneurship.</para>
<para>The Corporations Act will be amended by this bill to automatically disqualify someone from becoming a company director in Australia if they have been disqualified in New Zealand. The bill will extend the mechanism of Australian courts to disqualify people from becoming company directors where they have been disqualified by the law of a foreign jurisdiction. Only New Zealand will be prescribed at this point but the facility to prescribe other jurisdictions will be established by this amendment. Also, the bill will provide a facility for the Australian Securities and Investments Commission to apply to a court in order to disqualify directors of prescribed jurisdictions.</para>
<para>Consultation with industry reveals that key industry stakeholders are in support of these measures. The Australian Institute of Company Directors has publicly stated its support. The institute explains that these measures will provide a statutory framework which will assist its organisation in work already undertaken to exclude directors. In summary, the coalition will of course be supporting this legislation because it was by our actions in the previous government that this legislation has been brought about. I commend the bill to the Senate.</para>

<para>—I was going to say ‘thanks to honourable senators’, but only one senator spoke, Senator Bernardi. I would like to thank him for taking part in the debate on the <inline ref="S706">Corporations Amendment (No. 1) Bill 2008 [2009]</inline>. In summary, the bill establishes a framework by which individuals who are disqualified from managing companies in prescribed foreign countries can also be disqualified in Australia either automatically or by court order. As such, the bill will improve protection for investors and the integrity of Australia’s markets. New Zealand will be the first prescribed country that these provisions will operate in relation to; however, other countries will be able to be added at a later date.</para>
</talk.start>
<para>The bill provides that a person will be automatically disqualified from managing corporations in Australia where they have been disqualified by a court in a prescribed country. In addition, an Australian court will have the power to disqualify a person from managing corporations on application by the Australian Securities and Investments Commission where the person has been disqualified under the law of a prescribed foreign country. This provision will cover situations where, for example, a person has been disqualified by a foreign regulator.</para>
<para>These arrangements will ensure that all people disqualified in Australia on the basis that they have been disqualified in a prescribed foreign country have had their disqualification scrutinised by a court. In this way, the bill addresses the specific concern that people who are disqualified from managing corporations in New Zealand could still manage corporations in Australia simply by crossing the Tasman. The bill fulfils a requirement under the Australian and New Zealand governments’ memorandum of understanding on business law coordination, moving us a step closer to achieving the policy goal of establishing a single trans-Tasman economic market based on common regulatory frameworks. New Zealand enacted its complementary provisions in 2007 and in the interest of cross-border consistency these amendments have been modelled on those of New Zealand. The regulations will be drafted in such a way as to allow other countries to be added at a later date.</para>
<para>Finally, I can inform the Senate that the Ministerial Council for Corporations—MINCO—was consulted in relation to these amendments to the laws and the national corporate regulation scheme and has approved them as required under the corporations agreement. I have also commenced consultation with MINCO on the accompanying regulations. Provided that approval is received, the regulation should be ready to commence contemporaneously with the provisions of the bill. I commend the bill to the Senate.</para>

<para class="block">As the Senate would be aware, the Greens support the bill and certainly think that it is reasonable to legislate to make certain that a person unfit to manage a corporation in a foreign jurisdiction should equally be found to be unsuitable here. However, the Greens would like to take this opportunity with the Corporations Act to seek greater accountability for large executive termination payouts. In these times of economic turmoil, when calls for fiscal discipline and accusations of corporate negligence abound and when the public purse is being opened for the benefit of private interests, there is growing popular support for executive remunerative restraint. In fact, the Prime Minister has recognised this in his public comments on the issue, but we have seen no concrete outcomes.</para>
<para>The amendment the Greens are moving is very restrained and is not controversial. In fact, it places a limit on the magnitude of the golden handshake that executives might receive. It requires any handout that exceeds $1 million to be subject to the vote of shareholders—that is, it permits the owners of a company to have a say on whether they consider an executive’s performance is worth upwards of $1 million of their capital.</para>
<para>The amendment to the Corporations Act gives shareholders the power to restrict those termination payments. It requires shareholder approval for any termination payment, including vesting of unvested equity incentives above $1 million. Vesting is essentially a right to an asset, even if that asset is not yet in the person’s possession. Unvested equity incentive means that executives are given share options packages and they are part of termination payout deals. Those shares are committed but not exchanged during the course of employment and are realised upon termination, and that substantially increases the size of the termination payments.</para>
<para>The Greens amendment specifically closes this loophole, which allows for the use of unvested incentives as part of termination payments. It is needed because currently the Corporations Act does not require shareholder approval for termination payments above a threshold of seven times the total remuneration. However, the provisions are not sufficiently tight to prevent any decent lawyer finding the loophole to which I have referred. When some of the recent termination payouts are considered, this requirement is enthusiastically ignored.</para>
<para>According to research conducted in 2008 by governance advisory group RiskMetrics, boards of most companies surveyed flouted the law to pay departing executives extremely generous packages. For example, the survey found that the average CEO of a top Australian company received just over $3.4 million as a termination payment—or 201 per cent of the annual salary on termination. Twenty-three of the 33 CEOs surveyed received termination payments greater than $1 million. Many of these CEOs are from companies that participated in the excessive greed that has led to the financial crisis both overseas and here in Australia. They have walked away with their packages and the community is now paying. The broader community is paying. With the collapse in the share prices, the shareholders are paying. People are also paying with the collapse in the value of their superannuation.</para>
<para>We know that one of the largest termination payments was to Santos’s CEO, John Ellice-Flint. It was $16.8 million. He received that $16.8 million, including 2.313 million unvested options. The total package assumed that the options were vested at the time of termination. His base salary was $2,691,995. The payout turned out to be 625 per cent of his annual salary. I do not think that people in Australia are very happy with that kind of payout. Shareholders are certainly unhappy with it. Allan Moss’s termination payment from Macquarie Bank was up to $80 million. Come on! How many people are worth that? Look at Sol Trujillo’s current salary of $13.39 million. Imagine what he might get at termination. Nicholas Moore from Macquarie Bank earns $26.8 million. Look at Phil Green from Babcock and Brown. I am sure that the shareholders, given the current state of that company, would not be impressed with the $22.1 million salary and share package that he gets. And so it goes on. Looking at a payout other than the two that I have mentioned, David Murray from the CBA got $17.5 million.</para>
<para>This is a very sensible amendment. One of the first things that Barack Obama did as United States President was to move on these excessive corporate packages. He is about to do that. We have heard a lot from the Prime Minister, and yet nothing has happened. When the Greens moved this amendment last year it was rejected. But that was last year, when greed was okay and neoliberalism was the philosophy of choice. This year, that has changed. We are now no longer neoliberals. We believe that greed is a real problem in the market and that we need to fix it up. We are essentially giving the Senate another opportunity to vote on this now that there has been a change of position in relation to neoliberalism.</para>
<para>It is also clear that Obama gives the current Prime Minister some courage. Obama has broken new ground; he is moving on this. So there is a good reason for Australia to do so now that the US, the home of capitalism, is moving to recognise that there is excessive greed in these excessive termination payments. This amendment will close a loophole. It will allow shareholders a vote on this issue if payments are in excess of $1 million. It will make sure that the package is $1 million and cannot be camouflaged with options and shares and so on. It is perfectly reasonable. It is in line with community sentiment. I am sure that, now that we recognise that excessive greed has been a major driver of the current financial crisis, there will be a change of heart here in the Senate. I look forward to other senators supporting the Greens in making sure that these obscene termination payouts are stopped, that loopholes are closed and that we give shareholders the right to determine what happens to their money.</para>

<para>—In the brief time available, I want to commence my contribution on this issue. As Senator Milne has rightly pointed out, this amendment is identical to an amendment that I recall was moved on two occasions last year and which I spoke on. The first point that I want to make is on Senator Milne’s reference to the circumstances in the United States. The circumstances in the United States are quite different from the circumstances that exist in Australia. The circumstances in the US mean that we could probably dub it ‘the home of socialism’ now, I suspect, given the extent of bank bailouts, takeovers and mergers et cetera. That is one of the legacies of former President George Bush. There are other issues, but when we are discussing executive remuneration it is important to distinguish between the issues in the United States and the issues in Australia. In the US, what is known as the subprime crisis commenced with the distribution of mortgage based products that were miss-sold and in the passing of those securitised products—</para>

<para>—I rise to reflect on the government’s management of the economy. When it comes to managing the economy, we have a government that is completely out of its depth. We have a government that has not got a clue what it is doing. When faced with one of the most, if not the most, significant global economic downturns, it is behaving like a rabbit in the headlights. Let us just reflect on the events of the last two years. The Australian people were deceived before the last election into believing that Kevin Rudd would be an economic conservative. They were deceived into believing that, under Kevin Rudd, they would have the same responsible economic management as they had experienced and benefited from under 12 years of the Howard-Costello government.</para>
</talk.start>
<para>What happened after the election? Let us reflect on the events. The Treasurer and the Prime Minister, for political reasons, talked up inflation and talked up interest rates so that they could find something to undermine the economic legacy of the Howard-Costello government. Of course, it was purely for political reasons and what they did was actually bad for the Australian economy. Then we had Labor’s first budget. Today we have had Kevin Rudd saying, ‘We protected the surplus in our first budget.’ Let us read the fine print: $20 billion worth of additional taxes and a $15 billion increase in net spending. Taxing, taxing, taxing, spending, spending, spending is the history of the Labor Party in this country and the history of social democratic administrations, as the Prime Minister now wants to describe them, around the world. The reality is this: trying to spend your way out of trouble always ends up in tears.</para>
<para>So what have we got? We have a government that went on a pre-Christmas spending spree, which clearly has not worked. People in my home state of Western Australia are saying to me: ‘What is happening in Canberra? They are pissing all this money up against the wall and have nothing to show for it.’</para>

<para>—Mr President, I withdraw that word. I was seeking to express to the chamber the sentiments that my constituents are putting forward to me. A $22 billion surplus has gone, wasted, with nothing to show for it. This was even before the pre-Christmas spending spree. What else do we have when it comes to economic management? The reality is that we have a government here that proposes ideologically based initiatives without thinking through the implications for our economy. We see it again and again.</para>
</talk.start>
</continue>
<para>Most recently, we have had some debates about the impact of the government’s proposed emissions trading scheme. Anybody across Australia, from any side of politics, that dares to ask any questions, that dares to insist on some scrutiny of the details or of the impact on jobs or on the economy gets howled down: ‘You’re a nonbeliever! You’re a sceptic! Don’t dare ask any questions.’ The problem for the government, of course, is that its own members and senators are starting to ask questions. Not only that but the National Secretary of the Australian Workers Union has started to ask questions because he is worried about the impact that the flawed design of this Carbon Pollution Reduction Scheme will have on the jobs of his members. We have a responsibility in this chamber to apply proper scrutiny to the government and what it is proposing, no matter how much bullying comes from the other side and no matter how many attempts there are to prevent us from doing our job.</para>
<para>I asked Senator Conroy today whether he was aware of the calls from Mr Paul Howes, the National Secretary of the Australian Workers Union, to have some additional Treasury modelling to assess the impact of the government’s proposed Carbon Pollution Reduction Scheme on the economy and on jobs. He did not take the question seriously. With absolute arrogance and contempt, he said, ‘I’m not even going to answer this question because it is based on the wrong premise.’ What does he mean—based on the wrong premise? We have Treasury modelling which was very clearly based on very optimistic assumptions and which, even according to the Treasurer himself and to Treasury officials themselves, did not assess the impact of the global financial crisis in terms of the forecast of that particular modelling. There are respected people ranging from Dr Brian Fisher, who reported to the Senate Select Committee on Fuel and Energy yesterday about his assessment of the Treasury modelling, all the way over to Mr Paul Howes, from the Australian Workers Union, who are saying: ‘The Treasury modelling was flawed. We are concerned. We think the government should have another look at this.’</para>
<para>On the one hand we have rhetoric from the government that we are facing the worst economic crisis ever and on the other hand they are saying that it does not really matter. There would be a significant shift in the way the economy in Australia will operate with the additional costs imposed as a result of the tax on carbon under the Carbon Pollution Reduction Scheme, but the government is not prepared to talk about it. They are not prepared to talk about how we can ensure that there will not be further job losses as a result of what the government is trying to ram through this parliamentary system. We are not allowed to ask any questions because we just get dismissed as climate change sceptics or nonbelievers.</para>
<para>When I reflect on the events of the last 12 to 14 months since Kevin Rudd took over as Prime Minister, what I can see is a government whose first instinct, when faced with a challenge, is to tax, to spend and to come up with some ideologically driven initiatives which are actually going to make things worse rather than better. We have a precedent for this in our political history. This is what Gough Whitlam did in the 1972 to 1975 period. The government would be well advised to remember the experiences of the Whitlam years because after three years Australia threw them out. If you think that you can spend your way out of trouble, ultimately it ends up in tears.</para>
<para>I will give some free and gratuitous advice to the government. Governments cannot inject new money into the economy. All that governments can do is take money from taxpayers—either today’s taxpayers or, after borrowing money, tomorrow’s taxpayers—and distribute it according to their preferences. Does this government really believe that Labor governments are better able to ensure that the available resources in the economy are allocated to the needs of the Australian people than what can happen in the context of a free market? Does it really believe that? Does this government believe that it is a responsible act to borrow billions and billions of dollars, which will essentially bill future generations, so that it can follow its absolute obsession to spend, spend, spend, no matter what the consequences?</para>
<para>The government’s actions will end up in tears. It is not pursuing responsible economic policy. This is a government that has no answers other than to tax and to spend. Quite frankly, I do hope that this Senate is going to reflect very seriously on the possible consequences of what has been generally emerging over the last 18 months and earlier today.</para>

<para>—I rise today to speak on the issue of world poverty. A recent campaign by Micah Challenge Australia helped highlight to the house late last year the pressing issues of world poverty. As a result of the Micah Challenge visit, Senators Mark Arbib and Guy Barnett discussed in this place some weeks ago the devastating effects of poverty and I commend their contributions on this issue.</para>
</talk.start>
<para>The Micah Challenge is an international movement of Christians running campaigns in 29 countries to encourage world leaders to meet the Millennium Development Goals. I had the opportunity to meet with one of the Micah Challenge delegations that visited parliament recently and I was impressed by their enthusiasm, their passion and their commitment to eradicating world poverty. I found it refreshing to sit down and listen to young people discuss their bold vision as to how developed countries such as Australia should address poverty in our region. Australians would all agree that we live in the lucky country despite the world economic crisis. However, it is difficult to comprehend just how unlucky so many billions of people in the world are and to comprehend the appalling conditions they face every day.</para>
<para>The Micah Challenge delegation informed me of some alarming statistics: 923 million of the world’s people are undernourished; 1.4 billion people live on less then US$1.25 a day; every year 9.2 million children under the age of five die from mostly preventable illnesses and diseases that possibly no child in a developed country would die from; 2.6 billion people live in poor sanitary conditions that contribute to disease; 72 million primary school age children do not go to school; and 33 million people are living with HIV, with 2.5 million infections each year, predominantly in Africa.</para>
<para>These appalling statistics are nearly impossible to conceptualise. It is impossible to imagine the immense suffering of 923 million individual people or to try and visualise in one’s mind the enormity of 9.2 million children dying on an annual basis largely from preventable diseases. We cannot let the plight of 923 million people become just a number or just an abstraction. We must not let the size of the problem daunt policymakers or allow them to think that these issues are simply too hard to solve. Action can and must be taken.</para>
<para>The Millennium Development Goals agreed upon in Geneva in 2000 by nations around the world including Australia provide an important framework for tackling this urgent problem. There are eight Millennium Development Goals and the deadline for achieving these is the target year of 2015. They are lofty goals but ones that we should be doing our very best to achieve.</para>
<para>Goal No. 1 is to halve by 2015 the number of people whose income is less than $1 a day and who suffer from hunger. Goal No. 2 is to ensure that by 2015 all children complete at least a full course of primary schooling. Goal No. 3 is to achieve gender equality in primary and secondary education. Goal No. 4 is to reduce by two-thirds the under-five mortality rate. Goal No. 5 is to reduce by three-quarters the maternal mortality ratio. Goal No. 6 states that by 2015 the spread of HIV will be halted and that there will be a start on the reversal of the disease. Goal No. 7 is to halve the proportion of people without sustainable access to safe drinking water and basic sanitation. And, finally, goal No. 8 is to create a global partnership for development under an open, non-discriminatory trading and financial system.</para>
<para>Australia has an important role to play in helping achieve these worthy objectives. I commend the Rudd government, which is obviously in difficult economic times, for committing Australia to spending 0.5 per cent of gross national income on overseas aid projects by the year 2015.</para>
<para>In the 2008 federal budget, the Australian government increased funding in official development assistance by nine per cent in real terms, bringing current expenditure on overseas aid to 0.32 per cent of gross national income. These increases in aid funding are essential because Australia has an important role to play in combating poverty in our region. If one is to believe the old adage, ‘charity begins at home’, perhaps a case could be made for a compulsory donation by people who earn more than $250,000 per annum towards boosting Australia’s Millennium Development Goals contribution. I doubt if such people would miss, say, $2.50 or $5 a week and, as a British statesman once said, ‘We make a living by what we get, but we make a life by what we give.’</para>
<para>Unfortunately, poverty affects millions of people in Australia’s own backyard. Each year 24,000 mothers and 400,000 children in the Asia-Pacific region die from preventable causes. For example, Australia’s closest regional neighbour, Indonesia, has the highest mortality rate of any South-East Asian country. More than 50 per cent of the Indonesian population live on less than US$2 a day, 50 million Indonesians lack access to clean water and over 71 million Indonesians lack access to proper sanitation.</para>
<para>The aid that Australia provides to Indonesia is in our national interest. Reducing poverty helps reduce political instability in developing nations and minimises the likelihood of political upheaval. If the world economic crisis continues, there is the potential for political instability to increase. If there is no progress towards improving the quality of life of millions of people living in poverty in our region then we can expect the demand for Australia’s peacekeeping forces to increase into the future.</para>
<para>As I have indicated, poor economic conditions may often cause political instability. During the Asian economic crisis of 1997, not only was Indonesia hit hard economically but it also went through a revolution. Fortunately, the dictatorial Suharto regime was replaced by a parliamentary democracy. It remains in Australia’s best interest to have stable government in Indonesia. Reducing the severe economic imbalances in the region will help entrench stable governments in South-East Asia and will improve the esteem in which our nation is held throughout the region.</para>
<para>I would like to finish by recognising the fine work that faith based organisations such as the Micah Challenge and World Vision do to help people who are struggling. Faith is incredibly important to many people in the world’s charities and underpins their work. Faith provides them with the motivation to speak out against injustice and to persevere despite the enormity of the task that they face. The work of the Micah Challenge is about putting faith into practice.</para>
<para>I would also like to thank the Micah Challenge for raising this important issue with my colleagues and me. It was sobering to learn the true extent of the problems faced by millions of people living in poverty, which in turn become our problems also. By setting targets to reduce poverty, we can help to achieve an improvement for those doing it tough. Importantly, setting targets encourages us to take action now rather than to sit back. I sincerely hope that we meet all of these targets by 2015.</para>
<para>In closing, I would ask senators to remember that nobody can do everything, but everybody can do something. Thank you.</para>

<para>—As I speak in the Senate chamber tonight, an equivalent water capacity to that of Sydney Harbour is pouring over the Burdekin Dam and down the Burdekin River, not far from where I live in Ayr in North Queensland. Senators will be well aware that in the last several weeks there have been enormous falls of rain right throughout North, Far North and north-west Queensland. It is interesting to see the Minister for Climate Change and Water in the chamber. Lest she might think that this wet weather has been caused by climate change, can I assure her that what we are seeing at the moment is a return to how it used to be 20 years ago or, even further back in time, to when I was growing up in the north. We always had a very heavy wet season, with the monsoons coming down. This was associated with regular cyclones, which those of us who have lived in the north for a long time have come to accept as being the norm.</para>
</talk.start>
<para>As I speak, severe flooding is occurring in the northern sugar town of Ingham, about 100 kilometres north of Townsville. I know that the mayor there, Councillor Pino Giandomenico, is out there with his troops in the SES and with council workers, moving people to higher ground and doing what can be done to assist those who are being subjected to flooding. The fact that we are used to it and that it does happen regularly does not in any way mitigate the real dramas, tragedies and personal human hurts that are occasioned by these natural phenomena.</para>
<para>I want to alert the government to the fact that these very heavy rains are occurring right throughout the north, and I urge that the generosity which we have seen from the Australian taxpayers today, through the government, is focused to a degree on our home. Charity begins at home, of course. Many people and councils in the north will need assistance through Commonwealth funding to meet some of the damage to homes and infrastructure that has been caused by these natural calamities. I urge the government to be generous when the councils apply for flood relief and for the reconstruction of damaged roads—that will need to happen.</para>
<para>All senators would have heard of Cyclone Charlotte, which crossed the coast coming in from the Gulf of Carpentaria earlier this year. It has meant that some of the areas of the north-west—up around Normanton and Karumba in particular—have been cut off by road from other means of sustenance for some time. At Karumba, a fishing port on the gulf, which is now a tourist destination for many, particularly the grey nomads, the community has for some time had quite a good airstrip, but it has not been sealed. For a long time, the Karumba community has been calling on governments to assist them with the sealing of the airstrip. These floods, cutting them off again for a month or more, really highlight the absolute necessity of sealing the strip at Karumba so that when you cannot get in by road you can at least get a plane in.</para>
<para>Because the strip is not sealed, this is not possible—there are all sorts of problems. A constituent got in contact with my office and said that, because they cannot drive out of Karumba, they have to helicopter out of Karumba over to Cairns, then get the plane down to Townsville, hire a car and drive their kids to boarding schools in Charters Towers. They get some state government assistance for that, but you can imagine it would not be enough to cover the cost just of getting the kids to school. That is just one instance of many things that happen in remote parts of Australia. I ask the government to seriously look at the application for funding the sealing of the airstrip at Karumba when that application comes forward. They applied last year and were knocked back, but I hope their application this year is better dealt with.</para>
<para>I repeat my call for government action to start looking at duplication of the bridge over the Burdekin River between Ayr and Home Hill. It is the only link between the best part of both Australia and Queensland—that is, the area north of the Burdekin River—and the south of our country. There is one very narrow dual-lane bridge over the Burdekin River. Particularly at times like tonight, all of the other methods of getting to the north, even if you went right out to the west and were to come around via Mount Isa or Cloncurry, as you could do in other times, would not be possible because of flood waters throughout the Flinders and all of that area. That needs to be done in the near future.</para>
<para>The floods and the flows in the Flinders River, which passes by Hughenden and Richmond and moves on to the gulf, and the Leichhardt River, which goes beyond Mount Isa and out to the sea near Normanton and Burketown, can be harnessed. There are some very sensible and sustainable plans for water storage off the Flinders River which would allow for huge expansion of agriculture in the Richmond-Hughenden area of North Queensland. We will need food, not only for Australia but for the world, in the years ahead. Here is a classic opportunity where the enormous millions of megalitres of water that are now just flowing out to the sea could be harnessed in a very sustainable way that would not have any impact whatsoever on the ecology, on the prawning in the gulf or on anything else that some people sometimes say militates against dams and water storages on those rivers. These plans really should be looked at. There have been a number of conferences in recent years, and I spoke in the Senate about some just before Christmas.</para>
<para>The very heavy rains we are having in North Queensland at the present time highlight that we have there a fantastic asset which can be harnessed and which should be looked at by governments much more seriously in the future. The Queensland government keeps making all the right noises but never does anything—a lot of talk, conferences, seminars, reports and investigations but, unfortunately, never any action. I think the amount of water that at the present time is running down the Flinders in particular highlights the need for a serious look at environmentally sustainable water storages on that river.</para>
<para>I know all senators and, indeed, all Australians will be thinking of people in North Queensland as many there face these flood problems over the next week or so. The rain is continuing as I speak, bucketing down in Ingham, Townsville and my home town of Ayr, but we are used to that in the north. We live there because we like it there and we accept these things as normal. But when some assistance is needed I know the Australian government—and the Australian people through the Australian government—will be generous and thinking of the people in the north as they deal with these latest flood events in that neck of the woods.</para>

<para class="block" pgwide="yes">The financial information provided above for Ministerial and accompanying MOP(S) Act staff (Adviser) travel expenses was provided by the Department of Finance and Deregulation (DFD) [with the exception of $7.910.44 and $7,649.52 paid by DHA for airfares for Minister Ellis and her Adviser respectively, to attend the Olympics, and to be reimbursed by DFD under MOPS arrangements]. This advice is accurate as at 29 October 2008. DFD has advised that some trips remain unreconciled given that the travel was undertaken recently. This means that DFD may not have received all accounts and information from the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade (DFAT) Overseas Posts, and may not have acquitted the travel allowances paid.</para>
<para class="block" pgwide="yes">DFD has advised that as further expenditure is paid they do not intend to revisit or update the information provided given the diversion of resources required to undertake this task.</para>
<para class="block" pgwide="yes">* DFD is unable to disaggregate accommodation costs between the Minister and her Adviser. Therefore the figure provided for accommodation represents approximately half of the total accommodation costs charged to the Minister and her Adviser allowing for differences in room standards.</para>

<quote pgwide="yes">
<list type="decimal">
<item label="(1)">
<para>The Australian Government is committed to ensuring the conservation of koalas across their natural range.</para>
<para>The 1998 National Koala Conservation Strategy (the Strategy) was developed by the Commonwealth, state and territory governments, in recognition of the importance of the koala to Australia’s natural and cultural heritage. It was intended to provide a nationally coordinated approach to koala conservation in order to retain viable populations in the wild throughout the koala’s natural range.</para>
<para>In 2006, the Natural Resource Management Ministerial Council (NRMMC) agreed to review the Strategy. The review is being overseen by a Steering Committee, chaired by the Commonwealth Department of the Environment, Water, Heritage and the Arts and comprising representatives from the range states (NSW, Vic, SA, and QLD) and the Australian Koala Foundation.</para>
<para>To contribute to this review, the Australian Government has funded an evaluation of progress made in implementing the Strategy. The report from this evaluation has been provided to the Steering Committee as input to the Strategy review.</para>
<para>To support a revised Strategy the Steering Committee will also develop an implementation plan to provide clear directions, priorities and timetables to meet the objectives of the strategy.</para>
<para>It is expected the Steering Committee will provide its recommendations to the NRMMC in 2009.</para>
</item>
<item label="(2)">
<para>&amp; (3) Under the Queensland Nature Conservation Act 1992, the koala is listed as vulnerable in the South Eastern Queensland Bioregion, and common elsewhere in the State. In New South Wales, the koala is listed as vulnerable, however the ‘Hawks Nest and Tea Gardens’ and the ‘Pittwater Local Government Area’ populations are listed as endangered under the New South Wales Threatened Species Conservation Act 1995. The koala was listed as rare under the South Australian National Parks and Wildlife Act 1972, however it was removed from the list in its most recent revision. The koala is not listed as threatened under the Australian Capital Territory Nature Conservation Act 1980 nor the Victorian Flora and Fauna Guarantee Act 1988.</para>
<para>The koala has been nominated twice for listing as nationally threatened under the Endangered Species Protection Act 1992 (ESP Act) and once under the Environment Protection and Biodiversity Conservation Act 1999 (EPBC Act). The most recent assessment was in 2006 under the EPBC Act. On each occasion the advice of the relevant independent scientific committee (Endangered Species Scientific Subcommittee and the Threatened Species Scientific Committee (TSSC)) was that while the species was subject to conservation pressures and that some local populations had declined, the koala did not meet the criteria for listing as threatened at the national level. This advice was accepted by the former ministers (Hill and Campbell) and the koala was not listed.</para>
<para>On the Threatened Species Scientific Committee’s recommendation, the Minister for the Environment, Heritage and the Arts has placed the koala on the Finalised Priority Assessment List for the assessment period commencing 1 October 2008. The TSSC will now undertake a new assessment of the koala’s conservation status and advise the Minister if the koala should be listed as a nationally threatened species under the EPBC Act. The assessment will be completed by 30 September 2010.</para>
</item>
<item label="(4)">
<para>The Minister for Agriculture, Fisheries and Forestry has provided the following answer to this question:</para>
<para>There are a number of instruments that provide protection for threatened flora and fauna. Clause 57 of the Regional Forest Agreement for the Eden Region of NSW states that:</para>
<para>‘the Parties agree that the Comprehensive, Adequate and Representative Reserve System, actions under the New South Wales Biodiversity Strategy, Threatened Species Conservation Act 1995 (NSW) and the Endangered Species Protection Act 1992 (Commonwealth), Forestry and National Parks Estate Act 1998 (NSW) and the application of a range of management strategies, management plans and the Integrated Forestry Operations Approval will provide for the protection of rare or threatened flora and fauna species and ecological communities.’</para>
<para>The koala is listed as vulnerable under the New South Wales Threatened Species Conservation Act 1995, and therefore is provided protection under the instruments listed above.</para>
<para>Victoria has specific forest management practices for managing the impact of timber harvesting on koala populations in East Gippsland. Within East Gippsland, known resident koala populations are included within Special Protection Zone areas. Timber harvesting is not permitted within Special Protection Zones.</para>

<para>—The answer to the honourable senator’s question is as follows:</para>
</talk.start>
<quote pgwide="yes">
<para class="block" pgwide="yes">On 26 September and 12 October 2008 the Government announced that the Australian Office of Financial Management (AOFM) will purchase residential mortgage-backed securities (RMBS) to support competition in Australia’s mortgage markets. Up to $8 billion is available for investment, with at least $4 billion to be allocated to issuers/originators that are non-authorised deposit taking institutions.</para>
<para class="block" pgwide="yes">The AOFM requires that the RMBS it purchases have AAA credit ratings from at least two of the major credit rating agencies. It also has specified minimum requirements for the securities which help ensure that they are of high credit quality. These requirements are detailed in AOFM Operational Notice No. 10/2008 of 13 October 2008 which is available on the AOFM web site (www.aofm.gov.au).</para>
<para class="block" pgwide="yes">The credit quality of RMBS depends on the characteristics of the mortgage assets that back the securities, together with the credit support arrangements for the securities, including the structure of the various classes of securities within each issue and insurance coverage. The AOFM considers these arrangements as part of its due diligence assessments of proposed purchases. It also required monthly reporting on the composition of the mortgages supporting the securities purchased and regular reviews of the ratings of the issues by the credit rating agencies.</para>
<para class="block" pgwide="yes">I announced the Australian review into credit rating agencies on 22 May 2008. The outcomes from the review were announced on 13 November 2008. Further information can be obtained from the media release which I issued concluding the review. It can be obtained from my Ministerial web site. Further information about the review is also available in the website of the Australian Securities and Investments Commission.</para>

<para>There have been two disputes relating to delivery contracts that have resulted in legal action. One occurred in 2001 and was settled prior to the Australian Industrial Relations Commission (AIRC) hearing and the other is due to be heard in the AIRC in May 2009.</para>

<para>Circumstances of individual contractors vary greatly and may influence the tender price that a tenderer chooses to submit. These circumstances need to be considered when assessing the viability of the tender. Tenderers are advised within the tender documentation provided to them to seek independent financial and legal advice prior to submitting a tender. References are also made to various Federal and State awards to assist the contractor determine their tender price.</para>
<para>Consideration is given to the total price of the tender as well as the various cost components that make up the tender. Tenderers control the allocation of costs according to their circumstances and/or financial advice. On occasions, some contractors only submit an overall price to perform the service and do not disclose their detailed cost components.</para>
<para>Tenderers may have other income sources such as operating as a Licensed Post Office, receiving a pension or may provide similar services such as a bus or a freight service that may directly affect how they price their tender for the service.</para>
<para>Australia Post as part of the tender assessment process will raise with the tenderer any areas of concern regarding the contractors pricing prior to accepting their offer. The final tender price and allocation of costs remains a decision for the tenderer. Australia Post may choose to award the tender where it is satisfied that the tenderer will be able to provide the service for the price tendered.</para>

Emissions from land systems are highly variable and, after extensive analysis, Australia chose not to elect the Article 3.4 activities mentioned above due to the risk of non-anthropogenic events which we have no control over (e.g. wildfire).</para>
<para class="block" pgwide="yes">If, however, in a post 2012 climate change agreement, land use, land-use change and forestry emissions sectors were to be listed in what is now Annex A of the Kyoto Protocol, all emissions from this sector would be included regardless (including Article 3.4 activities).</para>
<para class="block" pgwide="yes">The inclusion of Article 3.4 activities causes Australia’s national emissions to fluctuate between levels that would make it impossible to meet our international obligations.

<para>—The Minister for Agriculture, Fisheries and Forestry has provided the following answer to the honourable senator’s question:</para>
</talk.start>
<quote pgwide="yes">
<list type="decimal">
<item label="(1)">
<para>Yes—Following consideration of approaches relating to the formation of a National Genetics Resources Centre (NGRC), the Industries Development Committee (IDC) of the Primary Industries Standing Committee (PISC), at its last meeting (December 2008), referred the issue of nationally managing our agricultural plant genetic resources to the Primary Industries Ministerial Council (PIMC). This issue is to be considered within the context of the National Research, Development and Extension (RD&amp;E) Framework (a collaborative effort involving the agricultural industry, state and Commonwealth governments). This was further to agreement at PIMC 10 (April 2006) to recommendations in relation to strategic goals for a NGRC and endorsement at PIMC 11 (November 2006) of an NGRC Statement of Strategic Intent. A broad approach to funding was agreed to in 2007 by the PISC and specific funding arrangements and timeframes for the NGRC are matters requiring further consideration.</para>
<para>All Australian and State/Territory (and New Zealand) government ministers responsible for agriculture, food, fibre, forestry, fisheries and aquaculture industries/production and rural adjustment policy are members of the PIMC, and its operational arrangements are consistent with the Protocols and General Principles for the Operation of Ministerial Councils agreed by the Council of Australian Governments (COAG) in June 2001.</para>
</item>
<item label="(2)">
<para>There is no formal national guideline. A national policy on genetic resources is being progressed through PIMC and PISC.</para>
</item>
<item label="(3)">
<para>Following Australia’s signing of the International Treaty on Plant Genetic Resources for Food and Agriculture in 2002 and ratification of the Treaty in 2005, in November 2005, the then Australian Government announced that the National Genetics Resources Centre (NGRC) would be set up to coordinate Australian-based collections and to improve their content and long-term efficiency. The establishment of the NGRC is being progressed by the PISC, reporting to the PIMC.</para>
</item>
<item label="(4)">
<para>The major Australian ex situ collections of plant genetic resources for food and agriculture (PGRFA) are managed by the states. These collections are largely organised around the major crops and pastures grown in Australia. The Australian Winter Cereals Collection at Tamworth holds large numbers of accessions (an individual sample of seeds or plants entered into a collection) of winter cereals such as wheat, barley and oats. The Australian Tropical Crops and Forages Collection in Biloela, houses large numbers of tropical crops and forages including sorghum, rice and mungbean. The other major seed banks are: the Australian Trifolium Genetic Resources Centre in Perth; the Australian Temperate Field Crop Collection in Horsham; and the Australian Medicago Genetic Resources Centre in Adelaide. There are other collections of PGRFA some of which hold accessions of Australian native species such those belonging to the citrus family.</para>
<para>The institutions catalogue and administer the scientific study of the material. These institutions underpin most plant improvement and new variety development by Australian plant breeders, including for the adaptation of crops and pastures to significant challenges such as climate change by regularly supplying essential genetic resources in the form of seeds. Programs to maintain the viability of the collections are central to the work and service delivery of institutions that hold resources as seeds.</para>
<para>Institutions conduct on-site pest management and deposit samples of accessions in off-site back up facilities to manage threats to the collection from fire or other catastrophic event. The Environment Protection and Biodiversity Conservation Act 1999 (the EPBC Act) provides systems to protect any native PGRFA should it become threatened in situ.</para>
<para>These collections will form the basis of any material placed into the multilateral system (MLS) of the International Treaty on Plant Genetic Resources for Food and Agriculture (the Treaty) and their maintenance and documentation status will facilitate their effective integration into it. The PIMC is considering arrangements for the formation of the NGRC which is expected to deliver the necessary mechanisms to deal effectively with the requirements of the Treaty.</para>
</item>
<item label="(5)">
<para>The PISC IDC has referred progression of the NGRC to PIMC for consideration under the National RD&amp;E Framework.</para>
</item>
<item label="(6)">
<para>The state collections of relevant PGRFA have not been placed under the auspices of the Treaty. The Commonwealth does not have any relevant collections. The formation of the NGRC is expected to provide a national focal point for Australia’s plant genetic resource collections and a means to allow facilitated access through the MLS of the Treaty to the collections and associated information.</para>
</item>
<item label="(7)">
<para>Intellectual Property (IP) can be an invention, trade mark, original design or the practical application of a good idea. Confidential information (also referred to as trade secrets), patents, registered designs, trade marks, copyright, circuit layout rights and plant breeder's rights (PBR) are all legally classified as IP rights. The type of IP rights applied to plant genetic resources are most likely to be patents and PBR. In both cases, these IP rights need to be actively sought, are not automatic and any rights granted are restricted to the national jurisdiction in which they were granted. For these reasons, the Commonwealth or the states can not clarify, a priori, the IP status of indigenous wild species of citrus, mungbean, rice and sorghum.</para>
</item>
<item label="(8)">
<para>Officially, no governments of countries have approached the Australian Government over the past 16 years seeking access to Australia’s agricultural plant genetic resources. However, Australia’s state-run plant genetic resources centres holding PGRFA have received many thousands of applications for access to material directly from plant breeders and private and/or public agricultural institutions overseas.</para>
</item>
<item label="(9)">
<para>Optimal use and markets for wild plant species are determined by a range of interacting stakeholders, such as researchers, plant breeders, R&amp;D decision-makers, farmers, and commercial markets. As such, it is a complex issue with no single optimum. Native plants have significant potential as a source of useful traits to help farmers meet the challenges of climate change, pests and disease, sustainability, and improved nutrition. Such genetic resources need to be accessible and further explored for the development of new varieties for agriculture.</para>

<para>For the first time in 2008, students in Years 3, 5, 7 and 9 across Australia were tested in grammar and punctuation. It is expected that the reporting of student achievement in grammar and punctuation will encourage state and territory education authorities to pursue improvement in this important area of literacy.</para>
<para>The 2008/09 Budget announced funding of $577.4 million over four years to deliver a National Action Plan for Literacy and Numeracy to improve literacy and numeracy outcomes. The centrepiece of this funding is a National Partnership Agreement on Literacy and Numeracy which will provide states and territories with access to $500 million to advance the teaching of literacy and numeracy using evidence-based approaches. Under the Plan, the Australian Government will also invest $30 million to trial 29 innovative and evidence-based approaches to teaching literacy and numeracy and invest $40 million in strategic projects that support literacy and numeracy reform.</para>
<para>In addition, the interim National Curriculum Board has been charged with developing a single, world-class national curriculum for all Australian students from kindergarten to Year 12, starting with the key learning areas of English, mathematics, the sciences and history. The development of a continuum of learning in literacy and numeracy skills, ranging from basic competence in the early years through to the advancement and extension of these skills in the middle and later years of schooling, will be a foundation of the national curriculum.</para>

<para>The information on the Department’s website was out of date and has been updated. The definition of prohibited content for overseas hosted content changed from being RC and X only, to including R18+ where not behind an age verification scheme, and MA15+ where commercially available and not behind an age verification scheme, on the 20 January 2008 after legislation that was passed on 20 July 2007 by the Howard Government came into effect.</para>

<item label="(2)">
<para>In the year ended 30 June 2008, 14 items of online content were classified by the Classification Board in response to applications from ACMA. In addition, 778 items of overseas-hosted content were assessed by trained ACMA content assessors and found to be potential prohibited content (that is, prohibited content if formally classified by the Classification Board). Of the 1,122 complaints about online content received by ACMA during the period, 293 related to online content which ACMA assessed as not prohibited.</para>
<para>ACMA content assessors have been members of the Classification Board and/or undergo formal training provided by the Classification Board. ACMA employs a number of former National Classification Board members within the Codes, Content and Education Branch who have a combined experience of close to 20 years at the Classification Board. This experience in conjunction with the formal training and regular referrals of content to the Classification Board help ensure consistency of classification decisions.</para>

<para>Australian governments have committed to a set of targets to decrease Indigenous disadvantage. The Closing the Gap targets include two targets directly relating to educational outcomes at school:</para>

<list type="unadorned">
<item label="">
<para>Across Australia the performance of Indigenous students, particularly those in remote and very remote areas, against the National Benchmark results in reading, writing and numeracy has been well below that of other students. The gap in attainment of the benchmarks between Indigenous students in very remote areas of the Northern Territory and other students, both Indigenous and all, through the rest of the Northern Territory is also very wide. In 2007 the percentage of Indigenous students in very remote areas in the Northern Territory achieving the reading, writing and numeracy benchmarks ranged between five percent for Year 7 writing to 40.2 percent for Year 3 numeracy. In comparison the results for all students in very remote areas in the Northern Territory ranged between 27.3 percent for Year 5 writing and 52.4 percent in Year 3 numeracy.</para>
</item>
<item label="">
<para>One method of addressing this gap, as part of a coordinated approach to accelerating improvements in literacy and numeracy, is to improve the English language skills of Indigenous students from an early age.</para>
</item>
<item label="">
<para>The Government firmly believes that all Australian students need to be proficient in English to be able to fully participate in the world of work and further study. The Australian Government is committed to supporting languages education in Australian schools including indigenous languages.</para>
</item>
<item label="">
<para>(2)   The report <inline font-style="italic">Indigenous Languages and Culture in Northern Territory Schools Report 2005-2005</inline>, published by the Northern Territory Department of Employment, Education and Training, did not undertake a full evaluation of bilingual education. While the report states that preliminary and provisional data confirms that students participating in bilingual programs have marginally better results than students in similar non-bilingual schools it also notes that the numbers are not statistically valid and the impact of greater resourcing and teaching staff in the bilingual schools is not taken into account.</para>
</item>
<item label="">
<para>(3)   The Australian Government will continue to support Indigenous language programs in schools in recognition of the importance of obtaining equitable educational outcomes by Indigenous people through the maintenance and continued use of Indigenous languages. Through the MCEETYA Indigenous Reference Group, Ministers have agreed to develop and fully implement by 2012, educational programs for Indigenous children that respect and value Indigenous cultures, languages, and contexts and explicitly teach standard Australian English.</para>

<para>(4)   The Government is committed to the development of a rigorous and world-class national curriculum from kindergarten to year 12.</para>
</item>
<item label="">
<para>The national curriculum will provide a clear and explicit agreement about the curriculum essentials that all young Australians should have access to regardless of their socio-economic background or the location of their school. There will be flexibility for education authorities to continue to deliver alternative education programs that respond to local and regional circumstances whilst also delivering the national curriculum.</para>

<para>—The following answer has been provided by the Minister for Foreign Affairs to the honourable senator’s question:</para>
</talk.start>
<quote pgwide="yes">
<para class="block" pgwide="yes">The Australian Government strongly supports United Nations (UN) action to address the situation in Zimbabwe. In July 2008 Australia co-sponsored a draft UN Security Council (SC) resolution imposing international sanctions against the Mugabe regime. This draft resolution was vetoed by two permanent members. The Minister for Foreign Affairs welcomed further consideration of Zimbabwe by the UNSC in December 2008, and urged the Council to continue to sustain its interest in the crisis.</para>
<para class="block" pgwide="yes">In the absence of UNSC-mandated sanctions, the Australian Government tightened Australia’s sanctions against Zimbabwe in December 2008. These measures now impose travel and financial restrictions against 254 members of the Mugabe regime and four companies.</para>
<para class="block" pgwide="yes">The Australian Government continues to support UN humanitarian efforts in Zimbabwe. Since March 2008, Australia has contributed over $20 million to the UN World Food Programme’s current Protracted Relief and Recovery operation for Zimbabwe. In December 2008, Australia provided $800,000 to UNICEF to meet the immediate needs of women and children affected by Zimbabwe’s cholera epidemic.</para>
<para class="block" pgwide="yes">The Government would support a military intervention in Zimbabwe were such action proposed and endorsed by the UNSC under the UN Charter. Such military intervention would need to be based on an overwhelming assessment that proposed military action would alleviate the suffering of the Zimbabwean population as a whole, and that the risks to the population attendant on military action could be addressed effectively. UN authorisation for military intervention in Zimbabwe is not expected in the near future, primarily due to continuing efforts by the UN, the African Union and the Southern African Development Community to find a political solution, and the reluctance of some members of the Security Council to support military action.</para>
<para class="block" pgwide="yes">The Australian Government strongly supports UN action to address the situation in the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC) and has welcomed efforts by UN Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon and his Special Envoy, former Nigerian President Olusegun Obasanjo, to broker a peaceful settlement between the parties to the conflict.</para>
<para class="block" pgwide="yes">The Government welcomed the announcement by the UNSC on 20 November 2008 that the UN peace keeping mission in the DRC (MONUC) would be reinforced by an additional 3,000 personnel. Australia contributed US$14.5 million to MONUC in 2007-08, and has provided US$10.2 million so far this financial year.</para>
<para class="block" pgwide="yes">On 1 December 2008, the UN Human Rights Council adopted a resolution condemning human rights abuses in the DRC, particularly sexual violence and use of child soldiers, and emphasising the primary responsibility of the DRC Government to protect its people. Australia co-sponsored convening of the meeting, and made a statement expressing concern at the humanitarian crisis and support for the work of MONUC.</para>
<para class="block" pgwide="yes">Australia has pledged $5 million in emergency humanitarian assistance since early November 2008 for the people affected by the current fighting. Of these funds, $4 million was provided to UN agencies including the World Health Organization, UNICEF, the UN High Commissioner for Refugees and the UN Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs.</para>

<para>Given the estimated $800 million in additional infrastructure investment required by Inpex Corporation as a result of the decision to process gas from the Browse Basin’s Ichthys gas field in Darwin rather than in Western Australia: (a) what will be the delay in commencement of Petroleum Resource Rent Tax payments from the Ichthys gas field as a result of this additional capital expenditure; and (b) what is the potential impact on Commonwealth revenue as a result of reduced petroleum resource rent tax flowing from the increase in project capital costs.</para>

<para>Given the media release by the Minister on 26 September 2008 which stated that, ‘The Australian Government is pleased Inpex has taken the decision today on a site in Darwin for its proposed LNG plant utilising gas from the Ichthys gas field in Western Australia’, did the Minister consider the reduced returns for the community through Commonwealth royalties from this project; if so, did the Minister take all possible steps to maximise returns to the community by attempting to ensure that the processing of the Ichthys gas field took place in Western Australia; if not, why did the Minister fail to assess the return to the community of a major development project which he travelled to Darwin to announce.</para>

<quote pgwide="yes">
<list type="decimal">
<item label="(1)">
<para>It is not possible to estimate delays or impacts on Petroleum Resource Rent Tax (PRRT) payments which may arise from the decision by the Ichthys joint venture partners (INPEX and Total) to locate its Ichthys LNG project in Darwin rather than in Western Australia. PRRT payments are affected by a wide range of variables. Producing such an estimate would require a detailed knowledge of the cost structure of both options for the LNG project and an accurate forecast of future spending and revenue, with revenue essentially being dependent on the oil price. Government, as a matter of course, is not privy to this level of commercial information from a project proponent in making commercial decisions on developments of this nature.</para>
</item>
<item label="(2)">
<para>The decision making process undertaken for the type of major project represented by the Ichthys Project is complex and influenced by a range of factors and project risks. The entire Australian community benefits from project proponents making appropriate commercial decisions on project developments within a rigorous legal and regulatory framework. The Australian Government does not propose to direct project proponents in making these decisions.</para>
