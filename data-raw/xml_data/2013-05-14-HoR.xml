                      <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Mr DUTTON</span>
                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Dickson</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">12:03</span>):  I rise to speak on the Aged Care (Living Longer Living Better) Bill 2013 and the related bills. For the many of us who have had a relative requiring care, the experience can be a daunting and at times personally distressing experience. Irrespective of their financial position, our grandfather, grandmother, mother or father deserve respect, dignity and quality in their senior years. As family members we want to know what options are available for our loved ones. The simpler the system is to navigate, the better for all concerned. There should be opportunities for appropriate care in the home. Understandably, so many want to stay in the surroundings they love and that are familiar to them and their family. If they require residential care—low or high care—there should be options readily available, preferably in their local community.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I do respect the intent of aspects of the reforms that have been proposed. We know that there are many, many challenges ahead and the proportion of the population over 70 years of age is expected to double over future decades. The incidence of chronic disease continues to grow rapidly. One million Australians receive aged-care services subsidised by the Commonwealth, and that is expected to more than double by 2050. Despite this, the government's approach to aged care and much promised reform has been protracted to say the least. The government announced the Productivity Commission's terms of reference almost three years ago. The draft report was released in January 2011, and the final report was provided to the government in June of that year. The minister and Prime Minister did not publicly release the report until August 2011, and it took a further 250 days to respond to the PC's recommendations in the form of the Living Longer Living Better policy.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The government trumpeted the release on the day as a revolution for the sector. The government continues to claim that this policy is a $3.7 billion investment when it is not. Not surprisingly, stakeholders were initially enthusiastic given the flashy headlines. Looking at the finer detail, the proposals are nowhere near as ambitious as first made out. That has been a current theme across the last six years under the stewardship of this government. The government is saving over $560 million through means testing, and they include that as part of the so-called $3.7 billion investment. Over $2½ billion is being redirected from existing programs, including $1.6 billion from the Aged Care Funding Instrument. Places and funding are to be transferred from residential care to home care, and funding will be cut from the Long Stay Older Patients initiative. The net investment over four years is just $284.6 million, not $3.7 billion. In fact, it is less than one per cent of the existing aged-care budget over the forward estimates. The unanticipated changes to ACFI and how they are applied have reduced confidence in a sector already struggling to break even.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">It is, to say the least, a ham-fisted and counterproductive way to initiate reforms. In the few months following the policy's release, $3.5 billion of capital projects were found to be in jeopardy as a result of the uncertainty caused. In fact, independent analysis undertaken by the Centre for International Economics for Leading Age Services Australia found a revenue black hole of more than $750 million for providers due to the ACFI cuts. The average reduction for each affected resident is estimated at between $20,000 and $30,000 in care funding every year. This corresponds with what we are hearing from providers, and it is particularly hard on the smaller operators and those in regional and rural areas.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The minister has implied that there has been rorting and 'unusual claiming'. However, at Senate estimates it was confirmed that there has not been a single prosecution in the last five years. The sector is crying out for incentives to invest in new capital to open new beds. The government's actions so far appear to have had the opposite effect. The other significant aspect, recently launched by the government, is the workforce compact. This complex arrangement appears to be linked to the funding lost through the ACFI changes. Under the compact, providers with 50 beds or more must have an enterprise bargaining agreement to receive that funding. Those with fewer than 50 beds do not require an EBA but must still comply with the compact obligations to access funding. In itself, this will impose further cost pressures, again particularly affecting smaller providers in rural and regional areas. Providers unable to comply with these requirements will not be able to access the funding.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Across the sector there is recognition that the hardworking staff in aged care need to be paid well for the demanding and important work they perform, but this proposal, certainly by any objective analysis, seems more about propping up the beleaguered HSU than about genuinely helping the workers, those in care or, indeed, the providers.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The bills before the parliament today enacting the government's Living Longer Living Better policy reflect a small hit-and-miss selection of the Productivity Commission's recommendations. Specifically, the bills: (1) remove the distinction between low-level and high-level residential care; (2) provide a new means test combining income and assets tests and new annual and lifetime caps on means tested care fees; (3) allow accommodation costs to be paid through a refundable lump sum, a rental periodic style supplement or combination; (4) make changes to home care, including requiring contributions for people that enter home care on or after 1 July 2014; (5) establish a new aged-care pricing commissioner; (6) extend the operation of the accommodation bond guarantee scheme to new bond arrangements reflected in the government's reforms; and, finally, establish the new Australian Aged Care Quality Agency to replace the Aged Care Standards and Accreditation Agency from 1 January 2014.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The Aged Care (Living Longer Living Better) Bill 2013 removes the distinction between low care and high care, which is intended to provide one approval process for residential care. It is argued by the minister that this will reduce reassessments and allow individuals requiring a permanent residential care place to access services according to need. The bill proposes changes to the residential care subsidies and fees for residents who enter care on or after 1 July 2014. This includes a new means test combining income and asset tests and new annual and lifetime caps on means tested care fees. As stated in the minister's second reading speech an annual cap of $25,000 will apply for means tested fees, with a lifetime cap of $60,000. Both are to be indexed. Any contribution does require an appropriate safety net. We do not want a situation where people are precluded from necessary care because of what they are required to pay. It is appropriate that the proposed contributions and respective caps are examined as part of the Senate inquiry.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I recognise that there is a delicate balance between funding quality care, ensuring affordability of care and the sustainability of the system overall. In relation to accommodation costs the bill will allow fees to be paid through a refundable lump sum, or a rental periodic-style supplement, or a combination of the two. It is stated that aged care providers will not be able to distinguish between care recipients based on means of payment. Clause 52G(3) provides that the minister may by legislative instrument determine the maximum amount of accommodation that an approved provider may charge, including the maximum daily accommodation payment amount and the method for working out the refundable accommodation deposit. The bill also proposes a new form of home care to replace community aged care packages, extended aged care at home and dementia packages. An income tested care fee will apply to home care for all except pensioners. This again will be capped by year and by lifetime.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The Aged Care Pricing Commissioner is also established for the stated purpose of making decisions on pricing issues. The functions of the commissioner are as follows: to approve extra service fees; to approve accommodation payments that are higher than the maximum amount of accommodation payment determined by the minister; and other functions as determined by other acts or by the minister by determination. Whilst I acknowledge that there are lead times for these changes, the independent review proposed in the legislation is not to commence until 2016 and will not report to parliament until 30 June 2017.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The two bond security amendment bills extend the operation of the Accommodation Bond Guarantee Scheme to new accommodation payment arrangements. The Australian Bond Guarantee Scheme, prescribed in the 2006 act, provides a mechanism by which the Commonwealth may repay outstanding bond balances to care recipients should a provider become insolvent or be unable to refund the balances. There is also the capacity for the Commonwealth to recover the cost of refunding these bonds which is amended through the relevant act to reflect the changes to accommodation payments.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The Australian Aged Care Quality Agency Bill 2013 establishes a new agency. This is to replace the Aged Care Standards and Accreditation Agency from January next year. Aged care providers will be responsible to it for quality assurance of aged care services delivered in the home or a residential facility. The functions of the new agency are as follows: accrediting residential care facilities; conducting quality reviews of home care services; promoting high quality care, innovation and continuous improvement amongst approved providers of aged care; and providing information, education and training to approved providers of aged care.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I am yet to be convinced that red tape in what is already a highly regulated sector has been appropriately streamlined or that it has even been genuinely a priority for the government in this process. I do support high standards and efficient regulation to ensure consistent, quality services for the many vulnerable people in care, but nothing is achieved by unnecessary red tape except a diversion of much needed resources away from those most in need. If we want an innovative and efficient sector, unnecessary red tape cannot be ignored.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The related Australian Aged Care Quality Agency (Transitional Provisions) Bill 2013 enables the transfer of assets and liabilities from the Aged Care Standards and Accreditation Agency Ltd to the Commonwealth to facilitate the establishment of the new agency. Over $20 million was included in the budget for the Aged Care Financing Authority and over $14 million for the Aged Care Reform Implementation Council. About half the council's budget is for communications. The financing authority's role will be to provide independent advice on pricing and financing issues. It will make recommendations about subsidies and payments. It will also approve higher fees for accommodation and extra services not covered by subsidies. While there may be good intent and while we do not disagree with some of the functions performed, there has been a proliferation of separate bureaucratic structures under this government; in fact, it is a hallmark of this government. We believe more focus should be on the resources for front-line services and reducing where possible costly bureaucracy.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The government's time lines are peculiar on these bills. Despite years of deliberation, the bills were only introduced in the last sitting period, and the minister has said that they should be passed immediately. The government has set the snail pace of these reforms to date. The government has not brought the bills on for debate until today. I am not sure why or how procedurally the minister was expecting to ram the bills through the parliament. This is far from what should be normal process.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The coalition is keen to support good reform in this important area. Disappointingly for some, the reforms proposed fall very well short of what was promised. The House should remember that this is the minister who is responsible for delivering 16 early psychosis prevention and intervention centres, yet since 2010, when that promise was made, a grand total of zero of the 16 has been delivered. This is despite the Prime Minister herself saying: </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">I want to be absolutely clear—mental health will be a second term priority for this Government.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Those people right across the Australian community in the mental health sector, those people who access services provided by mental health providers or, indeed, those people in the aged-care sector can add that quote from the Prime Minister to the long list of broken promises that has come to plague this government. For the aged-care sector, this is not a good track record, and it comes on the back of so many other implementation blunders across the rest of government.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The bills have rightly been referred to a Senate inquiry, and the coalition will carefully consider the findings and the submissions. A number of changes will be enacted by regulation rather than legislation, and some of that detail is yet to be provided and will also require responsible scrutiny. This House should have the opportunity to properly consider any complex changes to aged care. The Senate inquiry provides that opportunity. We need to ensure that we can at least achieve the best outcome from what is before us.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">In closing, I want to say to the many providers that I have spoken to around the country, particularly regional providers, that we hear their concerns. We do share their view that this minister has a tin ear when it comes to the concerns that they have raised either with the government or through the peak bodies about some of the sections within this act. It is exactly the reason that we set up the Senate inquiry and asked for people across the sector to provide input so that we can improve this legislation. As I say, the time lines on this legislation have been protracted. It has gone on for the last six years. It is interesting to note that out of the billions of dollars that this government wasted in its response to the GFC not one dollar was spent on aged care: no money for additional infrastructure or for providers, no money in wage compacts, no money for patients and services provided to the clients and residents within aged-care facilities—not a dollar.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This government came into power in 2007 promising that it would reform the aged-care sector. This minister has only been in the portfolio since the second half of these six years of the disastrous Rudd-Gillard government, but the dysfunction has continued up until this very day, and we are seeing it play out in this bill. We all want to see a better outcome for older Australians in terms of their interaction with the aged-care system, and the coalition is committed to trying to resolve some of those outstanding issues. We wanted to entertain consideration of this bill, but we also wanted to ask for providers, for care givers, for people of good intent to come forward to that Senate inquiry to make sure that their detail was provided, that their concerns were aired, and we expected that the government would listen to some of those concerns. This is a government that cannot be trusted. It says, 'Trust us in the detail; we've got the bare bones of the legislation now and we'll rush all of the other detail through in another process,' but this government cannot be trusted.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The Treasurer will deliver the speech tonight that people are anticipating will chart some way forward from the disaster of the last five or six years, but people will not get the outcome that they want from this Treasurer, they will not get the outcome that they want from this government, because that has been the track record over the last six years. Because of this government's dysfunction, because of distractions with leadership, because it has promised surpluses and then failed to deliver them, because it has spent money and run us into enormous debt, it is unfortunate that people who are looking for aged care-services in our country today have suffered because of that distraction. They have suffered because this government decided that aged care was not a priority for the Rudd government and it has not been a priority for the Gillard government.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I think the responsible course of action for this government to take would be to listen to the concerns of those who raised them, quite rightly, in the Senate process and to look at sensible amendments that could be proposed to try and improve this bill. As a parting gesture to the Australian people, with only a few months to go before the next election, in the dying days of the Gillard government, please listen to those concerns of the aged-care sector, of the aged-care providers and the people who seek care and are being cared for in these facilities around the country. Listen to the expertise that they bring to the table. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Listen to their concerns about this compact. They do not want to feather the lifestyle of people like Craig Thomson who now occupy the upper echelons of the HSU. That is what this bill provides: it is taking money away from one part of the aged-care sector and seeing it, at least in part, dispersed back through the HSU. The HSU is a disgraced union body in this country. The member for Dobell, I note, has just been told that he cannot run again for the Labor Party—three months before the election. It is absolute contempt that the Labor Party has for the people in the seat of Dobell and, indeed, that through his own actions he has.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This bill seeks to confer an ultimate benefit on the HSU. People are asking why is that the case, why divert money away from aged care and impose another cost burden on aged-care providers in terms of having to engage with the HSU? Why do they need to do that? I will tell you why: because they decide the preselections of people who sit on this government bench. They decide the preselections of people like Craig Thomson and others who come into this parliament and ultimately decide whether or not they will direct their backbenchers, and frontbenchers, to vote for Julia Gillard or Wayne Swan or Kevin Rudd or Bill Shorten or Mark Butler or—</span>

                    </a>  whoever it is, Madam Speaker, that seeks leadership of the ALP. That, when you cut it all down, is what a significant part of this bill is all about. And that is why the Australian public continue to express disgust in this government.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">They cannot sort out their own internal issues and therefore those in the aged-care sector have suffered. They do not want to listen to the outcome of the Senate inquiry because essentially all they have sought to deliver through this bill is not reform to the aged-care sector but a blank cheque to the HSU and to the other unions involved. That will be an albatross around this minister's neck. This minister will seek leadership of the Labor Party at some point into the future—I am sure he will; he is an ambitious person.</span>

                    </a>  For a long time, Madam Speaker, this minister has fooled the industry, but I find as I move around the country talking to providers that they are now starting to see through all of the smoke and mirrors. They are now starting to see this bill for what it is. It is not about a reform of the aged-care sector. If they were serious about doing that they would have done it five or six years ago. They would have applied at least one dollar of the billions of dollars they wasted to the aged-care sector to help build infrastructure and to make it more affordable for people on low incomes to go into aged care, but they sought to do none of that. They pushed it off to the Productivity Commission to try to get through the last election. Then, when they had the Productivity Commission recommendations, they sat on them and pushed them aside because they had run out of money. That is what happened with this government's approach to aged care. Then they tried to pretend that they had some $3.7 billion huge investment, but when you strip it down it is a net extra spend of $250 million over that four-year period and a shameful exercise in deception by this government and by this minister. They need to be called for it.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">So what have we done? We have tried to engage constructively with the sector to work out how this bad bill could be improved. What could be changed to improve the situation for aged care in this country? How could we make it easier for people to find their way through the mess of aged care and find a place for that grandmother, grandfather, mother, father or loved one? That is what we sought to do through the Senate inquiry process, and yet what does this minister do? This minister says, 'We are going to ignore that Senate inquiry process, we are not going to listen to the recommendations of the sector, we are not going to listen to people of good will who sought to make this bill better; we just want to deliver for the HSU.' That is really the only objective that the government seeks in this bill. They want to make sure that they repay a dividend to their union bosses, and that really sums up what this whole sad, six-year period in our country's history is about.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This is what it amounts to. The puppeteers have pulled the strings for the last six years, and we have seen it play out through leadership changes which have impacted on the government's desire in this area. This is the point. This government has been distracted by its own leadership deliberations, by the knifing of Kevin Rudd and by the proposed resurrection of Kevin Rudd—not to be. This government, whilst it has been distracted by that, has not concentrated on aged care or the millions of Australians in the future who will seek aged-care services for their loved ones. The government brings this bill in at the eleventh hour of this dying government because they seek to repay a dividend to those union bosses who supported their entry into this place.

                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Hindmarsh</span>—<span class="HPS-MinisterialTitles">Second Deputy Speaker</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">12:28</span>):  I am very pleased and very honoured to speak on the Aged Care (Living Longer Living Better) Bill 2013 today, because this bill delivers security, certainty and fairness for millions of older Australians. It delivers fairer and more flexible arrangements for people looking to stay at home or to move into aged care. This bill is very important to me and to many of my constituents. As I have said many times in this place, the electorate of Hindmarsh has one of the oldest demographics in the country. Twenty per cent of the residents of Hindmarsh are age 65 and over. Many say it is the oldest electorate in the country; I like to say it is the wisest electorate in the country, because with age comes wisdom, and I have benefited greatly from the many older constituents in my electorate.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">In my electorate, there are an extra 870 high-care places and 968 low places thanks to the extra funding in 2010 and 2011. On 20 April 2012 we heard the minister announce the $3.7 billion for the Living Longer, Living Better aged care reform. That is a huge increase, and what it means is that people are being looked after when they need to be. As we have heard, many of these people have worked all their lives and paid their taxes. Many have fought in wars. They deserve the best treatment and care that we can possibly give. These people have contributed so much to this wonderful nation. They built the foundations that have allowed us to prosper.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">There are a lot of wonderful facilities in and around my electorate that are providing these new places and they deserve, very quickly, due credit for their hard work in this process. They include places like St Hilarion, an Italian nursing home that looks after many more people than just Australians with Italian backgrounds; the ECH; Southern Cross; Masonic Homes; St Basil's; St Martin's; Kilparrin Nursing Home; and the Ridleyton Greek Home for the Aged. All of them do a wonderful job in caring for and looking after those in need in their old age. In addition, I would like to thank the tireless efforts of the staff from each facility who look after those residents to ensure that their lives are happy and comfortable.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This government has also delivered 475 community aged packages in my electorate of Hindmarsh. This is in addition to the 54 extended aged-care at home packages and 20 extended aged-care at home dementia packages. We know how important it is for people to be able to stay in their homes. When you speak to people in my electorate, the majority say that they wish to stay in their homes and be cared for there. These extra packages are very beneficial.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The committee that I currently sit on recently finished an inquiry into dementia and how as a nation we can best care for people living with this condition. Australia is a wealthy nation and Australians are living longer. It is fantastic that we are living longer. Medical breakthroughs allow us to live longer. They allow our bodies to keep going and to keep supporting us for many more years than people in the past. Medical breakthroughs have been good for us. But there is another story. People with dementia are unfortunately growing in numbers. We know that by 2050 the number of Australians with dementia will quadruple. We will have quite an epidemic on our hands unless we do things now to put things in place to look after those people.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We know that not everyone is going to need aged care when they get older. In fact, we would all probably—as I said earlier—prefer to stay home and have the care required to look after us offered there. That is why the government also gave over $3 million in 2011-12 to centres in my electorate for day therapy. Day therapy gives older people the chance to come along and take part in activities away from home. This is a big thing. When you get older, you may lose some mobility and confidence. Having support so that you can get out to one of these day centres is a great thing.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This bill also addresses some of the issues facing those who care for our older Australians. Aged-care workers are some of the lowest-paid workers in Australia. They perform the vital task of looking after our parents, our grandparents and our great-grandparents—the older Australians in our community. We know that most Australians who pursue a career in aged care do it for much more than the financial reward. But pay rises are a big incentive to work in this growing industry. With the aged-care workforce needing to almost triple in size by 2050 to support our ageing population, we need to act now to attract and retain aged-care workers.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">That is all part of the Living Longer, Living Better aged-care reforms. The Australian government announced that up to $1.2 billion will be provided to address the workforce pressures. We know that the current workforce is one of the oldest workforces. That is what the demographics of the aged-care workforce in Australia tell us.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Funding will flow through from July by way of a workforce supplement, delivering pay rises for aged-care nurses, care workers and others in the aged-care industry who look after older Australians. An additional one per cent pay rise will be available, above minimum annual wage increases or other wage rises which are negotiated through enterprise bargaining agreements, for workers who are employed by aged-care providers who meet the requirements of a workforce compact.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">What does that mean? A personal care worker, who is currently paid the award rate and who is employed by an aged-care provider who meets those requirements would, effectively, see a pay rise close to 18 per cent over four years. Enrolled nurses will receive 25 per cent higher pay and registered nurses close to 30 per cent, in the same situation.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The second part of the Addressing Workplace Pressures initiative is the Aged Care Workforce Development Plan, which will begin in mid-2013. An expert advisory group will be established to focus on better ways to support the aged-care workforce. This group will seek to ensure that, on top of wage increases, those aged-care workers get benefits, including improved career structures; better training and education; and better work practices, including lowering the high rate of workplace injuries in aged care.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The workforce supplement is part of the Addressing Workforce Pressures initiative, which will be delivered in two parts through the aged-care workforce compact and through the Aged Care Workforce Development Plan. These are very important initiatives. As I get around in my electorate and talk to aged-care providers, one of the biggest issues they raise is maintaining and retaining the workforce required to look after older Australians in their facilities.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Another big and fairly complex issue in my electorate is multicultural aged care. The Australian government is committed to ensuring equitable access to high-quality, culturally-appropriate aged care for all people from culturally and linguistically diverse backgrounds. As I said, this is extremely important for my electorate because I have a very high number of Greek Australians and Italian Australians who migrated here in the fifties and sixties, all as young men and women, perhaps in their 20s, perhaps even in their teens or late 20s, who today are the fastest ageing Australians in my electorate. They are now at the stage where they are already needing services or are starting to need them. They are not the only ones. People from culturally and linguistically diverse backgrounds have specific needs that must be addressed. Those needs can be as basic as having familiar food available.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We know that when people develop, for example, dementia, nothing is worse than not being able to speak the language or know what people are saying to you. We know that many older Australians revert to their native tongue when they develop dementia. It might simply be a case of employing bilingual workers who can speak the language of the resident, make them feel comfortable so they feel they are being listened to. All these things are contained within the new strategy, which aims to ensure that aged care is inclusive of people from all backgrounds. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Initiatives outlined in the strategy also include a rolling review of the National Aged Care Advocacy Program, to include an emphasis on promoting, supporting and maximising access to advocacy for older people from culturally and linguistically diverse backgrounds, their families and their carers. It also includes ensuring that the Aged Care Complaints Scheme is promoted to those linguistically diverse background communities, including the use of interpreting and translating services, and working with the culturally and linguistic diverse background sector to provide the cultural competency training for promotion and incorporation into all aged-care services. It also includes developing structured pathways to facilitate the employment of appropriate bilingual staff in the aged-care system. There has been a lot of work going towards ensuring that we have in place a system that caters for all Australians, no matter where they come from or what their background is.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I am very proud of this bill and that is why I am supporting it. One day we as a nation will be judged on how we have looked after our elderly. As I said earlier, many of the people that we are talking about today have paid their taxes all their lives, have worked hard and have gone through wars just to ensure that the foundations of this country are steadfast so that we can live a better life than they did. I am proud to support this bill and I commend it to the House.</span>

                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Forrest</span>—<span class="HPS-MinisterialTitles">Opposition Whip</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">12:40</span>):  I support the amendments moved by the shadow minister, because we know that under this government the aged-care system in Australia is rapidly approaching crisis point, particularly if you live in an electorate like mine, which is a rural and regional one, or one of those that involve smaller providers. Prime examples are in Western Australia, where last year the federal government allocated 1,564 additional residential aged-care places to our state. However, only 314 of these beds were actually taken up—it is a great indication. In the preceding year, of the 1,208 beds on offer only 507, or 42 per cent, were taken up in WA. What is worse, over the last three years 786 bed licences, the licence that provides the funding for aged-care beds were handed back to the government—283 of those were from Western Australia. Now in WA we are some 2,400 beds short of our aged-care requirements. That is a lot of people in my state and in my part of the south-west.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The government has chosen not to fund aged care in the way it needs to. Instead, it has wasted billions of dollars on unrealistic dreams and schemes that often have turned out to be nothing less than a nightmare. This is a at time when the group referred to as the baby boomers, those born between 1946 and 1964, start to enter retirement—that section of our community who are now between 46 and 65 years old and are looking at their retirement and aged-care solutions. It also looks as though we will have to defend their superannuation savings from being grabbed by what is just an incredibly wasteful Labor government.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Around nine per cent of our population is aged 70 years or older. That is expected to rise to 13 per cent by 2021 and 20 per cent, around 5.7 million people, in 2051—and this government has sat on its hands. By 2050 over 3.5 million Australians are expected to use aged care each year. As we are ageing we are acquiring more complex healthcare conditions and changing disease patterns, resulting in increasing and changing aged-care needs. The challenges include a larger, increasingly culturally diverse, ageing population. I see that in my electorate.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The dependency ratio in 2007 was six people of working age for every person aged 67. By 2047 this will be almost halved, to 3.2 people of working age for every person aged over 67. So with fewer people generating taxation revenue, care options of concessional and assisted aged-care residents, those with the least resources, will be jeopardised. And at this crucial time, under a dysfunctional Labor government, the agenda in Australia has been to remove support for residential-aged-care provision and waste taxpayers funds hand over fist in so many ways.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The fact that we are debating this bill prior to an election shows that this government has not prioritised aged care at all. It is no wonder that residential aged-care providers are not taking up those bed licences. Despite promises of reform, five years on under this government there is very little actual change in the communities—my communities and your communities—where it is so desperately needed. We have seen the government undertake a litany of reports and reviews, including 20 reviews and three Productivity Commission reports. They were continually ignored. They were put off until now when here we are, just prior to election, discussing aged care. They were continually ignored or responded to with more inquiries without a decision being made or anything being done to secure aged care into the future. However, the bills only cherry-pick a few recommendations of the Productivity Commission report <span style="font-style:italic;">Caring for older Australians</span>, which brings us to the focus of the bill before the House today. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The government's changes to aged-care funding which came into effect on 1 July last year under the Living Longer Living Better program represent, in effect, a knife to the heart of small regional aged-care service providers. I know that because they have told me. When the Labor Party and the Labor government spruiked their plan as the panacea for our aged-care system, they deliberately failed to tell the Australian people that this program in fact claws back $750 million from the aged-care sector over the next 2½ years. The actual practical result, as opposed to the misrepresentations of the government, is that residential aged-care providers will receive less funding for new patients than they got for patients last year. That is what my aged-care providers are telling me. The 2012-13 budget alone will see $500 million of ACFI funding ripped out of a sector that is already under pressure. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Grant Thornton reported, in the <span style="font-style:italic;">Living Longer, Living Better reform report #2</span>, of June 2012:</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Small">In the last two months since the Government's reform announcements, over $3.5 billion in planned aged care development projects have been shelved.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">That is the actual result. A very frail elderly Australian entering aged care in the current year brings with them federal funding of around $56 to $63 a day less than a resident admitted in the last financial year. Given the average turnover rate in aged-care facilities of around 50 per cent per annum, by the end of the current financial year half of the residents will be supported at this new lower rate. One can only imagine what it is doing in the smaller facilities. I know you can well imagine it, Mr Deputy Speaker Scott. At the end of the next financial year, nearly all of the residents will be on the lower rate of funding. For a 40-bed unit, this would represent a loss of funding of close to half a million dollars by 2014-15. With only 40 per cent of residential aged-care providers operating in the black, I just wonder whether this government has been asleep in developing this policy and presenting it at this late date, so close to the election.</span>

                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Many aged-care providers in regional Australia are already losing money. The government members need to come out into the regional areas and see exactly what this is doing. Funding for residential aged care is managed under ACFI, the Aged Care Funding Instrument, in which levels of acuity—nil, low, medium and high—are assessed over a range of biological and behavioural factors determining the funding received. The factors are categorised as activities of daily living, behaviour and complex health care, and there are 12 in total. The levels are frequently reviewed in individual patients. In one case recently, from my electorate, the patient's level of acuity rose from low to medium in the behavioural section, due to deteriorating behaviour; however, the payments actually dropped by $18 a day. Astoundingly, as the need increased, the funding reduced. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Given the impending increase in aged-care needs bearing down on Australia in the form of our ageing population, this assault on the viability of residential aged-care providers is not acceptable or sustainable. A $56-a-day loss equates to $392 a week, or $20,440 a year, per patient. The onset of this issue will be insidious; it will be gradual, as more and more residents are turned over and lower payments become far more common. Crunch time will probably be at the end of the current financial year, when the new budgets for these providers are prepared. And if, as I heard, we are to be judged on how we treat our most vulnerable, the Labor government's new funding model is definitely a fail. This is why aged-care providers cannot afford the additional beds: they are already losing on each and every bed, so extra beds means greater losses. And that is why, of the 5,278 new residential aged-care places allocated to Western Australia since 2007, only 910, or 36 per cent, have been taken up, simply because they do not attract sufficient funding. Well, now they are going to attract even less. This government is making it even harder for our elderly by cutting support to the most needy and the most frail.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The other issue to be addressed in the government's changes is Labor's new agenda of interfering in management through the workplace supplement. In aged care the Labor government, as it has in childcare, has sought to enhance union control and government interference. It offers more money for wages, but receiving it can cost providers more than they actually receive. Aged and Community Services WA estimates that an aged-care provider who operates a small 31-bed regional facility would be eligible to receive $17,000 under the workforce supplement principles but in order to receive this would have to commit to an additional $30,000 in wages. That is a false economy—and a devious manipulation from a government becoming famous for such actions.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">At the last federal election the coalition outlined our plan for the first-ever four-year agreement, and we set out some areas that we believe ought to be included in any agreement. We are committed to the delivery of a high-quality, affordable and accessible aged-care scheme that meets the needs and the preferences of older Australians. Our goal has always been to provide the very best care, whether in the community or in residential care, and particularly for people in rural and regional areas like my own electorate. The fundamental work on the first-ever aged-care provider agreement is certainly going to be retained. I certainly support the amendments moved by the member for Dickson. And I would say to those members opposite who have not spent time discussing how Labor's policies are actually impacting smaller rural and regional providers that I strongly encourage you (1) not to have aged care as a last resort of this government just prior to an election and (2) to actually get out there and talk to them on the ground; go and talk to the people in my electorate this is affecting so badly—perhaps the people at Tuia Lodge in Donnybrook. I had a whole raft of different providers, not just from my electorate but from other electorates, come to visit me just to say how badly this is affecting them. They are concerned about their ongoing viability. They are desperate to be able to provide the supports and services the people in their care need, and they so desperately want to provide these supports and services. But the government is putting all of that at risk.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I know in talking not only to the providers but to the staff as well that they are very passionate about what they do; they are passionate about the people in their care. And I know that the people who live in those communities desperately want to be able to spend their last years in small facilities in their own communities, and that is the type of facility that is on offer out in our electorates. We need to work hard to make sure these providers are in a position to offer opportunities for people in those smaller communities to actually receive the aged care they need in their local community. So, on that basis, I support the amendments moved by the member for Dickson.</span>

                      <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Ms BRODTMANN</span>
                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Canberra</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">12:54</span>):  My electorate of Canberra is the largest by population in Australia, so I proudly represent a very large number of older Australians, older Canberrans and older people who look to government to help them make sure that as they live longer they also live better. There are more than 1,100 residents in mainstream residential aged-care facilities in my electorate and I have had the pleasure of visiting many of them. I have spent a lot of time talking with residents and staff and families. Most recently, last week, I was out at Brindabella Gardens visiting Eileen Pegrum, who turned 100 last week, and I am visiting a number of other people who are turning 100 throughout this year, Canberra's centenary year, to drop flowers off for them and take some cake and just catch up with them. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Just recently, I visited Alice Lukac at her home in Isaacs and I spent a wonderful morning with her family—her grandchildren, her daughter her granddaughter and her great granddaughters. They are very interested in education and it was wonderful not just talking to the family about their aspirations for education but also talking to this woman in the family home about her history. I visit many Canberrans throughout the course of my job every week, and it is a great pleasure in many ways to sit at their feet and just listen to the stories and the contributions they have made to Australia and, most importantly, to Canberra—people out at Araluen and St Andrews and Goodwin and Brindabella. I have also hosted a very well-attended aged-care forum with Minister Butler and I have taken the minister to meet with aged-care providers and residents around the electorate as well. He has always been very well received and has always listened very closely to the needs and the discussions with those residents, staff and families at those aged-care providers. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Canberra is fortunate to have so many quality aged-care providers and services; however, we all recognise that the system needs to be constantly improved to meet changing demands. The current aged-care system needs to be reformed to meet the needs of an ageing Australia, and that is what we are doing. I know that, when it comes to aged care, the preference is for people to stay in their family home for as long as possible. We all want to be able to age with dignity in our own home. But, when that is not possible, we all want to be assured that there are aged-care services offering certainty and stability and dignity.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I know, from speaking to the many people in my electorate in aged-care services and the providers, that there are three things of particular concern to my community. The first is the quality of care that is being provided in the aged-care sector, the second is the financial cost associated with aged care, and the third is being confident of access to the right information to make the right choices. I have no doubt that the legislation the government is introducing today will vastly improve the way aged care is delivered in Australia. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The government's $3.7 billion Living Longer Living Better reform package contains five bills that build on the Productivity Commission's recommendations. Many Canberrans who are involved in the aged-care sector made submissions to the Productivity Commission inquiry into caring for older Australians, and these bills represent Labor's plan for the future aged-care needs of all Australians. These are major reforms that will benefit both the key providers of aged-care services and those who need them.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Others will speak in more detail about the specifics contained in these bills, but I want to talk today about the positive impact these reforms will have in my electorate. These reforms will increase and improve the supply of aged-care services so that the sector can better address changes in demand. In a generation's time the population of people aged over 65 is expected to increase from about 3,000,000 to over 8,000,000. Labor recognises that current and future demographic changes are placing increasing pressures on the aged-care sector, which is why we are aiming to increase and improve the supply of services.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">In a growing electorate like Canberra, which also serves as a regional hub and provides care to many people living in the capital region, this is a significant and welcome reform. Labor understands that families and those receiving aged-care services want to have better information so they can have greater choice and greater control. That is why we have sat down with industry and with aged-care consumers and age-care workers to create these reforms. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">In all areas of health care, access to transparent information and choice is vital. Labor has initiated a raft of improvements for consumers in all areas of health care. Most importantly, empowering people to meet their aged-care and healthcare needs is at the centre of our reforms. I know these measures will be welcomed by aged-care providers and aged-care consumers.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">In my many visits to aged care homes and in my conversations with providers and residents, workforce issues are almost always raised with me. They are always, if not at the start of the conversation, in the middle of the conversation. They are up there. We must have a stable, skilled and dedicated workforce to deliver the reforms Labor is bringing about. These bills specifically address the workforce issues in aged care with measures to attract and retain a skilled and capable workforce. There is up to $1.2 billion in funding to address workplace pressures.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I note that the Minister for Mental Health and Ageing just recently announced 72 new aged-care nursing scholarships as part of Labor's commitment to boost the aged-care workforce. This was in addition to an investment of more than 2,800 scholarships over four years. The scholarships provide financial support for people to study nursing at university or to undertake continuing professional development. They also support people who wish to undertake nurse re-entry studies—that is particularly important. These scholarships are part of the government's efforts to address workforce pressures, with the aged-care workforce needing to almost triple in size—as my colleague pointed out—by 2050 to support our ageing population.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I am particularly supportive of the measures that will expand, support and improve access to aged-care services for people with diverse needs. I know the Greek population here has its own aged-care facility and it is particularly important that the diverse needs of Australia's population and of Canberra's population are factored into future aged-care services. My electorate is not just large but very diverse. In all areas of service provision, understanding and catering to a range of different people's needs is critical. This is something the government truly understands and is acting upon. For my electorate, this means the quality of aged-care provision will continue to improve, and Canberrans can feel confident that their loved ones will receive the best quality care possible.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The other issue raised with me is the financial cost of aged-care provision. This is a vexed issue, and I know there are different views in the sector about how to address it. In these bills we see measures that will improve the equity and the sustainability of aged-care sector financing. People entering the aged-care system need to understand exactly how much they have to pay, what they are paying for and why. The current system of government subsidies and user contributions for both residential and home care can vary. The changes we are introducing will greatly improve transparency and provide greater clarity. These reforms will result in better alignment of financial arrangements and ensure a more sustainable future for aged-care funding. Under these reforms, those who can afford to help pay for the aged care will be asked to do so while those who cannot afford to pay will still be able to access aged care.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Through these bills, the government is building a more sustainable future for aged-care funding and giving consumers real choices about how they pay for their care. For the first time, people will have real choice in how they pay for the accommodation they receive. At the same time, we are also improving the regulation of residential aged care. We are making sure there is more opportunity for care recipients and their families to purchase additional services. We are creating an aged-care system that will be simpler to navigate, will be fairer and that will create a better pathway for transition from home to residential care.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We are creating a new veterans supplement, dementia supplement and workforce supplement. We are investing millions into dementia research and help for those affected by this condition. From 1 July next year there will be just one type of approval for permanent residential care. There will also be greater continuity of services, and it will be easier under these reforms for people to move through the aged-care system.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">In broad terms, these are the major changes contained in these bills. They are measures that have undergone extensive consultation, particularly here in my electorate of Canberra. I understand that the consultation process has been welcomed and was positive, and that following the introduction of these bills there will be ongoing information sessions both here in Canberra and throughout the country.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Labor is introducing landmark legislation that will create an aged care system that will meet the demands and wishes of our ageing population. I commend the bills to the House.</span>

                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Riverina</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">13:05</span>):  I rise, following on from the member for Canberra, who spoke about the importance of seniors wanting to live with dignity in their own homes and that if that were not possible, with certainty and stability in aged care facilities such as retirement villages and nursing homes. On that point I certainly agree with her wholeheartedly, as I am sure all members in this House would.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We do have an ageing population, and that is why discussion about the Aged Care (Living Longer Living Better) Bill 2013, Australian Aged Care Quality Agency Bill 2013, Australian Aged Care Quality Agency (Transitional Provisions) Bill 2013, Aged Care (Bond Security) Amendment Bill 2013 and Aged Care (Bond Security) Levy Amendment Bill 2013 is so vitally important. Whilst I agree with the member for Canberra on some of the statements she made on the Commonwealth being able to provide for those people in their twilight years, certainly her side of politics has not helped our aged people to be able to live with the dignity that they deserve.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">During the 2010 election campaign, the Prime Minister, Julia Gillard, stated that aged care reform would be a second-term priority. In the same election campaign the Prime Minister had to deny that she had not supported big increases to the age pension because 'old people never vote for us'. Last year this Labor government, which tonight will deliver its sixth successive budget deficit, cut $1.6 billion from the aged care funding instrument, the ACFI, to fund a $1.2 billion workforce compact. The ACFI is the means by which Commonwealth subsidies are allocated to residential aged care providers. The government justified this by publicly suggesting widespread rorting was occurring amongst aged care providers, even though there has not been a single—not one!—prosecution in five years. An entire sector has been tainted—sullied—by this outrageous claim.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This government has undertaken numerous reports and reviews, including 20 reviews and three Productivity Commission reports. These reviews and reports have either been ignored continually or responded to with even more inquiries without any decisions being made to secure aged care into the future. Five years on, there is still no change on the ground—five years on.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">In 2010 the government asked the Productivity Commission to undertake an inquiry into the aged care system, and the final report, <span style="font-style:italic;">Caring for older Australians</span>, was released by the Prime Minister and the Minister for Mental Health and Ageing, Mark Butler, on 8 August 2011. Eight months later, on 20 April 2012, the Prime Minister and Minister Butler announced the government's response to the report entitled <span style="font-style:italic;">Living longer. Living better</span>.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The bills before the House today implement those parts of the package which require legislative changes, whilst implementations that required no legislative action began in April 2012. The Living Longer Living Better package of the five bills we are debating now does not resolve many outstanding viability issues for providers. These bills seek to: (1) remove the distinction between low-level and high-level residential care so there will be only one approval process for residential aged care; (2) provide a new means test, combining income and assets tests and new annual and lifetime caps on means-tested care fees; (3) allow accommodation costs to be paid for through a refundable lump sum, a rental periodic-style supplement or combination; (4) make changes to home care, including requiring a contribution for people who enter home care on or after 1 July 2014; (5) establish a new aged-care pricing commissioner; (6) extend the operation of the Accommodation Bond Guarantee Scheme to new bond arrangements reflected in the government's reforms; and, finally, establish the new Australian Aged Care Quality Agency to replace the Aged Care Standards and Accreditation Agency from 1 January next year.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">In typical Labor style, the government has cherry-picked from the Productivity Commission report, with industry sources estimating that only five to eight per cent of the recommendations have been adopted. We heard the member for Canberra just moments ago talking about how the government had consulted, how it had made wide-ranging representations to the sector. However, we all know, certainly in this House and certainly on this side of the House, just what the level of Labor consultation goes to. It is not sufficient, it is not adequate; it is never anywhere good enough. The final report received extensive industry support, with 500 submissions made to the Productivity Commission during the inquiry and an additional 500 made following the release of the draft report. Yet Labor all too often ignores the advice it has been given, as it certainly did when it decided to come out with a report following on from the Productivity Commission's, and it does not go far enough to talk to the industry sectors, whether it is agriculture, defence or, in this case, aged care.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">According to a Grant Thornton report from June 2012 following the announcement of the Living Longer Living Better package, more than $3.5 billion worth of planned aged-care development projects have been shelved. Further, an August 2012 media release from Leading Aged Care Services stated that aged-care providers face a 'black hole of more than $750 million over the next 2½ years'.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The Aged Care (Living Longer Living Better) Bill 2013 will remove the distinction between low-level and high-level residential care, so there will be only one type of approval for residential aged care. The minister has argued this will mean fewer reassessments and allow individuals requiring a permanent residential care place to access any service to meet their needs. The bill will make significant changes to the residential care subsidies and fees for recipients who enter care on or after 1 July next year. This will include a new means test combining incomes and assets tests and new annual and lifetime caps on means tested care fees. As the minister outlined in his second reading speech, the annual cap of $25,000 will be applied for means tested care fees, with a lifetime cap of $60,000. These fees are also both to be indexed.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">With regard to accommodation costs, this bill will allow fees to be paid through a refundable lump sum, a rent or periodic style supplement, or combination thereof. Aged-care providers will not be able to distinguish between care recipients based on how they will pay for their accommodation. Clause 52G-3 will provide that the minister may, by legislative instruments, determine the maximum amount of accommodation payment which an approved provider may charge a person, including the maximum daily accommodation payment amount, and a method of working out the refundable accommodation deposit.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This bill will also introduce a new form of care, home care, from 1 July 2013 which will replace community aged-care packages, extended aged care at home and extended aged care at home dementia. An income tested care fee will also be applied to home care for all except full pensioners. This fee will also be capped by year and lifetime, starting on 1 July 2014. The Aged Care Pricing Commissioner will be established under this bill to make decisions on pricing issues. The functions of the commissioner will be to approve extra service fees, to approve accommodation payments which are higher than the maximum amount of accommodation payment determined by the minister, and other functions as determined by other legislation or by the minister. Furthermore, this bill provides for an independent review to commence in 2016 and a report to the parliament by 30 June 2017.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The Aged Care (Bond Security) Amendment Bill 2013 and the Aged Care (Bond Security) Levy Amendment Bill 2013 will extend the operation of the accommodation bond guarantee scheme to new bond arrangements reflected in the government's reforms. The Australian bond guarantee scheme as prescribed in the 2006 act provides a mechanism by which the Commonwealth may repay outstanding bond balances to care recipients should a provider become insolvent or unable to refund balances. There is also the capacity for the Commonwealth to recover the costs of refunding those bonds according to the Aged Care (Bond Security) Levy Act 2006, which is amended to reflect the changes to accommodation in the Aged Care (Living Longer Living Better) Bill 2013.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The new Australian Aged Care Quality Agency, to replace the Aged Care Standards and Accreditation Agency from 1 January next year, is established under the Australian Aged Care Quality Agency Bill 2013. This new body will be the sole agency which providers of aged care will deal with in relation to quality assurance of aged-care services providers, whether in the home or in a residential facility. The functions of the new agency will be to accredit residential care facilities; conduct quality reviews of home care services; promote high-quality care innovation in quality management and continuous improvement amongst approved providers of aged care; and provide information, education and training to approved providers of aged care. The Australian Aged Care Quality Agency (Transitional Provisions) Bill 2013 will enable the transfer of assets and liabilities from the Aged Care Standards and Accreditation Agency Ltd to the Commonwealth to facilitate the establishment of the new Australian Aged Care Quality Agency from New Year's Day 2014.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">On 7 November last year I hosted the shadow minister for ageing and mental health, Senator Concetta Fierravanti-Wells, in my electorate of Riverina. We held a forum attended by a large number of aged-care providers and interested people at Griffith to discuss their thoughts and concerns about the Living Longer Living Better proposals specifically and aged-care services more broadly. We also visited Scalabrini Village, Griffith, where Lauren Kingsbury showed us through before we visited the Griffith Neighbourhood House to discuss with Monica Beckman the facility and the funding needs it has to continue to provide much-needed services to the community—a community, I might add, which has been hard-hit in recent times by poor water policy from this government, and a community which has an ageing population. Many of those people came to this country to start a new life after the ravages of World War II. They did everything this government required of them in building a wonderful city and a wonderful community, and they now deserve the very best treatment in aged-care services that this country and this government can provide, because they have done their bit to help this nation—certainly to grow food to help feed this nation and others—and now we owe it to them to repay that faith that they showed in this country. Many of them, of course, are Australian born, and they too have done their bit—more than their bit, I might add—to help this country and to make it the great food provider that it is. It behoves us to make sure that we look after those people in their twilight years.</span>

                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">One of the major failings of this package is the opportunity the government has missed to reduce the administrative burden—and haven't we heard that on so many levels, in so many speeches that I and many of my colleagues have given—and the red tape and, in too many cases, the green tape. In a sector already swaddled in red tape, this package will deliver even more regulation. The point is repeatedly made—and indeed, was made at the aged-care forum in Griffith that I hosted—that aged-care nurses spend a significant amount of time on unnecessary paperwork. This package is only going to make the piles of paperwork grow and grow and, unfortunately, grow.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The coalition wants reform in partnership with the aged-care sector, and we will provide that. Hopefully, we will be able to do that after 14 September. We do not believe fundamental reform should be imposed from above. Should we be elected to government, we will deliver the first ever aged-care providers' agreement framework, which will be the cornerstone of all of our policy. We want this agreement in place within a year of our taking office in order to begin the real reform that this sector so desperately needs and that Labor has continually failed to deliver.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">In my time available, I will also mention the Haven's recent $7.8 million upgrade, which was completed and opened on 27 March. I was fortunate enough to be at that opening with the general manager of that fine organisation, Shane McMullen. Interestingly, the renovation and enlargement of 36 single rooms within the Nan Roberts Community, the construction of two more rooms, improvements to staff facilities and all of the rest were done without government grants. Recurrent funding was used to complete the upgrade, and the South Wagga Lions Club, a wonderful community organisation, did so much work and so much fundraising to make that a reality. All too sadly, in regional areas communities are left to fund their own projects. I could mention the radiotherapy centre at Wagga Wagga, where the community pitched in when there was no—or very little—government help forthcoming to make sure that they got their own facility, which is now the pride of southern New South Wales as far as those facilities are concerned. It is used all too frequently, I might add, because of the number of cancer sufferers and patients in southern New South Wales. But it is still a marvellous and necessary facility. At the moment, there is a very dedicated group of people working to provide palliative care services in Wagga Wagga. Hopefully, this government or a future government will be able to provide much-needed funding for that particular issue and that particular cause, which is so very vital in Wagga Wagga and, indeed, the Riverina electorate I represent.</span>

                      <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Mrs MARKUS</span>
                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Macquarie</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">13:20</span>):  I rise to speak on the Aged Care (Living Longer Living Better) Bill 2013 and cognate bills. I believe that one of the ways we as a society are judged is the way in which we look after and care for our elderly. Those in aged-care facilities are at a very vulnerable and sometimes difficult stage in life. We have all been in a position where a grandmother, grandfather or parent has had to go into aged care, and as fellow human beings we know that our elderly deserve not only dignity but also respect at this stage of their lives. We have a responsibility to the aged—to our seniors—to provide them with the best services and care available and to support the service providers who engage and respond to their needs.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">During the 2010 election campaign the Prime Minister said, 'If re-elected, further aged-care reform will be a second-term priority for my government.' Australians can add that statement to the list of broken promises by this Prime Minister. We have seen a government undertake a litany of reports and reviews, including 20 reviews and three Productivity Commission reports, which are continually ignored or responded to with more inquiries without making any decisions to secure aged care into the future.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Despite promises of reform, five years on there is very little evidence of real change on the ground, where it counts the most. After five years of Labor's neglect our aged-care system needs urgent change to provide viable and effective aged-care services for older Australians. Labor has failed to undertake proper and sustainable reform and to make the hard decisions to give effect to it. It is clear that the Living Longer Living Better package of five bills does not resolve many outstanding viability issues for providers. Under these reforms there have been cuts from the Aged Care Funding Instrument—ACFI—that have placed substantially more pressure on the sector. The bills only cherry pick a few recommendations of the Productivity Commission report <span style="font-style:italic;">Caring for older Australians</span> from August 2011. They add to regulation in what is already a highly regulated sector. The bills establish the framework for the workforce compact, which has created uncertainty, potentially will be costly for providers, relies on cuts to ACFI and appears to be a political mechanism to unionise the sector.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Only the coalition has a clear plan for the future of aged care in this nation. We understand that it is only by working closely with the sector and consulting those who are on the front line that real reform can be achieved. We want to work in partnership with the ageing and aged-care sector to achieve sustainable reform through our first-ever four-year aged-care provider agreement. Older Australians in the sector are no closer to knowing how structural reform would be introduced and how it would affect the care they receive and where they receive it.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The ageing of our population is one of the biggest social issues facing Australians and is an issue that needs to be addressed now, not somewhere down the track or into the future. Australians are living longer, but we have a rapidly ageing population. In its <span style="font-style:italic;">Global ageing 2010: an irreversible</span><span style="font-style:italic;"> truth</span>, Standard &amp; Poor's rating service said that age related spending on health, pensions and aged care in Australia is estimated to rise to 14.4 per cent of gross domestic product in 2050. It is currently 9.6 per cent. Around nine per cent of our population is aged 70 years or older, and this is expected to rise to 13 per cent by 2021 and to 20 per cent—around 5.7 million people—in 2051. As we are ageing we are acquiring more complex health conditions and changing disease patterns, resulting in increasing and changing aged-care needs. With fewer people generating taxation revenue, care options for concessional and assisted aged-care residents—those with the least resources—will be jeopardised.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">There is growing and alarming evidence that the aged-care sector cannot provide the care that Australians expect. There are real economic implications for our nation because of our ageing population, and these implications have not been taken seriously by this government. Until there is a proper structural reform of the sector, the care and wellbeing of senior Australians is in jeopardy. Australia has one of the most advanced aged-care systems in the world. However, it can be complex and difficult to navigate. Currently over one million older Australians are receiving aged-care services subsidised by the Australian government. It is expected that by 2050 over 3.5 million Australians will be using aged care each year. Formal aged-care services are delivered through around 8,000 outlets across Australia, including about 3,660 agencies registered as delivering services funded through the HACC program, 2,095 operational community care services delivering community packages, and more than 2,700 operational residential aged-care facilities. The number of over-85-year-olds, which are the main users of aged-care services, will increase from around 400,000, or 1.7 per cent of the total population, in 2007 to 1.6 million by 2047—about 5.6 per cent for the population. The Department of Health and Ageing estimates that by 2050 aged-care expenditure will account for three per cent of GDP and a bit more than 827,000, or five per cent, of the Australian workforce may be engaged in the provision of aged care.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">If there was ever a call to action for reform of aged care, this is it. These statistics are alarming and call for careful planning and action. However, at a time when there is increasing demand for services, providers are walking away from the sector because of the lack of viability of providing high-care beds and the increase in compliance demands of the government. It has been reported that up to 60 per cent of aged-care facilities are operating in the red. That is a staggering amount and reflects the economic situation that many providers find themselves in. Providers are handing back licences, and senior Australians are having to wait longer or travel further to find a bed, thereby placing extra pressure on the public hospital system and, most importantly and unfortunately, on their families. This is in contrast with the situation that we would hope to achieve under the coalition. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The Productivity Commission's final report, <span style="font-style:italic;">Caring for older Australians</span>, was publicly released by the Prime Minister and minister on 8 August 2011. This report focuses on a shift from the current ration system based on licences and packages to an entitlement based system whereby aged care would become part of the health system. Other key features of the report include the creation of a single Australian seniors gateway agency and the recommendation that funding be replaced by a single national care co-contribution regime, which would apply across the aged-care system, whether services are delivered in the community or in a residential aged-care facility. It took the Australian government over 250 days to respond to 58 recommendations within the Productivity Commission's report. When that response finally came it was announced with great fanfare as supposedly extensive reform of the aged-care system. Whilst the headline figure of $3.7 billion over five years sounded impressive, the actual amount of new money to be spent was $577 million. Furthermore, many of the changes will not start until 1 July 2014, so the effect will not be felt until well after the next federal election. The coalition and I acknowledge that one of the failures in the aged-care reform package is the missed opportunity to reduce red tape. This is something that the sector has been urgently demanding. In a sector already wallowing in red tape, this package will heap on them more red tape and more bureaucracies to deal with. The coalition has been advised that aged-care nurses spend on average a third of their time on paperwork. Under this package, things are only going to get worse.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This is not real reform; this is another case of Labor talking but not doing anything. Some key issues have caused major concern to stakeholders: the decision to rip $1.6 billion out of the ACFI, the $1.2 billion workforce compact, and the establishment of the Aged Care Financing Authority. One critical need to be addressed is the almost 321,600 Australians living with dementia. When in government, the coalition committed $320 million in the 2005 budget to help fund the Dementia Initiative, making dementia a national health priority. Despite this initiative proving invaluable to help dementia sufferers, and a government evaluation of October 2009 finding the initiative successful, Labor deliberately dropped funding for this program. It was pleasing to see that at a subsequent meeting of health ministers dementia has now been made a national health priority. The coalition is committed to delivering a high quality, affordable and accessible aged-care scheme that meets the needs and preferences of older Australians.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">At the last federal election, the coalition outlined its plan for the first ever four-year agreement and we set out some areas which we believe ought to be included in any agreement. We undertook to provide certainty of care through the first ever four-year aged-care provider agreement with the aged-care sector, and as part of that process we outlined various areas for inclusion in such an agreement. There was a very positive response. Since the last federal election, the coalition has continued to listen to the aged-care sector. We will be revising our policy before the next federal election. The fundamental framework—the first ever aged-care provider agreement framework—will be retained. It is important to stress that this is the first ever aged-care provider agreement. It would ensure certainty and engagement for the aged-care sector. In much the same way as the pharmacy agreement shapes that sector, this agreement would set the framework for aged care in Australia for the next four years.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The coalition plan to reduce red tape as an important component of our four-year agreement. Providing flexibility and certainty, we want to work with the sector to cut red tape in ways which will provide efficiencies without compromising the quality of care. The agreement will deliver better and more affordable aged care by: reducing red tape and enabling nurses to get back to nursing residents; providing certainty for aged care for older Australians, underpinned by a high quality framework; delivering value for money through revised subsidy arrangements; ensuring certainty for the aged-care workforce; establishing a more flexible and viable aged-care provider network to meet care needs now and in the future; and ensuring that the comfort and safety of older Australians is maximised.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The coalition want reform in partnership with the aged-care sector. We do not believe that fundamental reform should be imposed from above. Given the opportunity to govern following the next federal election, we will immediately commence consultation with stakeholders in the ageing and aged-care sector on the framework for the aged-care provider agreement, including consideration of the recommendations of the Productivity Commission. The coalition want an agreement in place within a year of taking office.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The coalition does not want to pre-empt the contents of any negotiated agreement. The agreement framework establishes a formal pathway for future dialogue between the minister, the government and stakeholders to more effectively consider ongoing issues regarding timely and appropriate access to aged care. It will guarantee flexibility and much needed certainty in the sector. Principal Endeavour aged-care facility, in the electorate of Macquarie, have the following statement in their mission statement:</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">Our aim is not just to provide a home, but to provide a lifestyle surrounded by a caring, active, wholesome community.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I too believe that this should be the aim of every aged-care facility, but this can only happen by real change and reform and through the government partnering with the sector to allow them to do what they do best. I support the amendment moved by the shadow minister today and commend it to the House.</span>

                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Lyne</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">13:33</span>):  I strongly support these bills finally passing into the House. It has been disappointing that it has taken so long for them to finally make it to the chamber, but I hope that they do pass this House and the other place relatively quickly, because I know there are many, both in the workforce and as aged-care providers, in the sector who are very keen to see this legislation pass.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">In my electorate on the mid-North Coast of New South Wales and, indeed, on the east coast, aged care is the boom industry of the moment. Quite often, it is not seen as an economic driver and an economic sector, but for my region and, indeed, for the east coast, we are seeing more growth in aged care than in industries such as mining and more jobs in health and community services than in the mining sector. It does fly under the radar, but this is an incredibly important economic driver for the east coast and for regions like the mid-North Coast of New South Wales as service provision for our ageing demographic becomes more and more important in Australia over the coming years. I am certainly a strong advocate of getting the aged-care sector right and making sure that we provide the best quality of care possible for the many residents in our area who, in a number of different ways, require services. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">By way of a stocktake, in the Lyne electorate on the mid-North Coast of New South Wales, we currently have 409 community aged-care packages; 40 Extended Aged Care at Home packages, known as EACH packages; and 24 Extended Aged Care at Home Dementia packages. All of those touch only the surface of what is really required. I think that is a mood shared by all members in this chamber. Whilst each of these packages is certainly welcome, the need far outweighs what is being provided to date by all levels of government and by both sides of parliament. Ensuring that a quality level of service is provided in what is a growing market in communities such as those on the mid-North Coast is an enormous challenge. In 2012-13, 144 home care package places were also advertised in the mid-North Coast aged-care planning region. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I am not one to criticise the aged-care sector at all. At times, various stories emerge in this parliament or in various communities that shock you, but they are rare. I believe that the quality of care in Australia today is at a level of excellence that we as a country should actually be very proud of. Both our monitoring and reporting standards are some of the best in the world and, again, I do not think we sing the praises enough of our culture of care for the various stages through the ageing process.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Every day on the mid-North Coast I see quality providers, a quality workforce and families of carers who really do rally around their family members, who work their way through the spectrum of care and who really want to see the best outcome possible for them. We as Australians should enhance that culture and, hopefully, this range of bills today will be another step along that journey.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I have tracked these bills pretty closely with the support of some local aged-care providers, whom I would like to mention: Dennis Marks, the CEO of Bundaleer Care Services; John Butler, the CEO of Nambucca Valley Care Ltd; Errol Curran, the Director of Residential Aged Care Services and the Chief Financial Officer of the Bushland Health Group; and Steven Quirk, Chief Executive Officer of St Agnes' Parish, Catholic Care of the Aged, in Port Macquarie. Others have been involved at various times in our roundtable meetings that we have been holding. The group wanted to take up with the government a range of detailed issues that have emerged, in particular with Minister Butler, to the point where, three or four months ago, I brought them down to Canberra and the minister kindly met them. It looks as though, as a consequence of some of those meetings, there have been some changes to the final bills. That has been a worthwhile process. The feedback from the group at this stage is that this package of bills is not going to cure all ills. It is not going to get the workforce pay to the level it should be, to be competitive to attract the absolute best staff possible, but it is a step forward.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Likewise, there are some issues for mid-tier residential providers in lower socioeconomic communities. There are still some question marks about this aged care reform package continuing to allow those very noble and important providers to stay viable. But I am fully aware that the government is watching and tracking that and, if there are issues that emerge, hopefully all governments will be very quick in responding to that. As one part of a suite of measures, this package of reforms I think is one to support, and hopefully the House supports it relatively swiftly.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This fits in well with some local work that we have been doing. The mid-North Coast is one of the first regions in Australia to develop a dementia care plan. We do have an epidemic in Australia coming, if not arrived, in the area of dementia. Rather than just wallow in the concerns of the epidemic hitting us, I am really pleased that our community has come together and put a bit of a strategy together that will align well with these aged care reforms. And I would encourage government to have a look at the work we have done and to provide what resources are possible to allow our region to maximise the work we have been doing locally in trying to deal with the very high number of dementia patients now, and with the significant growth expected in the near term. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The other point I did want to make is on the jobs plan we put together locally. As I said before, the health and community service area is our boom industry of the moment on the mid-North Coast, and so aged care workforce needs are really important to us. I wanted to take this chance to thank the many people who have been involved in the many meetings in making sure our workforce needs meet the demands. They include the local employment coordinator, Renee Hawkins, the aged care workforce coordinator, Jan Johnson, and the new group that has come into town, the Aged Care Workforce Innovation Network. This group is now funded by the Australian government and led by the aged care peak bodies in partnership with the Community Services and Health Industry Skills Council and is now starting to pull together some really good work in our region to address a lot of these workforce needs today and into the future.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I am pleased that, because our region has been working so hard with so little and had to collaborate a lot, we have now become one of the regions to lead in this workforce innovation network. Collaboration is one of the keys that allows that industry development work to take shape. Very quickly, of the 10 regions funded, the mid-North Coast is looking like one of the standouts because we have been collaborating on the smell of an oily rag for a long time, and had to do that to basically survive as a region. I thank everyone involved in that process, both within and around government but also more importantly at a committee level, for really investing time and energy into the many meetings—everyone hates meetings, but they have made a difference and they certainly are setting us up as a region where our aged care workforce will be viable and strong, our providers will be viable and strong and our quality of care, therefore, will be viable and strong. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I think the mid-North Coast is one of the best places in Australia for anyone to hit retirement age. That is not only for the healthy living issues and all of our wonderful beaches and rivers, but also for that spectrum of care around aged care, when and if required. I hope these bills go through, I hope they go through with bipartisan support and I hope they make a big difference in once again taking a step forward in the quality of care for the aged care sector in Australia today.</span>

                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">
                    <a href="00AN0" type="MemberSpeech">
                      <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Mr CIOBO</span>
                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Moncrieff</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">13:46</span>):  I am pleased to rise to speak in the debate on the Aged Care (Living Longer Living Better) Bill 2013 and cognate bills and to follow those speakers who have been speaking before me. I think it is important in the context of a debate about aged care to get an appreciation of what is happening to the demographics of Australian society. We know and we hear frequently that Australia is an ageing nation, like many other Western democracies. We have seen our birth rate decline, so much so that in fact we are now below replacement level with respect to our population. The reason that Australia continues to see an overall net increase in population is migration.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The fundamental point that we have with respect to this cognate debate is what is taking place across Australian society. We know that our population is ageing. The ageing of our population is in every respect the biggest social issue that faces Australia. Australians are generally living longer and as a consequence we have a rapidly ageing population. To put some context around it, about nine per cent of our population is aged 70 years or older. That is anticipated to rise to 13 per cent by 2021 and to reach 20 per cent by 2051. That will be just shy of six million Australians aged 70 and over.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The consequences of the proportion those aged 70 and over increasing from nine per cent of our population to 20 per cent are profound. It is appropriate that today of all days—budget day—we consider what the ramifications of an ageing population actually are. The ramifications are significant and varied. In many respects it was the recognition of the ageing of Australia's population that gave rise to an important major public policy change to take place: the introduction of the GST. That reform was a coalition reform that we undertook because we knew it to be in Australia's long-term interest. It was opposed by the Labor Party, despite the fact that only years earlier the Labor Party had championed the cause for a broad based consumption tax, on the basis of political opportunism while the coalition took the hard decision to introduce a new tax. It was a tax that we knew would not be popular. It was a reform that we undertook not because we knew it was going to win us votes on the street but because we knew it to be necessary for Australia's long-term interest. It stands in remarkable contrast, frankly, to the way that Labor has gone about introducing the carbon tax. Unlike the coalition, who said, 'We will introduce a GST if you elect us,' the Labor Party said, 'We will not introduce a carbon tax', and they did the exact opposite. In fact, who can forget the Prime Minister saying, only six days out from the last election, 'There will be no carbon tax under a government I lead'? Lo and behold, we discovered only weeks later that, in fact, she was going to impose not only a carbon tax but the biggest carbon tax in the world. That is the difference between the approach of the coalition historically and the approach of the government.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">With an ageing population the question is: how do we from a public policy perspective deal with the challenges we will face? For example, one of the consequences of an ageing population is that there will be an increasing dependency ratio. Whereas in 2007 approximately six people of working age for every person aged over 67 was the dependency ratio, by 2047 that ratio will be down to 3.2 people of working age for every person aged 67 and over. What does that mean? What does a decrease from six people for every person aged over 67 to 3.2 people for every person aged over 67 mean in terms of the fiscal consequences for all Australians? The fundamental inescapable truth is that it is basically bad news. It is good that Australians are living longer; it is good that Australians are ageing, but the fiscal challenges it presents are profound. Whereas the Australian government can now rely on approximately six working Australians for every one person aged 67 or over, by the late 2040s there will only be three working Australians for every person aged over 67.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The reason that it is a significant problem from a fiscal perspective is that those aged 67 and older, not always but generally, have a heavier reliance on the public purse. Whether it be in healthcare costs, in the pension or in other forms of support and concessions they would like to have available to them, the fact is that Australians that live beyond the age of 67 typically take the view—and in many respects they are entitled to take this view—that: 'I've worked my entire life, I've paid my taxes, I've made my contribution to Australian society, and I expect henceforth to reap some of the dividends of a lifetime of earning income.' The fiscal problem with someone aged over 67 is that with a greater reliance on the public purse comes an increased need for it to be funded. As the proportion of people aged 67 and over goes from nine per cent of the population to 20 per cent of the population—more and more people being a bigger drain on the public purse with fewer and fewer people to pay for it—it represents a challenge that somehow must be funded.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Those that are not particularly charitable might take the view that it is a problem that only this side of the House concerns itself with. Those less charitable might say that only the coalition is genuinely concerned about how we fund future challenges. We know, based on the form of this government, that the Labor Party do not particularly care about how we fund future challenges. That is the reason why the Labor Party will stand up and make announcements such as during this Living Longer Living Better cognate debate and package of bills. That is why they will put forward reforms such as Gonski or the NDIS without the appropriate safeguards to make sure there is funding in place to provide the necessary future funding required to meet those liabilities. That is important because any government that signs up the Australian population to future liabilities—be it Gonski, be it NDIS, be it aged-care reform—needs to make sure it is not putting on future generations of Australians a tax burden so significant that they are no longer able or willing to fund it.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">In the debate around aged care, this is the consequence. When you shift from six taxpayers funding every person aged 67 and over down to just over three taxpayers funding every person aged 67 and over, it means that the tax burden on those people is significant. When you view that in the context of the current debate that will be taking place in this chamber tonight, we know that there are some serious challenges ahead. That is part of the reason why the coalition introduced the GST, but more importantly it is the reason the coalition was so committed to paying down debt. It is the recognition of the fact that Australia's population is ageing that drove the coalition to pay off the $96 billion of debt the Labor left when they were last in office. It was at the core of the coalition's economic approach: to pay down debt and to put our economy and our country on a strong, stable footing, knowing full well that in future decades there will be very significant drawdowns on the public purse. Those drawdowns must be met by taxation across the population. That is why we paid down debt.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The problem that we have now is that as we shift over the coming decades to having only three people paying all the liabilities expected by a person aged 67 and over—with only three people shouldering the tax burden to support the generous pensions and generous healthcare entitlements and concessions that that person is expecting—it makes it very expensive. And not only will meeting the recurrent liabilities that exist be expensive; this government has racked up $172 billion worth of deficits in the last five years. Australia's net debt currently sits at around $140 billion. We know that it is going to get a hell of a lot worse tonight.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We saw two weeks ago Labor saying—despite on over 400 occasions promising that this year's budget would be in surplus—that this year's budget will in fact be yet another deficit. On 400 occasions, Labor said, 'We will deliver a budget surplus.' The member for Oxley, who is at the table, circulated a newsletter to his electorate that said, 'We delivered a budget surplus.' But what do we actually know? Two weeks ago they said, 'No, cancel that. There's not going to be a budget surplus. It was going to be $1 billion of surplus but now it is going to be a $7.5 billion deficit.' That was two weeks ago. One week ago, they changed it. They said: 'Scratch that. It's not going to be a $7 billion deficit; it's actually going to be a $12 billion deficit.' That was one week ago. Then a matter of about 72 hours ago—</span>

                      <span class="HPS-MemberContinuation">Mr CIOBO:</span>
                    </a>  We know that 72 hours ago it shifted from a $12 billion deficit to a $17 billion deficit. If we are going to be serious and look older Australians in the eye and say, 'We can afford to pay for aged care,' and if the government wants to be serious about saying that they can meet the challenges of an ageing population when we shift from nine per cent of the population being over 65 to 20 per cent of the population being over 65, then I say that it is crucial that this government tells us how much debt and deficit they have racked up over the past five years. The reckless spending by the Labor Party must stop. For as long as Labor keeps spending and borrowing and spending and borrowing, the simple reality is that the Australian population in decades to come will have to shoulder the burden. And it is unfair not only for older Australians but for new Australians. The consequences of Labor's policies affect both ends of the spectrum. It is young Australians who will have to shoulder this debt and deficit burden for decades to come. It is young Australians who are in schools today who will have to carry the heavy tax burden as a consequence of Labor's reckless spending over the past five years. Older Australians will also pay the price.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">While the Labor Party can have packages of bills entitled 'Living Longer Living Better', while they can claim to be introducing $500 million of new spending, the simple reality is that this is not new money that has come from fiscal prudence; it is money that is being borrowed from abroad. That is entirely consistent with an approach that the Labor Party has had over the last five years that has seen them borrow money from aboard to spend locally on all sorts of projects that they deem to be warranted. Unlike for much of the spending, there is some support for the Living Longer Living Better package and the need to make sure that older Australians are well cared for. But there has been so much waste from the Labor Party. Who can forget pink batts? Who could forget the blow-outs on border protection? We have seen so many blow-outs under this Labor government—</span>

Aged Australians know that they have worked hard and for decades they have paid their taxes, and they expect the government to look after them. But now when the real pressure is on, the Labor Party has abandoned older Australians just as it has abandoned young Australians who will have to carry the burden and pay the taxes. That is the reason the coalition has a problem with these bills.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">A man named Ian Bonython Cameron Wilson could only come from one Australian state. For almost a quarter of a century Ian Wilson served South Australia, Adelaide, and the people of Sturt in this House. His father, Keith Wilson, had held the seat of Sturt before him almost continuously from 1949 until 1966. His mother, Lady Betty Wilson, was the granddaughter of Sir John Bonython, a member of the very first House of Representatives after Federation, not to mention the owner of the <span style="font-style:italic;">Advertiser</span>. Betty was also the great granddaughter of Sir John Bray, the first Premier of South Australia to be born in that state. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The choice of profession for the young Ian must have seemed ordained. Ian Wilson was born in 1932. He was educated at St Peter's College and graduated in law from the University of Adelaide. After graduating, he studied at Oxford as a 1955 Rhodes scholar, two years after Bob Hawke and a year before Neal Blewett. Returning to Australia, Ian practised as a barrister and solicitor before entering federal parliament in 1966 as the member for Sturt in his father's footsteps in his father's old electorate. Ian went on to hold that seat, except for a single term between 1969 and 1972, from the mid-1960s until 1993.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Ian was a man of moderate views, of conviction and compassion. He was active in many charitable causes and involved in a number of social welfare groups, including the Good Neighbour Council of South Australia and St Matthew's homes for the aged. This flavoured his work as a minister in the Fraser government. After briefly serving as Parliamentary Secretary to the Prime Minister, Ian went on to serve as Minister for Home Affairs and Environment from 1981 to 1982. He was then Minister for Aboriginal Affairs as well as the Minister Assisting the Minister for Social Security from 1982 to 1983.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">In addition to his ministerial service, Ian Wilson had a long and distinguished career of service to the parliament. He served on and contributed his wisdom to many committees and represented the parliament overseas on a number of occasions. Ian Wilson retired at the 1993 federal election. After his death last month at the age of 80 there were many tributes for a man known for his integrity and honesty. One word re-occurred in many of these testimonials—'gentleman'. On behalf of the government, I offer condolences to Ian's wife of 52 years, Mary, his sons, Keith, Richard, James and Nigel, and their families.</span>

As the Prime Minister has already indicated, Ian Wilson came from a long line of distinguished servants of our country and our community. His great-grandfather was Sir John Bray, the Premier of South Australia in the 1880s. His great-great-grandfather was the newspaper proprietor and philanthropist, Sir Langdon Bonython, and his father, Sir Keith, was in fact the first member for Sturt.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Ian Wilson was a member of this parliament in two stints for 24 years. He was a Rhodes scholar. He was a minister for the last two years of the Fraser government, including a stint as Minister for Aboriginal Affairs. He was very well liked in his electorate and, in fact, when he came into the parliament in 1972, he was one of the very few coalition members of parliament who won against the trend in that particular year. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">His life was the very epitome of public service. Once there were many like Ian Wilson, who regarded themselves as having a vocation to public service. Sadly, there is less of that today. Nevertheless, we honour his spirit and perhaps we encourage others to emulate it by remembering him in this parliament. On behalf of the coalition, we pass our condolences to his widow, Mary, and his sons.</span>

With the passing of Margaret Thatcher, the world has lost one of the towering giants of modern history. She gave Britain a future as well as a past. As the current British Prime Minister, David Cameron, said, 'She did not just lead her country, she saved it'.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">If I may, Madam Speaker, I wish to read onto the parliamentary record a tribute to Margaret Thatcher from Brian Griffiths, now with Goldman Sachs, who worked with her at No. 10 Downing Street. Brian Griffiths writes:</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Small">She was wonderful to work for, even though she was demanding. If you put a policy proposal to her she would raise dozens of questions which probed every detail of it. She was hugely enthusiastic and for a politician remarkably intellectually curious. She loved exploring ideas, Hayek, Freedman, the Bible, socialism, but managed at the same time to be intensely practical. She loved an argument; hated 'yes' men; expected her colleagues to work as hard as her; she read everything we sent her from the policy unit; she had a limited sense of humour, except when there was no one else around; had great respect for the ability of the average person to manage their own affairs; and also had a real Christian faith which ultimately was the basis of her public policies. She was also exceptionally kind to all who worked for her.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">She may not have had a great sense of humour but she certainly had a dry wit, as John Howard reminded us early on in her term. She declared to a Conservative Party conference her absolute pride that she was the first, the very first, British Prime Minister to be—there was a pause—'a research scientist', she said.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">She was one of those people who demonstrated that the individual can make a difference. In her case, not only did she change lives but also she changed a country and contributed to changing the world for the better.</span>

I trust there will be cooperation from members and their guests in the galleries, and that the budget night and the budget night reply will proceed smoothly for the benefit of the House and for those watching and indeed for our nation so that we can ensure everyone who is listening hears the budget and the budget in reply. </span>

As I understand the Leader of the Opposition's statements in recent days on DisabilityCare and on a another major item of reform in nation, our school improvement plan and school funding plan, he has been advocating that the government show over the long term how these major new programs for our nation's future, these smart investments, should be funded.

The government has been working hard to make sure that in our country no-one is left behind. That is why we are committed to making smart investments for our nation's future. We have been working to sign up every state and territory to start DisabilityCare in Australia, the National Disability Insurance Scheme. I can report to the parliament that we are now in a position to say such agreements have been struck to cover 90 per cent of the Australian population, and we will be working to get an agreement with the Premier of Western Australia.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">We are absolutely committed to DisabilityCare because for far too long people with disabilities in our nation and their families and carers have been subjected to a cruel lottery. The amount of assistance you got depended on where you live, the circumstances in which you got your disability and whether or not you got in before the services available had run out because they were capped and they were queued. This is a campaign for reform that has been advocated by disability groups, the disability sector, people with disabilities and their carers and families for decades. I am very proud that this government listened to the disability sector and we are now delivering DisabilityCare. </span>

I am pleased that we were able to strike an agreement with New South Wales which will see an extra $5 billion in extra funding go into the classrooms of New South Wales. We will pursue getting agreements with other states because this is right for our children and our nation's future.</span>

All of these things are about ensuring that our economy is stronger, that our nation is smarter, that we are a fairer society. That is what guides this government. It is what will guide the budget delivered by the Treasurer tonight—stronger for the future, smarter for our children's education and fairer with DisabilityCare extended right around the country. It is plan for our nation's future, a plan we are very proud of.</span>

Let us be absolutely clear: this is a government which has engaged in an historic increase in the pension because we wanted older Australians to be treated with dignity and with respect to get a basic level of fairness in our society, something denied to them for far too long by those opposite when they were in power. </span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">Come the next election, the choice for Australia's pensioners will be us continuing to invest in the aged-care pension versus the Leader of the Opposition's plan to cut back Australian pensions. The Leader of the Opposition stands for that plan just like he stands for the end of the schoolkids bonus to make families with children worse off; just like he stands for getting Australians to pay more tax by changing the tax-free threshold, putting it down, making sure Australians pay more tax; just like he stands for the eradication of the low-income superannuation contribution so more than three million low-income Australians—predominantly women—miss out. That is not the government's way. </span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">The government's way, as will be shown in this budget, is to ensure that we protect jobs and growth, that we chart a path to surplus, that we make the smart investments for the future and that we continue to work with Australians to support them with the services they need. The debate in Australian politics today is between that plan and that vision of the future and the Leader of the Opposition's plan to cut to the bone—to cut the services that Australians need, to put our economy into a standstill as a result of that reckless austerity and those cuts. The Leader of the Opposition will have an opportunity on Thursday night to outline the details of his plans to cut Australian services to the bone, to rip away from Australians the supports that they need. </span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">For the government's budget tonight, what you will see is a government focussed on jobs and growth, proud that we have created around 950,000 jobs since we came to office, proud that we have worked for decency for working conditions in those jobs, proud that we have increased pensions, proud that we have worked with Australian families through things like the schoolkids bonus and increasing the tax-free threshold so that they have more supports than they used to under the former government. There is a choice, there is a contrast here. It is a very clear one and I hope the Leader of the Opposition details his on Thursday night.</span>

Isn't the Leader of the Opposition embarrassed to be so pathetic on budget day that he has nothing new to say about jobs, the economy, smart investments for the future or treating Australians fairly? This is a man who is simply not up to it, and that question shows it very, very clearly.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Kingsford Smith</span>—<span class="HPS-MinisterialTitles">Minister for School Education, Early Childhood and Youth</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">14:24</span>):  I want to thank the member for Banks for that question because we think that investing in education is the most important investment that a nation can make. We know that education is the great enabler. For young Australians to live a successful and happy life the quality of their education will count. For us to have young Australians who are well educated and get high-paid, high-skilled jobs in the future will contribute to our national prosperity over time. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Education has been front and centre of this government's agenda and remains there. Look at what we have done already. For the first time we have a national curriculum. For the first time there will be over one million students sitting NAPLAN today, national testing in literacy and numeracy. We have the MySchool website and have improved facilities in every school in the country, especially focusing effort on the things that we know count in the school and in the classroom. That is about teacher quality and making sure our kids are learning to read and do their maths well at an early age. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">But we know there is more to do. The Gonski panel, who looked at school funding, provided us with a set of recommendations that said that we need to fund schools on a basis that is fair and on a basis that is effective. We have accepted the thrust of those recommendations and we have a National Plan for School Improvement, with the goal to have Australia in the top five education nations in the world by 2025. We are backing that plan with effectively a '$2 from the Commonwealth and $1 from the state' investment that would see some $14.5 billion in additional funding exercised and spent over time to make sure that every student, no matter where they live and no matter how much money their parents earn, is getting the education that they need.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I am asked about how the National Plan for School Improvement has been received. The fact is it has been received very positively. I can hardly find a person in the country who thinks and cares about education who has not been positive about this reform—teachers, parents and the business community. New South Wales, as the Prime Minister has said, have agreed in the interests of their students that the National Plan for School Improvement is something that they want to be a part of. In fact, the New South Wales Premier said:</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Small">… it provides additional resources, fairer distribution, to deliver higher standards and better outcomes …</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I do not agree with everything that Premier O'Farrell says or does, but on this count I think he got it right. The only negative voices we have heard are from the Leader of the Opposition and the shadow minister. The Leader of the Opposition thinks that increasing investment to public education is an injustice. They will not support this national plan for the nation's future.</span>

I know how important it is to him as a local member that the schools in his electorate are well supported. Let me apprise those listening what this government has done on education. Let us look at the existing level of investment in the member's electorate—107 new projects at 43 schools under the Building the Education Revolution program; building and upgrading 22 classrooms, seven libraries, 18 multipurpose halls and a language centre; and computers in schools that benefit from the national partnerships. The point about the National Plan for School Improvement for electorates like those of the member for Banks—and every Labor member knows it and every member opposite ought to know it—is that additional investment into schools in this country will make a difference to the education of the kids in those schools. We are investing in great teachers, focusing on school improvement, giving more power to local principals and giving the resources to do the things that count.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">I spoke in my first answer in the House about how important it is that young Australians get on a sound footing in literacy and numeracy at an early age. That might mean, for example, a literacy coach in one of the member for Banks's schools. In fact, I visited I think the Narwee Public School with the member earlier on and I could see what a difference these investments are making and will continue to make under the National Plan for School Improvement. <span style="font-style:italic;">(Time expired)</span></span>

The question goes to matters that will be the subject of the budget this evening. Of course, I make the point that this is a government that regularly engages in consultation with all relevant stakeholders. It might come as a surprise to some on the other side, but that is a very reasonable way to engage in a systematic process of policy review.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The question goes very directly to the question of profit-shifting activities. This has been an area that I have spoken about at length. The government has absolutely no time for multinational enterprises that are engaged in profit-shifting activity—and, indeed, this is a debate that has been occurring not just in this country but all around the world.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I do make the point that, when it comes to cracking down on loopholes and protecting the corporate tax base, this government has taken some very, very strenuous measures in order to protect the revenue base. In doing so, I make the point that we have put in place measures, or brought measures into the parliament, that have sought to protect the revenue to the tune of $11 billion.</span>

                  </a>  Thank you very much, Speaker. I can understand the concern. I am simply pointing out that each of those measures that have protected $11 billion worth of revenue has been opposed by the opposition. I think that there are many mums and dads all around Australia that would want to ask the question: why is it that, on every occasion that this government has brought forward measures to crack down on multinational profit shifting, they have come into this place and voted against those measures?</span>

The Assistant Treasurer talked about consultation in his answer. As the budget is written and the lockup is going on as we speak, and the market should have had this announcement tonight when everyone could have it at the same time, can he assure the House that, in his communications with the business community today, he has not created an unfair competitive advantage for those businesses he contacted?</span>

Given the minister's commendable announcements to date on improvements to the Bruce Highway involving an investment of over $4 billion, which has been applauded by the community, can the minister give a time frame for upgrading the Bruce Highway between Caboolture and the Sunshine Coast from four to six lanes to meet the needs of the area's rapidly growing population? <span style="font-style:italic;">(Time expired)</span></span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Grayndler</span>—<span class="HPS-MinisterialTitles">Leader of the House, Minister for Infrastructure and Transport and Minister for Regional Development and Local Government</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">14:33</span>):  I thank very much the member for his question and for his ongoing representations about the needs of people on the Sunshine Coast, particularly with regard to roads funding. Earlier this year, of course, I announced some $80 million in funding for a new interchange between the Bruce Highway, Roys Road and Bells Creek Road, and last month the Prime Minister and I were in Rockhampton with the member for Capricornia announcing our $4.1 billion plan for a better, safer Bruce Highway. That is real money for real projects that will make a real difference to local communities along the highway. On the Sunshine Coast, this will see the construction of a new flyover ramp to the Bruce Highway from the Sunshine Motorway. It will significantly improve safety and reduce congestion for people travelling on the Bruce Highway. It will also mean we can fast-track the next stage of Cooroy to Curra upgrade section A, where construction is on track to start next month. We have allocated $4.1 billion, making a total of $5.7 billion—four times what those opposite allocated when they were in government. We can do a range of projects that have been outlined, but we can do even more if the Queensland government comes to the party and puts up its fair share of funding, including widening the highway between Caboolture and the Sunshine Coast.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Three months ago, the opposition leader said that he would be making very substantial announcements about the Bruce Highway in coming weeks. That was three months ago. All we have heard since is radio silence, which is not surprising given the embarrassment of $1.3 billion over 12 long years of neglect that occurred under the former government. What this government has is a plan for our national road network that is about supporting jobs today through construction but also about making those productivity improvements—including, in the Sunshine Coast region just to the north, the Cooroy to Curra section B that was promised, funded, built and opened by this government after the former transport minister and local member to the north of Mr Slipper's electorate described it as the worst section of road in Australia. Those opposite have been driving up and down the highway but not making any commitments at all—no commitments. The Leader of the National Party said $8 billion one day, and then it went back to $1 billion under Joe Hockey, the shadow Treasurer. And now we know that they are saying no commitment at all.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">In the election on 14 September there will be a choice between two different sets of policies about the future of Australian workplaces and good jobs. There is one choice—the Labor way—where people can expect and deserve good jobs. We see that happening every day in Australia, with fairer and better laws under the Fair Work Act. I am pleased to report to the House that labour productivity has been up—not for one quarter, not two quarters, not three quarters—for seven quarters in a row. I am pleased to report that last Thursday, the April unemployment numbers fell. An fact, in April, there were more men and women in Australia working full-time than ever in the history of Federation.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I am also pleased to report that under the 5½ years of Labor, industrial action lost time has fallen and has been substantially lower than the 11 years of the Liberal period beforehand. I am also pleased to report that wage growth is reasonable. So there you have it. That is the Labor choice: productivity up, jobs up, industrial action down and wages moving reasonably.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I am asked if there is another choice, another set of policies. Last Thursday, after pressure, the Liberal Party revealed a bit of a sticky taped together, stapled set of press releases from employer groups and proudly brandished it as a workplace relations policy. I do congratulate the opposition policy for being classic, textbook small target: say nothing—or nearly nothing. Hope that we can say and do nothing, even though some of the hard-line right-wingers behind the Leader of the Opposition want to let loose. They want to sneak into office as they did in 2004—by not telling anyone anything. </span>

                  <span style="font-style:italic;" />Unfortunately, Liberal Party policy does let the cat out of the proverbial bag. Unfair individual contracts are back with a bullet under the Liberals. They are now proposing—I love this, I do not know who dreamed it up, but they deserve a medal for idiocy—to make law that you can swap your hourly pay for non-monetary benefits. Why didn't we think of that? What a great idea! What you can now do is take a pay cut if you vote Liberal. Fantastic! But it goes further than that. Unfair individual contracts are in the Liberal Party DNA. Look how happy other people are. The Liberals are saying that there is nothing here to see. Why did the Australian Retailers Association today come out and say, 'Good on the Liberal Party of Australia, because we can get our teeth into penalty rates'? Indeed, I have to respect the honesty of the oracle from Goldstein, because on the radio today, as the oracle does— <span style="font-style:italic;">(</span><span style="font-style:italic;">T</span><span style="font-style:italic;">ime expired)</span></span>

It is indeed the case that this government has an orderly plan for investment in the nation's infrastructure. That is why we established Infrastructure Australia to give us advice based upon cost-benefit analysis about projects, regardless of the mode. That is why it is important that we have invested, not just doubling the roads budget, but we have committed more to urban public transport than all governments combined from Federation right through to 2007. That includes, of course, in the honourable member's electorate, the Regional Rail Link, which will benefit Melbourne, but will also benefit Bendigo, Ballarat and Geelong. It is the largest single investment in urban public transport in Australia's history by any federal government. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We have not just done that. Of course, we have also had the Noarlunga to Seaford extension in Adelaide that will open later this year. We have also had the Gold Coast Rapid Transit line that is going gangbusters on the Gold Coast and will be finished by 2014. We have got the Perth Citylink project, in Perth, sinking the existing rail line through the CBD and uniting the CBD with Northbridge, transforming the city of Perth with federal investment. In Brisbane, to the north, we have the Moreton Bay regional rail link, which is also underway. We also have projects of separating freight from passenger lines that are leading to a better urban public transport system in Sydney: the Southern Sydney Freight Line, which I opened earlier this year, and the Northern Sydney Freight Line, making a big difference, where construction will start at Strathfield in coming months. Also, in Adelaide, we have the Goodwood and Torrens junctions grade separation. In addition to that, we have had money for planning: planning of the Melbourne Metro, planning of the Brisbane Cross River Rail project—important investments—as well as, in Perth, the light rail project. It is important that this occur and it has been received well by those Australians who are stuck in traffic gridlock, who know that we need to invest in urban public transport. </span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">
                  <span style="font-style:italic;" />What those opposite have had to say is that we need to stick to their knitting, that we need to abandon any investment in urban public transport whatsoever. It has been ruled out by the Leader of the Opposition—and not just that. He went on Melbourne radio and said the only urban rail project that he can recall that the Commonwealth has substantially funded is the Moreton Link in Brisbane. It was on radio in Melbourne, where 2½ thousand people are at work today on the Regional Rail Link, 2½ thousand jobs ensuring growth into the future—and he was not even aware of it.

I remind the Prime Minister of her last newsletter, sent recently to her own constituents, that has promised more than 23,000 local families will receive an increase of up to $600 in their Family Tax Benefit Part A statements and that increased payments will flow from 1 July next year. Given that the Prime Minister binned that promise before it even started, why should anyone trust her to deliver on her budget promises this year when she failed to deliver on her promises from last year?</span>

The Deputy Leader of the Opposition—and indeed all members of the House—need to grapple with the facts and what the facts mean for the government's budget position and would mean for anyone who was in government at this period of time. You cannot wish away the facts, and what the facts mean is that, since the budget was last delivered, we have seen the amount of revenue tax money expected to be received by the government go down by $17 billion. In those circumstances the government is making responsible savings. As I indicated to the Australian people when I spoke about this matter a few weeks ago, these decisions are grave and weighty ones, but we are determined to take the right decisions to ensure that we have a focus on jobs and growth, that we chart a pathway to surplus and that we are making the smart investments necessary for the nation's future. That is the approach that the government has taken, and of course on election day Australians will have the opportunity to judge that approach versus the approach of the opposition to cut to the bone. I note that the Deputy Leader of the Opposition did not come to the dispatch box and spruik about the opposition's plan to rip away the Schoolkids Bonus from Australian families, to make Australian families with school children worse off and to take the money out of their purses and wallets that they are using to support the costs of getting the kids to school. I note that she did not come to the dispatch box and say that they are planning to put up tax. They want people to pay more tax, particularly working women, because, whilst we have increased the tax-free threshold so a million Australians have come out of the tax system, so that you do not pay tax now until you earn more than $18,200—</span>

                    <span class="HPS-MemberAnswer">Mr STEPHEN SMITH</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Perth</span>—<span class="HPS-MinisterialTitles">Minister for Defence and Deputy Leader of the House</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">14:51</span>):  I thank the member for his question and acknowledge his longstanding interest in national security matters, particularly our maritime security and the capability of Adelaide to be at the heart and centre of that. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The Prime Minister and I released the Defence white paper on 3 May and that provides the strategic analysis which fits Australia for our future national security challenges. The strategic analysis in the white paper has been widely regarded as a sensible and careful analysis of those future challenges and risks. It provides a road map for us to protect and enhance Australia's national security interests.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The white paper outlines, in the government's view, the formation of a new strategic entity which we describe as the Indo-Pacific. This reflects not just the rise of China but also the rise of India. The paper draws attention to the essential need for the United States-China relationship to be a positive and productive one, and particularly for that relationship to grow from an economic relationship to a relationship at the same level in the political, strategic, defence-to-defence and military-to-military area.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We also acknowledged the importance of the United States rebalance and some of the current issues facing Australia: a drawdown from Afghanistan, Timor Leste and the Solomons, and our own force posture review reflected by the first force posture review in over 25 years.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">And so the strategic analysis sets out those challenges. The capability decisions made in the white paper allow the Australian Defence Force, the ADF, to meet those challenges for the future and to discharge the obligations given to it by the government. The two primary decisions made in the white paper so far as capability is concerned are the purchase of 12 off-the-production-line Growler electronic warfare capability aircraft to add to our 24 Super Hornets and to our 71 classic Hornets and, importantly, a narrowing of our capability decision so far as our 12 submarines to be assembled in South Australia are concerned: to an evolved Collins model or to a brand-new design—in contrast to those opposite, through their shadow minister, who look only at an off-the-shelf foreign purchase.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I have seen a lot of comment made about finance in this area. The white paper does respond to the adverse implications of the global financial crisis. I have also seen reference that the fact that we are not currently at two per cent of GDP spending creates a crisis in defence spending. We remain the 13th largest defence spender, and if you think there is a crisis in defence spending because we are not at two per cent of GDP then I regret to advise the House that we have had that crisis since 1999. We have not had two per cent of GDP since that time. We have an aspiration to go to two per cent, but we have a bipartisanship approach here to defence spending: everyone has an aspiration to two per cent, but that has not been met in reality since 1999. <span style="font-style:italic;">(Time expired)</span></span>

If you have two kids going to school, across their schooling careers it will make a difference of $15,000 for a family. And who wants to take that away? None other than the Leader of the Opposition.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">Then, of course, we are working with Australian families on cost-of-living pressures that they face—for example, the historic increase in the pension that this government has delivered because we understand that for Australian pensioners it is hard to make ends meet.

And there is the Leader of the Opposition saying that he is going to have a scheme for nannies that he is going to fund from that money that currently goes to families. All that means is that there are going to be cutbacks for families that are getting childcare benefit and childcare tax rebate now.</span>

Because of the structure of this tax-free threshold, this is a benefit that makes a difference particularly for working women; particularly for women, for second-income earners, who are seeking to combine part-time work with caring for children. And who wants to take that benefit away, and ensure that those low-income Australians—those working women, predominantly—pay more tax? None other than the Leader of the Opposition.

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Isaacs</span>—<span class="HPS-MinisterialTitles">Attorney-General, Minister for Emergency Management, Minister for the Public Service and Integrity and Special Minister of State</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">14:58</span>):  I thank the member for Greenway for her question. I know she has a very long-standing interest and strong track record in developing productive partnerships between federal government and local governments for the benefit of local communities. The member for Greenway was, of course, the Deputy Mayor of Blacktown before standing to represent her community in our federal parliament.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Since 1901 the Constitution has served Australia very well but we must ensure that it remains a living and a relevant document, one which reflects the reality of government and the provision of essential community services in Australia. The proposed change to section 96 of the Constitution is a modest and a practical change. Section 96, of course, currently allows the granting of financial assistance to any state on such terms and conditions as the parliament sees fit. The proposed amendment would simply acknowledge the fact that the Commonwealth has partnered with local governments for decades to deliver local roads, sporting fields, libraries, child care and vital community services. The roads that we drive down every day, the football fields, the new changing sheds that our kids use on the weekends, the modern learning centres that are being built in new suburbs—many of these have been made possible by local and federal governments working together.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I also want to make clear what this amendment does not do. It does not give the Commonwealth any ability to interfere with the creation or regulation of local government bodies by the states. The proposed change of course follows extensive consultation and development by the expert panel convened in 2011 and chaired by Jim Spigelman. It was endorsed by a joint select committee chaired by the member for Greenway and supported by members of parliament from across politics.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">History shows that only a referendum with bipartisan federal support has any chance of being agreed at the ballot box on 14 September, and we therefore welcome the support of the opposition for this practical change to our Constitution and look forward to working with the opposition members to explain this change to the people of Australia. National Party members in particular understand the benefits arising from partnerships between federal government and local governments which serve to develop and strengthen their electorates. So let's work together with the Australian people to say yes to recognising local government in our Constitution.</span>

I remind the Prime Minister that in last year's budget Labor promised to keep gross debt below $250 billion, bring the budget back to surplus and increase family tax benefit part A. In 2011 Labor promised to create 500,000 new jobs, and in 2010 it promised to cut company tax. Given that Labor has broken every single one of these budget promises, why should the Australian people believe anything that is promised tonight?</span>

The member will see tonight's budget when the Treasurer delivers it at 7:30 tonight, and what I can assure the member is that it is a budget based on the facts, right for these economic circumstances, focused on jobs as this government has always been focused on jobs—960,000 jobs, almost a million, created since this government came to office, an economy 13 per cent larger despite having to face the biggest economic shock the globe has seen since the Great Depression.

The member opposite and, indeed, all those members opposite might be interested to know that former Prime Minister Howard was prepared to take an approach based on the facts when it comes to tonight's budget and, indeed, the government's budget in general. He said on 13 May, very recently:</span>

                <span class="HPS-Small">We are still fortunate that we have an unemployment rate with a five in front of it. I wouldn't have thought that was going to be possible a couple of years ago, and I don't think many people would have. Our unemployment has remained pleasingly quite low.</span>

I am very pleased to say that since this parliament last met the forestry deal has been endorsed by the Tasmanian parliament and is now being rolled out. This is something that ends 30 years of conflict in Tasmanian forestry and has extraordinary outcomes for both Tasmanian jobs and conservation.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We have had a significant shift in the forestry industry for some time now. Markets that we used to be able to rely on started to disappear or demand that they would only buy timber product, whether it be woodchip, peeler billet or sawlog, if it had the Forest Stewardship Council certification on it. None of the native forestry run by Forestry Tasmania was eligible at that point for FSC certification. Now, with the agreement in place, we are seeing the process for certification for the export of timber products from Tasmania moving quickly.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Tasmania will be leading the nation. It will be the one state whose official forestry body has gained Forest Stewardship Council certification and which has opened itself up to those export markets around the world. On the different exit packages that have been offered I have heard the comments of the Leader of the Opposition, who has said that his side of politics would never pay people to leave, completely forgetting the exit packages over the years, pretending they never happened. What will occur is where people have already seen the massive drop-off in demand they now have an opportunity to take up that slack through the exit packages and then reinvest in their businesses. This is a good outcome for jobs in Tasmania. This opens Tasmanian forestry products back up to the world. At the same time it means that conservation outcomes that previously would have been thought to be completely unattainable are now possible. We now have in the order of half a million hectares of forestry reserves coming into place, taking in some areas within the Tarkine, areas such as the Blue Tier. But the most highly contested forests, areas like the Weld, the Styx and the Upper Florentine, are currently before the World Heritage Committee in Paris to enable them to get the full level of conservation protection and to be put on the World Heritage List.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">This is something where the conflict options that have been there for the last 30 years have been entirely rejected by this government. We have worked with stakeholders, with the Tasmanian people, who have wanted to move to a future that is very different from the past with a combination of conservation and jobs. <span style="font-style:italic;">(Time expired)</span></span>

He has always been there. All those jobs are possible only because we have moved beyond the old conflict model. The old conflict model was killing our international markets, which are now opened up. Most of the people who will be taking up the exit packages will be using that money to reinvest back into jobs in the north-west, in the southern forests, across the eastern forests—throughout Tasmania. What we have there is the opposite of what the Liberal Party would have wanted. They have had terror at the thought that there might not be conflict. The moment they thought we could actually have a thing called peace in the forests nothing has scared them more, because their whole political approach in Tasmania has thrived on the conflict model. Seats like the seat of Lyons, the seat of Franklin and the seat of Bass have always thrived on the concept of jobs. They have always thrived on the concept of making sure that we adapt to the changes in the market and that we do not pretend that a battle from 30 years ago is going to provide a sustainable future for Tasmanians. It is about making sure that we look at where markets have gone and that we work with the Tasmanian community to make sure that the economic future that members like the member for Lyons have been demanding is well and truly within the grasp of Tasmanians.</span>

                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Mr MORRISON</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Cook</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">15:12</span>):  The Treasurer will get to his feet tonight and engage in what can only be described as another act of fiscal fantasy. Such will be the fictional nature of what the Treasurer will say tonight that I suggest that he begins his budget speech with the phrase 'Once upon a time …'. What will be true about tonight's revelations by the Treasurer is that while Labor's record failures on our borders mean that they have not been able to stop the boats those record failures under this Treasurer have, however, ensured that they have been able to stop a surplus.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Labor's record border failures have no peer. That is why they are records. This afternoon there is an opportunity to go through in some detail the nature of those border failures, which are entirely an act of this government's own making. What is important is to understand the impacts and consequences of this record level of failure.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Under this government, what we have seen occur in the short space of time of just five years is an average of two people illegally entering Australia by boat every month in 2007-08 expanded this financial year to an average of over 2,000 per month. From two per month to over 2,000 per month: that is an extraordinary act of growth on this government in terms of the border failures that we have seen—it is absolutely extraordinary. It is important to note that, over this period of time, what we have seen is a constancy in the level of pressures that have been brought to bear. As we all know, push factors are, sadly, a tragedy that is always present. What changes is government policy that enables the border failures to present as they have under this government. So we have gone from an average of two per month to over 2,000 per month. And just this year we have set two monthly records. In March we had a record of over 2,500. In April we had a record of over 3,300. And in May, in just less than 10 days, we have had over 1,500 people arrive in this manner. We had a record last financial year, 2011-12, of 8,300 people arrive, and more; but this financial year we have had a record of 20,861 people arrive in this manner—and we are not even at the end of the year yet.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">What we also note is one of the other records this government achieved in 2011-12—the 2012-13 figures will be released at some time. I will refer here to the Parliamentary Library publication which refers to IMA refugee status determination requests received—that is, those who have arrived by boat. In 2011-12 the figure for those who came by boat was 7,379. For those who came by air, it was 7,036. For the first time, in 2011-12, more people came by boat than came by air, according to the Parliamentary Library and the Department of Immigration and Citizenship. That was at a time when the arrivals for that year were 8,300. This year they are almost 21,000, and we are not even at the end of the year, so one can only imagine the disparity between the figures.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">That is the record, but what has been the impact? This government, while in government and in opposition, always took the opportunity to lecture the coalition side of politics on the morality of their policies. One area in particular where it was particularly keen to talk about the impact of the Howard government's policies was the impact on children. But this government's record, because of these record arrivals, is that more children are turning up on boats than at any other time in our nation's history. In this financial year alone, more than 3,000 children have come on the boats. That is up on around 2,000 in the year before that and around 1,000 the year before that. It is estimated that around 40 per cent of those coming on boats now are in family groups. In addition, we have more than 2,000 children who are in the detention network as we speak and over 1,000 of those are in formal detention itself. The previous peak was back in 2000-01, which was under the Howard government, and it was 1,344.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The government have set the record for children coming on boats, flowing as a consequence from their failed policies. So their lecturing and their hectoring of the Howard government over our border policies and their impact on children is dumbfounded by their own record. They should be ashamed of themselves, with their grand acts of pretence to compassion. Their policies have put those children on boats for years, and now in record numbers. They should be aware of their own record of failures and of the impact: when you fail on the borders, children and families get on boats. That has occurred in record numbers under the government.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">It was the Prime Minister herself in 2010 and the former minister, Minister Bowen, who said they were going to remove children out of formal detention. There were about 750 in detention at that time. Today there are more than a thousand. She said:</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Small">We did not believe that children should be held … in high-security detention … And so, we have worked to have more appropriate accommodation for family groups and for children.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">What that turns out to be is more children now in formal detention and, if that is not enough, they have just announced they are going to build more facilities at Curtin and at Wickham Point to take more children into formal detention and, as the minister himself has said, for a period of around 120 days. That is the consequence, the implications and the impact of the government's failed border policies. The hypocrisy is breathtaking. If they are going to make those accusations and criticisms of the Howard government policy then it is time to look in the mirror of their own policy record and policy failings.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The record detention population today is a result of the record level of arrivals. We had four people in immigration detention who had arrived illegally by boat in November 2007. Today? I should say at the end of February, because the government have not released the figures since the end of February, but there were 7,528 at the end of February and another 10,000 on top of that who are on bridging visas.</span>
              </p>

                    <span class="HPS-MemberContinuation">Mr MORRISON:</span>
                  </a>  No amount of shouting from those opposite will change that fact. It will not change the fact that 17,528 people, at least at the end of February, had arrived illegally by boat and were in detention. Since the end of February there have been over 7,500 more who have turned up. So on top of these record figures even more have arrived. And if we go to just in May, we know that there were 2,962 people on Christmas Island. I do not need to remind the government, I suppose, that when they burnt down, and the Australian Federal Police had to retake by force, the facility on Christmas Island there were roughly 2,500 in the facility at that time. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The compounding border failures of this government continue to compound the problems and the impacts that flow from that, which are children getting on boats, children going into detention, and detention centres overcrowding and overloading. The riots and various other things that we have seen that flow as a consequence of those things stem from one key problem: a failure to be able to deliver on the responsibility of a government to protect our borders and ensure proper border security.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Labor is putting the consequences of their failed policies off to the other side of the election, and they did this before at the last election as well. Before the last election, Senator Evans was the minister who failed to act on recommendations and reports, which were coming through his department at the time, that said that more detention capacity needed to be created, and he sat on his hands. It was only after the election that the incoming minister, who was given that hospital pass by Senator Evans, went and, I admit, expanded that network—and we commended him at the time—but it was all too late. The consequences of that stalling before the last election were already set in train, and nothing the government could even do at that stage would be able to take them off the fast train they were on to the crisis that we saw in the immigration detention network, which literally exploded in February, March and April of the following year.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We are seeing the same thing happen again today, because there are currently around 18,255 people who have turned up on boats since 14 August last year and what we do know is the government have not been processing the people that have turned up since that time. So what we have now is a detention population, and a population within the system more broadly, that is growing by the thousands and currently sits around an estimated level of 18,000 to 20,000. I am happy for the government to confirm the numbers and give me a fresh number if they have got one, but by the time we get to an election that number could well be over 30,000 of a backlog in the system, pushing the consequences and responsibilities for dealing with this issue until after an election.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">All of this comes at a record cost, and the record cost of this government is spectacular. Since the last election alone, the blow-out in the government's budget—actual figures from the government's budget based on the estimates released in February this year—is $5.2 billion. They said it would cost something just over $1 billion, and it ended up costing, based on the estimates we have at the end of February, $6 billion plus—a $5.2 billion blow-out since the last election. So tonight the Treasurer has the opportunity to be honest in the budget and tell us what the real costs over the next few years will be. If you simply just put into the budget for the next three years what the estimated cost for this year is then the Treasurer has a $5 billion hole in the budget as we speak today. The Treasurer will need to detail tonight whether he is going to budget on this issue on the basis of the coalition's policies that will stop the boats or he is going to budget on the policies of his own government that have failed to stop the boats. If that budget tonight does not come up with at least the $5 billion that is missing currently in the estimates, then he must be budgeting for a change of government, because that is the only way we are going to see a change in those figures.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The budget blow-outs are extraordinary and they are costing Australians every single day. They have led to record chaos more broadly in the immigration department and they have led to the chaos we have seen not just in immigration detention but also in the bridging visa program in the community. We have now seen the government not engage in a policy of community release; we have seen the government engage in a policy of community dumping. This is a government that is dumping people into the community with no care and no responsibility—out of sight, out of mind. It is putting more and more pressure on the charitable organisations that are out there and other service providers who have to step into the gap created by this government.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Do not kid yourself that this government has somehow embarked on this policy of bridging visas out of a sense of compassion. They have embarked on this policy because they cannot cope with the level of arrivals. Not only did the detention network get overrun—they had to let single males out on bridging visas—but now the community detention facilities have been overrun and they are now going to dump families into the same situation we have seen single adult males in over the last 18 months. So it is not surprising that the Salvation Army's Major Paul Moulds has said:</span>

The coalition's alternative has always been there for this government to adopt, and they have used excuse after excuse not to embrace that and they still continue to do that today. That will not change between now and the election, and so the opportunity at the election is to change the government and change the outcome by changing the policy. That is what the Australian people will have the opportunity to do on 14 September.</span>

Unfortunately, all of my fears have been well founded. On 25 January this year, Customs intercepted a boat 17 nautical miles off Christmas Island that was carrying 15 people. The people on board reported that four men had left on a makeshift raft of inner tubes and bamboo poles approximately 24 hours earlier in a bid to swim to Christmas Island. A search was commenced, and on 30 January one man was found at Ethel Beach on Christmas Island. He was reported saying that four men had been separated from the raft, possibly as it broke up. Those three other men have never been found.</span>

It was reported that two more asylum seekers perished. In March, minutes after being boarded by two border protection officers, a vessel capsized after being struck by two freak waves. Ninety-four people were rescued, two people died, and one of those people was a young boy. In April, another vessel crashed off the coast of Indonesia with 66 people on board; 14 were rescued, 52 have still not been recovered—presumed perished.</span>

That is what this debate is about, or at least it is what this debate should be about. But it is a debate that has been poisoned by politics—by politicians seeking political advantage. That is the reason that we are debating this and why this debate has gone on now for almost 12 years. It is not about the policy as much as it is about the politics. I made this point last year in the same debate. We agree on most of the policy. The differences here are really at the margins. It is the politics that are poisoning this debate and, if you want proof of that, there is no better place to look than the contribution by David Marr in his <span style="font-style:italic;">Quarterly Essay</span> where, at page 36, he talks about the WikiLeaks cable that showed what was happening back in 2009.

              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Small">In late 2009, in the dying days of Malcolm Turnbull's leadership of the Opposition, a "key Liberal party strategist" popped in to the US embassy in Canberra to say how pleased the party was that refugee boats were, once again, making their way to Christmas Island. The issue was 'fantastic', he said. And 'the more boats that come the better.' But he admitted they had yet to find a way to make the issue work in their favour: his research indicated only a 'slight trend' towards the Coalition."</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">There you have a senior Liberal Party strategist in the US embassy saying 'the more boats … the better' and it is a pity that it has not yet worked well enough as a political device. That is why we are having this debate. That is why the Liberal Party refuses to allow the government to implement our own policies—because of Liberal Party strategists who think the more boats is in their political interest.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We do not agree on everything, but on big issues of life and death where people's lives are at risk we should agree on this principle: that the government of the day—Labor or Liberal or whatever it might be—should be given the power that it thinks it needs to stop people getting on boats and perishing at sea. That is what the Labor Party did in opposition in 2001 when John Howard asked for more powers after the <span style="font-style:italic;">Tampa</span>. That is what John Howard would do now if John Howard were the Leader of the Opposition.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">But that is what we are being denied right now by both the Liberal Party and by the Greens, who have refused to give us the powers that this government genuinely believes will help to stop people getting onto boats and risking their lives. That is why we are here. That is why we are having this debate—because of the politics, because of the fight for political advantage. I am sick of it. The people of Australia are sick of it. They are sick of this fighting and they want us to work together.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">So what works? We know this: the fear of drowning has not put people off; offshore processing has not put people off; but the threat of being flown back has. The threat of being flown back home has had a significant impact. Last year there was a big increase in the number of people coming to Australia by boat from Sri Lanka—more than 5,000 people. Most of these people are not refugees. They are economic migrants, people looking for a better life, people looking for a job. They are not entitled to asylum in Australia. Last year we made the decision to screen these people quickly and fly them back when it was determined that they were not refugees. The impact of flying people back to Sri Lanka has been dramatic. The number of boats coming to Australia from Sri Lanka has dropped significantly. In the last four months of last year there were 70 boats coming to Australia from Sri Lanka. So far this year, there have been seven. This shows that flybacks work. The fear of death does not put people off, but the fear of being sent home a few days or a few weeks after they set out to sea certainly does. It shows how critical this is in stopping people getting onto boats and risking their lives. If we want to stop the boats, we have got to do this, and we have to do it elsewhere.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The biggest group of people coming to Australia by boat at the moment are people from Iran, and like most of the people coming from Sri Lanka, most of them are economic migrants. They are not fleeing persecution; they are looking for a better life; they are looking for a job. They are not entitled to asylum. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">But unlike Sri Lankans, we cannot fly them home. Unlike Sri Lanka, the country of Iran refuses to take them so we cannot fly them back. But what we can do is fly them halfway back. We can fly them back to the countries they transit through to get on a boat to come to Australia. And one of those countries is Malaysia. The fear of death, as I said, does not put people off, but the threat of being sent back home does. That is why the plan to fly people back to Malaysia is an important part of the solution. Flybacks work, and if you cannot fly people all the way back to Iran, fly them halfway back, to Malaysia. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The agreement with Malaysia is limited. But it is a start. It is one that we Australians can build on with them and it is the type of program that we can do with other transit countries. In many senses, it is the same as the opposition's pushback policy except for this important difference: it is safer, a lot safer. This is what we have to do, I sincerely believe, if we are going to reduce the incentive for people to get on a boat and risk their lives.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Here is the frustrating part of this: the opposition has refused to give us the power to implement this policy, a policy that we think will reduce the risk of people dying. Their argument is that you cannot fly people back to Malaysia because they are not signatories to the UN convention on refugees. That is a fake excuse. It has been contrived as something to hide behind. Their own pushback policy is designed to send people back to another country that also has not signed the UN convention on refugees, and that is Indonesia. Our policy is exactly the same, only safer. The opposition say that if they are elected they will push back boats where it is safe to do so. My question is: when is it safe to do so? The answer to that question is, of course, never. That is the advice of the Navy and that is what experience tells us. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I have gone back and I have had a look at the attempts by the Howard government to push boats back in the past, and what happened in those instances is revealing. SIEV I on 7 September 2001 showed that Navy personnel were threatened and forced to withdraw after they boarded the vessel. On SIEV II on 9 September 2001, there were 30 knives found concealed on the boat and the passengers threatened self-harm. On SIEV III on 11 September 2001, naval personnel were met with violence and they could not control the wheelhouse. The boarding party had to leave the vessel. On SIEV V on 12 October 2001, equipment was thrown overboard and the boat was sabotaged. SIEV VI on 19 October 2001 was also sabotaged. When naval personnel attempted to repair the ship, fires were started, the deck boards were turned up and the boat ended up sinking. SIEV VII on 22 October had 15 people dive overboard; others doused themselves in fuel. They damaged the mast and started a fire in the hold </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">SIEV IX on 31 October 2001 was also sabotaged—fuel lines were cut. On SIEV XII on 16 December 2001 there was more sabotage, more fires and more threats of self-harm. This is what happens when you attempt to push boats back; it is why the Navy say it is not safe to do this. That is why I am making the argument today that a much better option, a much safer option and proven effective option, is to fly people back.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Perhaps the best example of how dangerous this practice is, and how dangerous this practice would be, is what happened with SIEV XXXVI in 2009. This was not a boat that was turned around, but the people who were on the boat thought that they were about to be turned back. This is what Coroner Greg Cavanagh said in his subsequent report:</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Small">…the vessel's engine was sabotaged and subsequent petrol was spilt into the bilge and ignited.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">There was an explosion; five asylum seekers drowned, 40 people were injured, including ADF personnel, who were subsequently treated for burns and other injuries. The important point here is that what happened in this terrible incident could have been much, much worse. The coroner, Greg Cavanagh, says that one of the ADF personnel, Corporal Jager—a medical officer—would have died if not for the efforts to rescue her. In his findings he found that all of this happened on this vessel because the people on the boat thought that the boat was going to be turned around. That is why the Navy has criticised the idea of turning boats back. That is why they say that it is never safe to do so because it puts the lives of their men and women at risk.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Compare all of that—compare all the chaos of what happened on these boats and what happened on SIEV XXXIV—to the policy of flying people back: boarding the vessel and getting the people who are on the boat, putting them on a plane and flying them safely back, whether it is Sri Lanka or whether it is Malaysia. It is a lot safer, we have proven that it is much more effective and it is something they can and should be rolled out more broadly.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">This is not easy stuff; it is very hard. It is a wretchedly difficult area of policy, and the opposition know that. We have seen in recent weeks the opposition leader saying that instead of stopping the boats he will 'reduce the boats'. This is difficult but there is a way through. As I say, it involves flying people back; that means legislation. It means we have to work together. We have been fighting about this since <span style="font-style:italic;">Tampa</span>—for more than a decade. The issue has been rancid with politics ever since. As I have said in this debate—and as I have said elsewhere—all we are saying is that the government of the day should be given the power that it thinks it needs to stop people dying at sea. We think that is fly-backs. The evidence shows that it works. We need the Liberal Party and we need the Greens to let us do that. While ever we do not, more people will come and more people will die. That is just a simple fact. And that should weigh on the minds of all of us here. These are not just numbers; they are people. They are mothers, they are fathers, they are sisters, they are brothers, they are boys and girls and we should condemn the political strategists I quoted earlier who say, 'the more boats the better'. That sort of attitude diminishes all of us; we are better than that. I am disgusted by those comments. I think all my colleagues on both sides of the House should be disgusted by those sort of comments. This is not going to be solved with politics. It is going to be solved with policies. With every boat there is the risk of death. We have seen too much death in the past few years. We have seen too much death in the past few months. If we are going to stop this we need to work together and that involves voting for one simple piece of legislation which is before this parliament. I ask all members to support that legislation and fly people back to Malaysia.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Stirling</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">15:42</span>):  The MPI that we are discussing today is about the consequences of the terrible failure of the Labor Party to control our borders since they came to office. Members will know—and of course this will be revealed later tonight in the budget—about the cost to Australian taxpayers of what is possibly Labor's most significant policy failure since arriving on the treasury bench in 2007.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We also know, and we know very well, about the enormous toll that it has taken on people who have sought the services of a people smuggler and drowned in the attempt to come to Australia. I want to highlight some of the other consequences of this failure to control our borders—issues that have not been raised as extensively in this place, but very serious issues that go to national security in Australia.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Clearly, when you have a circumstance of criminals being in charge of who comes to Australia, and when there is enormous weakness on our borders, criminals will seek to exploit that weakness in the same way that if you leave your doors unlocked that criminals will seek to exploit this sort of weakness if they come to burgle your home. It is the same if you are not controlling your borders—criminals will eye the opportunities that are available to them through that policy failure. When you have over 40,000 people having arrived here courtesy of people smugglers, it is clearly impossible for us to rigorously assess the background of everyone who arrives in this way. I want to make clear that the vast majority of people who arrive using the services of a people smuggler are not in this category. But, clearly, when you are talking about such a large number of people, the opportunity for people of bad character to arrive by paying a people smuggler is very real and we would be naive and we would be foolish to overlook the fact that criminals will exploit the border weaknesses that have resulted from the Labor Party's policy failures.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I wanted to talk about a few cases in particular that have been highlighted in the media, but that we have not had an opportunity to highlight in the parliament. I want to call on the government to use the parliament to explain the circumstances surrounding three cases that I am going to raise. The three I am talking about were highlighted in a report in the <span style="font-style:italic;">West Australian </span>toward the end of last month. They are people who have arrived here by paying a people smuggler. One is an accused Egyptian terrorist, one is an alleged Sri Lankan murderer and the third is an Iranian who is apparently wanted for drug trafficking in his home country. The cases were revealed in a report in the <span style="font-style:italic;">West Australian</span>. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">What is most concerning about this is, first, the fact that people of this character would have used the services of a people smuggler to get here. Second, and most important, is the manner in which they have been treated since they have arrived. That report revealed that the accused Egyptian terrorist was the subject of an Interpol red notice, the highest level of alert from Interpol. That should have said to Australian law-enforcement authorities that this was somebody who needed to be apprehended on arrival in the country. A red notice is essentially an international arrest warrant.</span>

                  </a>  The Attorney-General—and I will just get this on the record—is foolish enough to keep interjecting, saying the man is in detention. I am talking about the manner in which he was detained. There is a very big difference between being held in Inverbrackie, a low-security environment, and being held in Villawood, where apparently this person was moved once the media reported on the circumstances of his detention.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The question for ministers like the Attorney-General is: why would an accused Egyptian terrorist be held with such a low-security environment? I would really welcome the Attorney-General taking the opportunity in the parliament to respond to that. Why would you put somebody, an accused terrorist subject to an Interpol red notice, within a low-security detention environment? This is the question that the government has refused to answer. The question is: did the immigration minister even know that he had a person subject to such serious allegations or perhaps even convictions? We do not know. Did he even know that this person was held within such a low-security environment, because once the media report was published in the <span style="font-style:italic;">West Australian</span> on the Saturday apparently the government then took action to move this person from Inverbrackie to Villawood? The question for ministers like the Attorney-General, who is supposed to actually protect Australia's national security, is: why would a person of such a character be placed within such a low-security environment? I hope that the Attorney-General takes the opportunity to answer that question to the Australian people in the parliament today.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The Sri Lankan who was accused of murdering his girlfriend was not held in low-security detention. He was released into community detention, again something that seems highly and totally inappropriate for somebody accused of such a serious crime. I wrote to the Minister for Immigration and Citizenship asking him why. The first question I posed to him—and a question that he has not answered—is: was he even aware that he had these three people within the detention network? I posed that question to him because he only took action after these cases appeared in the media. I also posed some other questions that he has so far refused to answer, even though he has responded to my letter, but unfortunately he has not responded to the questions that I put to him.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I asked when did he become aware that he was housing within the detention network people who have been accused of such serious crimes. What action had he taken to assure that appropriate security in these cases was available to manage the risk of flight in the community? When somebody is being released into community detention, clearly there are serious questions to be asked about managing that flight risk. I asked, for each case, when did the individuals arrive and in what boat? Where were they located now and what is the current status of their refugee assessment? Finally, how have these accusations been further investigated, by whom and what are the implications for the findings of their refugee assessments?</span>
              </p>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">The minister did respond to my letter but he did not address any of these questions that have been put to him. They are serious questions on which he owes the Australian people an explanation as to what has gone on here. Sure, people are going to exploit the weaknesses of the Labor Party's failed border protection policies, but it raises very serious concerns when they are housed in such low-security detention environments. The minister by his letter to me and by his public comments has given every indication that he had absolutely no idea that this was happening until he was alerted by the <span style="font-style:italic;">West Australian</span> newspaper. He was asked on 22 April, for example, on 6PR radio in Perth about the specific people by the radio commentator Howard Sattler. The minister said that he was going to get a brief on it, which really strikes me as somebody who had no idea what was going on within the detention network. Two days later, on Sky News, he was asked about these cases as well. His response was that he was going to examine the circumstances. This is clearly a case, as so often we see with this government, of them doing something well and truly after the horse has bolted. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The Australian people are owed an explanation as to what has gone on in all three of these cases. The most serious is that of the accused Egyptian terrorist who was the subject of an Interpol red notice. One of the reasons the government is struggling to cope with looking at the security background of the 40,000-odd people who have arrived here courtesy of a people smuggler is that they have astonishingly cut the budget that ASIO has to conduct these character assessments. In last year's budget, $6.9 million was cut out of the ASIO budget for them to conduct character assessments of people who have arrived here on illegal boats. That I think is an astonishing fact that goes to the heart of Labor's failure to protect national security in these instances. We now have an apparently light touch character assessment that does not even seem to establish the identity of a person before giving them what is essentially a tick and flick exercise. These are very serious allegations on which the government owes an explanation to the Australian people and I call on them to use this parliament to provide that explanation.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">
                  <a href="HW9" type="MemberSpeech">
                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Mr CHAMPION</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Wakefield</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">15:52</span>):  This is a long debate, isn't it? We have had debates before on boat arrivals and we will probably have them again before this parliament rises and the election happens. It is a long debate for a reason. There are 46 million displaced people around the world. Periodically it has been a national debate since about the middle of the 1970s. It is very interesting to look at the different national approaches we have taken over that time.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Not many people understand that a mere 1,700 or so Vietnamese boat people arrived here in the 1970s. There were 111 in 1976, about 868 in 1978 and about 304 in 1979. There were two approaches that could have been taken by the Labor Party at that time. We could have sought to demonise these people and take political advantage of it or we could have sought to work with the government to resolve the issue. It is a great credit to Mick Young and Ian Macphee, the then minister, that those members of the House got together and put together an agreement to resolve that issue and bring people here by an appropriate mechanism rather than having them risk their lives by coming here by boat.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Fast forward to the Howard era. You hear the opposition talking about the glories of the Howard era, but of course Howard fixed a problem that he had presided over. In 1999, 3,700 people arrived by boat. In the year 2000, 2,939 people arrived by boat. In 2001, 5,516 people arrived here by boat. I am not seeking to blame the former Prime Minister. He introduced TPVs, but they had very little effect. Some 4,000 people arrived after that. Those movements were not driven by domestic policy; they were driven by people being displaced by wars in places like Afghanistan and Iraq. Through a combination of events that number shrank to very little the next year—one, and then we got a few more along the way.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">What was the Labor Party's approach during that time? It was to support the Howard government. Let us look at this opposition. We heard from the minister how they bragged to the American Embassy. We heard about the cables. A Liberal Party strategist bragged to the US Embassy about what a great issue this is for them. Despite the government's attempt to bring a rational, less heated, less partisan approach to this debate and commissioning the expert panel, what we have seen from the opposition is partisanship. This MPI reeks of a dark partisanship and the speeches given in support of it reek of a dark partisanship with the politics of division, florid language and aspersions being cast on the government's motives and their competence. We see all the Nixonian tricks you would expect from an opposition bent on serving its own interests rather than the national interest. That is I think the whole approach of the Liberal Party in this area. They have sought to gain partisan advantage at a time of national crisis.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The tragedy is that the opposition really are as sanctimonious as they are partisan. You hear sanctimonious reciting of the great triumphs of the Howard government but never talk about the amount of people who came here during those years. They never talk about the thousands that arrived during those years. They never talk about the fact that, even if the former Prime Minister solved a problem, it was a problem that had occurred on his watch. It did not occur on Labor's watch; it occurred during the Howard years—1999, 2000 and 2001. Let us not forget that the Howard government had the benefit of a parliamentary majority and an opposition that supported the government and did not, most importantly, frustrate its ability to act.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">What have we seen from this opposition? Rejection of the Malaysian transfer agreement. After all of their rhetoric and sanctimonious lecturing about offshore processing, they marched into this parliament, sided with the Greens, not just in this House but in the Senate, and prevented the government from acting. It was an extraordinary thing for them to do given how sanctimonious and partisan they have been on this subject.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We need to talk about the facts of this year. You hear the opposition talking about arrivals, and there have been serious numbers of arrivals. There were more than 6,000 Sri Lankan irregular maritime arrivals in 2012-13 compared to 1,356 in the previous year. That is a significant increase. We know that is in part because there has been terrible strife in Sri Lanka. There have been a couple of hundred thousand people herded into barbed wire camps and a very serious war. Notwithstanding that very serious war, we know that some of those people are coming here for economic reasons and that is why, since that time, we have sent 1,073 people back to Sri Lanka.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">As a government we are using all the tools available to us in order to deal with this issue. We have not sought from the opposition partisanship, sanctimonious lectures and entirely self-serving history lessons; we have always sought from the opposition cooperation in the national interest—the same cooperation that Mick Young gave Ian Macphee and the same cooperation that Kim Beazley gave former Prime Minister John Howard. Instead, what have we got from the opposition? No matter what the facts, no matter what the expert panel recommends and no matter what the Australian people want, the opposition are dedicated to coming into this parliament and frustrating the government's ability to do anything. They rejected the Malaysian transfer agreement, rejected the prospects of transfer agreements with other countries, demonised Malaysia for their attempts to cooperate with the government and rejected the expert panel—not just its recommendations but the prospect of it. They rejected its authority. They deliberately set out to undermine it. They said: 'It doesn't matter what the expert panel say, we'll reject it. We won't listen to them, because we know best.' They have undermined regional cooperation and the Bali process. They have attacked Malaysia. They have second-guessed Indonesia. They have refused to acknowledge what Indonesia has said—what the foreign minister and the chair of the foreign affairs committee have said over there. It does not matter what the Indonesians say. 'No, don't worry about them; we'll push the boats back.' That is what the opposition are telling people.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">They have embraced a dangerous policy—this idea that you can turn boats back safely. Well, you cannot, and everybody knows you cannot. The Navy has told the parliament that you cannot, because, as the Navy's tactics change, so will the people smugglers'. We know that they are far more ruthless than we are, so they will burn boats. If you want some evidence of it, listen to Vice Admiral Ray Griggs, who said:</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Small">… there were incidents during these activities, as there have been incidents subsequently, which have been risky. There have been fires lit, there have been attempts to storm the engine compartment of these boats, there have been people jumping in the water and that sort of thing … yes, there are obviously risks involved in this process.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">That is what the head of the Navy says. The opposition say, 'We're going to embrace this policy,' and they do not care what the evidence is. They do not care what the feedback is; they are going to do it.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">This is an amazingly dangerous and short-sighted approach for the opposition to take, because they have set expectations very high indeed about the consequences of their policies, haven't they? Their rhetoric and their florid partisanship, their dark partisanship, have—let's face it—inflamed the passions of the Australian people, who are legitimately concerned about the arrivals on our border. But let us make no mistake: with this policy of theirs—frustrating the parliament and the government and trying to squeeze every vote out of this situation for themselves to try and change the government of Australia, instead of cooperating, ending this issue and saving lives—ultimately they have the tiger by the tail, and ultimately all of their dark partisanship will rebound on them and it will be to their everlasting disgrace.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">
                  <a href="220370" type="MemberSpeech">
                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Mrs GRIGGS</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Solomon</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">16:02</span>):  I rise to speak on this matter of public importance, the impact of the record number of people illegally entering Australia by boat under this government. The boats keep coming, and that is why again I have to speak about the Gillard Labor government's absolute failure to protect our nation by efficiently protecting our borders and our immigration program. It is clear to all that the Gillard Labor government has lost control of our borders, and the people smugglers are jumping for joy because they still have a product to sell and will do that at any cost.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Australians know that it is the Gillard Labor government that undid the border protection policies introduced by the Howard government. As I have said in this place before, it does not surprise me to hear very concerning reports that the people smugglers are racing to fill their boats before 14 September, and we all know why: because the Gillard Labor government has the welcome mat out and that will be laid out until then. With the election date fast approaching and with a possible change of government, the people smugglers are doing all they can to fill their boats as fast as they can. The Gillard Labor government is complicit in this because it removed the border protection policies that have been proven to work. The people smugglers know that the coalition will stop the boats.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We are seeing evidence that Labor's border protection failures continue day after day—so much so that the people smugglers are looking for any chink in the armour after the Gillard Labor government's cuts have left our hardworking border protection service overworked and understaffed for the increasing number of boat arrivals. What we can infer from the recent influx of boat arrivals approaching the Top End of Australia is that the recent people smuggler boats have been targeting the mainland of Australia in a bid to exploit the legal loophole that would exclude people from being sent offshore for processing. Let's all remember that it is the Gillard Labor government that has been messing around with this excision bill and failed to get it to pass through the Senate whilst it was too busy pushing through its media reform bills. The Gillard Labor government foolishly pursued its media reform bills instead of passing legislation to excise the mainland of Australia. This just meant that the people smugglers can continue to sell their product: to get to the Australian mainland so their clients can avoid being processed offshore.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Many people in my electorate tell me that they are tired of the Gillard Labor government wasting money when Darwin and Palmerston, like so many other jurisdictions across the country, are in desperate need of funding for improvements in health, education, community safety, housing and child care. After almost six years at its disposal, the Gillard Labor government has not stopped and will not stop the boats. It cannot. We are seeing record numbers of arrivals. The <span style="font-style:italic;">Northern Territory News</span> reported last week that the number of illegal arrivals by boat had hit 40,000. The <span style="font-style:italic;">Northern Territory</span><span style="font-style:italic;"> News</span> also reported the disgusting conditions people smugglers are inflicting on their clients.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">So let's just look at how many arrivals have been intercepted off the shores of Darwin this year alone. On 1 January HMAS <span style="font-style:italic;">Armidale</span> intercepted a boat west of Darwin carrying 43 people. On 28 February HMAS <span style="font-style:italic;">Launceston</span> intercepted a boat north-north-west of Darwin carrying 33 people.

On 21 April HMAS <span style="font-style:italic;">Maryborough</span> intercepted a boat north-west of Darwin carrying 67 people. On 23 April, ACV <span style="font-style:italic;">Ocean Protector</span> intercepted a boat north-north-east of Darwin carrying 65 people. On 26 April, HMAS <span style="font-style:italic;">Maitland</span> intercepted a boat west-north-west of Darwin carrying 75 people. On 3 May, HMAS <span style="font-style:italic;">Albany </span>intercepted a boat west-north-west of Darwin carrying 160 people. On 4 May, ACV <span style="font-style:italic;">Botany Bay </span>and<span style="font-style:italic;"></span>MV OMS <span style="font-style:italic;">Endurance </span>intercepted a boat north-west of Darwin carrying 105 people. That is 13 boats targeted for Darwin, carrying 1,006 people. Clearly, there is a new approach for the people smugglers and they are targeting the Top End. That is over 1,000 extra people putting pressure on our services in the Top End, where our services are already under pressure and completely thin on the ground.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Let's just look at the track record for all of the arrivals. Two hundred and eighty-eight boats and 18,255 people have arrived in Australia since August 14 last year. This was when the Gillard Labor government agreed to open Nauru as an offshore processing centre. This was their big deterrent. Clearly that has not worked either. Since the last federal election there have been 673 boats and 40,772 people that have arrived illegally on our shores. What a great track record—they should be so proud!</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Let's look at the cost. It is over $5 billion. As I have said in this place before, I can only imagine what I could do in Solomon with $5 billion. $5 billion would go a long way towards the NDIS too, wouldn't it? But clearly we have spent it on different things. Five billion dollars would be able to fund a desperately needed hospital in Palmerston. It would be able to fund new police to improve community safety, perhaps a new school for our ever-increasing population, affordable housing for the Territorians who are being forced into homelessness every day due to the housing crisis, improvements to our roads to combat the ever-increasing traffic due to our population growth. No wonder the people of my electorate are fed up with the Gillard Labor government and its failed border protection policies—policies that give the people smugglers a product to sell.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">People in my electorate know very well that every dollar spent on combating people smugglers is a dollar not spent in our community. Darwin has become the Gillard Labor government's front line failure for border protection policies. Our detention centres are full. The Prime Minister was in Darwin last weekend when 18 detainees escaped from our detention centre. She knows first-hand how she and her border protection policies have failed, and have impacted significantly on my electorate, because the boats continue to arrive to the point where families and children are now being transferred to detention centres that were previously used for males. After the Gillard Labor government promised children would be removed from formal detention and removed from being behind barbed wire, they are now being relocated to a site previously only suitable for males in detention. Another Labor broken promise.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">There is a different way. The coalition does have a plan, an alternative to mitigate the disastrous impact that the Gillard Labor government has had on border protection. We have stopped the boats before and we will do it again. The coalition will restore what the Labor Party abandoned: a strong border protection regime developed by the coalition as a priority to protect our nation's borders.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The coalition will reintroduce off-shore processing of illegal boat arrivals as part of a series of measures to stop the boats and protect our borders. We will prevent this problem by minimising the numbers coming from both initial countries of origin and first asylum countries. We will disrupt the business of people smuggling and intercept the boats where it is safe to do so. We will make it a priority to identify and assist those in genuine need of refugee protection as early as possible. We have done it before and we will do it again.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The Howard government successfully reduced the flood of illegal arrivals to a mere trickle. Between 2002 and 2007, 10 illegal entry boats arrived with fewer than 250 passengers. Compare this with over 400 boats and 25,000 people arriving illegally since the last federal election. It is fair to say Labor's management of this issue has been a disaster. The boats must be stopped. There is no argument that people smuggling is a good result for anyone. It is unsafe for asylum seekers and every year people die from taking this risk. Stopping the boats is a priority in my electorate, and given the opportunity, the coalition has made it a priority to fix this disaster and the legacy of the Gillard-led Labor government. <span style="font-style:italic;">(</span><span style="font-style:italic;">T</span><span style="font-style:italic;">ime expired)</span></span>

                  </a>  Thank you, Mr Deputy Speaker. We have heard a range of speakers on this topic, and some interesting ideas from both sides. I will take out the member for Solomon's contribution, because that was just a stitching-together of election slogans. But there were some interesting ideas put forward in this MPI, because it is an important issue.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The world has changed significantly since the Howard government came to power in 1996, and significantly since those years in 1999, 2000 and 2001 when a significant number of boats started heading towards Australia. Let's look at things that have happened. Australia's population has obviously increased—we have now reached 23 million people, and I think that the world's population has reached nine billion. Climate change is recognised by all—leaving aside a few people on the opposite side of the chamber—of the world's serious scientists as being a significant problem. Now, today, there are approximately 46 million displaced people within their own countries—46 million people displaced around the world—and we see it playing out in war in horrible places like Syria; with climate change impacting on many countries both in terms of agricultural production or rising sea levels; and also with some political challenges that have come. Over 15 million people have registered with the United Nations High Commission for Refugees and they are seen to have a legitimate case.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Australia has a proud history of accepting immigrants. We are a nation of immigrants, as you know by looking around at the surnames, religions and backgrounds of people in this chamber. Since the end of World War II, almost six million people have migrated to Australia from other nations. So we do understand migration. We are not a xenophobic nation, even though ever since 1788 we have had an almost pathological fear as a nation of people coming in boats. Whether we are worried about the French that were only a couple of days late, the Russians, the Japanese, the Germans, the Vietnamese or whoever, it seems to be part of Australia's DNA to have a fear of boats, but also to welcome the person from overseas who lives next door to you, even though they seem to be contradictory concepts. In my electorate about one in three people were born overseas, but throughout Australia it is about one in four. I think we are No. 2 in the world in terms of taking refugees in—I think we went past Canada the other day—and it is basically the United States, Australia, Canada and then a fair bit of daylight before you get to anyone that takes any significant numbers. I think some of those Scandinavian countries take 100 or 200 and then it is basically no-one else. You can count the number of countries that do accept refugees on two hands. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">In stripping out some of the politics and passion about this topic, it is important to remember that approximately 90 per cent of the asylum seekers who arrived by boat were found to be refugees. It does vary from year to year depending on where the people are coming from, and I think the minister indicated that there had certainly been a change in terms of people coming from Sri Lanka. In terms of people arriving by plane, where there is nowhere near the hysteria, less than 50 per cent of those seeking asylum have been found to have genuine cases. We need to put that in that context. It is a horrible fact that if people are coming because they are starving to death that is not a genuine claim to be a refugee. If you are coming because your island is being covered by waves and you are drowning, you do not have a genuine claim as a refugee. It is a horrible fact that some people do not realise that you must be fleeing extreme persecution on the grounds of race, religion, nationality or the membership of a particular social group or political opinion. I have certainly got refugees in my electorate that have come both by boat and by plane who have those characteristics—and I particularly mention many of the Vietnamese in my suburb of Oxley who made that journey and many of the Sudanese in my suburbs of Moorooka and Annerley as well as Hazari throughout my electorate who came for all sorts of different reasons.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">That is one of those facts that we do not realise, that we could watch someone starve to death and that will not enliven our treaty obligations given the treaty that we on both sides of the chamber support. I particularly thank the member for Wakefield for touching on that history of bipartisanship in this area—a proud history of bipartisanship in this area—where people did not play the race card. Instead, they played the national interest card: the right thing to do, the Christian thing to do, the 'what would a good neighbour do? thing' That has been the case in the past where we see those figures for the Vietnamese. I had not realised that the actual number of Vietnamese people arriving was so low in terms of those coming by boat—1,700 people throughout the late seventies—but the number of Vietnamese who then came under other programs is obviously much more significant and they continue, as a whole, to make a great contribution to our economy and to our nation.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">What to do to set up a situation where we manage this flow, this reality of a changed world? We cannot just put the mirror up and say, 'This is what we did in 2001-02.' As we heard from the minister, that policy was of a time and was flawed at that time. We must accept the advice of the people who know, and that is the Navy, the people who actually go out there on the waves and put their lives at risk. They have said very clearly that it is too dangerous and that we put ADF lives at risk. I have stood in this chamber too many times commemorating the loss of ADF personnel lives, and to think that a political decision could result in more ADF personnel dying scares me horribly. Along with the member for Stirling, who spoke earlier, and the member for Wakefield, I was a part of the joint select committee chaired by Senator Gavin Marshall that looked into the Christmas Island tragedy. We stood on the cliffs at Christmas Island and many of you have seen the footage of that boat breaking up there, except we then had to watch the entire footage and see those young girls drowning—the footage that did not make it onto our news at night. That event was significant because we had the footage, but there are so many other untold stories of lives lost at sea. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Every day that I go for a walk in Canberra I walk through the SIEV X memorial to those 300 other lives that were lost. We need to do all we can as a nation to stop people making that journey in boats, because the reality is that about one in 20 of them will drown. Lots of things motivate people to get into boats, but the reality is that it is about a one in 20 ratio of people drowning at sea. That is why we asked Angus Houston, the former chief of our Defence Force and very well respected by both sides of the chamber, to pull an expert panel together and find out what we should do. All of their recommendations must be in place for the whole suite of measures for us to be able to stop people making those dangerous journeys.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">However all of them were supported, apart from the politics that came into play in the Malaysian solution, where we had that dreadful hypocrisy of, 'We will tow boats back to Indonesia, even though they are not a signatory to the UNHCR treaty,' and at the very same time saying, 'We won't send people to Malaysia because they are not a signatory to the UNHCR treaty'. It is that rank hypocrisy from those opposite, where they are prepared to milk this situation for every available vote.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">
                  <a href="230485" type="MemberSpeech">
                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Mr CHRISTENSEN</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Dawson</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">16:22</span>):  I rise to speak on this matter of public importance: the impact of the record numbers of people illegally entering Australia by boat under this government. No other issue that faces the Australian people today better illustrates the outcomes of the chaotic, divided and dysfunctional government. What better manifestation of an incompetent government could there actually be than the deliberate removal of policy walls that were protecting our home and our nation, just as we have seen under these Labor Rudd and Gillard governments? Perhaps tonight's budget might actually be a better manifestation, but let us not forget the impact that losing control of our borders is going to have on tonight's budget, and all the budgets. More than $5 billion of border protection blow-outs have occurred since the last election, and all that has contributed to the substantial black hole that the Treasurer will preside over tonight.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The blow-outs result from Labor's remarkable ability to spot something that has been solved—something that is fixed—and turn it into a problem, and then quickly turn it into a crisis. Having watched the former Prime Minister, John Howard, effectively stop the flow of illegal boat arrivals, this Labor government proceeded to dismantle the solution and create a problem. It has turned into a crisis, and the boats keep coming and coming and coming.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Since November 2007, when the successful Howard government ended, we have seen a staggering 40,772 illegal arrivals in our country. The sheer scale of Labor's border protection failure now surpasses the population of most towns in my electorate of Dawson. The Labor Party must be wishing that those illegal arrivals could all vote, because they must have imported almost half an electorate in the past 5½ years.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">But I have to tell you that the other 150 real electorates around the nation are not so impressed. People have genuine concerns about their country throwing its doors open to economic refugees and throwing the immigration program over to people smugglers, human traffickers and perhaps terrorists. In this post-9/11 world we see airport security getting tighter and tighter, but in the post-Howard years we see Australia's maritime border security getting looser and looser. When this government sets new benchmarks for porous borders on a daily basis, Australians rightly question how many illegal arrivals are genuine refugees who will become tomorrow's citizens and how many are using the back door to become a threat to our nation.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Illegal immigration through people smuggling is a threat to all Australians. It is a threat because it raises serious security and criminal concerns, it raises quarantine and health issues, it costs time and money in processing and a lot of time and a lot of money under this government. Most importantly, it infringes on our nation's sovereignty and gives us less control over who comes into this country.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">These are not actually my claims: what I have paraphrased there is from the Australian Federal Police website. To rebut what was said by the previous speaker, the member for Moreton: arrival in illegal people-smuggling vessels is actually different, and more of an issue, from illegal arrival by plane. We know who you are when you get here by plane; you have to have identification to get on the plane. We probably know where you are from as well. When you arrive by boat, without identification, there is a serious issue in working out whether you are a security risk to this nation.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">While those on the opposite side would have us believe that all of these concerns are just unfounded, the facts actually speak for themselves. Last week on 7 May, <span style="font-style:italic;">Nine News</span> reported that four Vietnamese asylum seekers, including a teenage boy, were on the run after escaping from the Darwin detention centre. What about the public revelation in April that recent unauthorised arrivals included a Sri Lankan man who allegedly fled his home after killing his girlfriend, an Egyptian man who was the subject of a high-level Interpol red notice for terrorism activities and an Iranian man accused of drug trafficking in Teheran?</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">A month ago I noticed a report that asylum seekers who had actually been branded as national security threats were protesting and asking the government to release them from detention or kill them. The article where I read about this went on to say that most of the asylum seekers had been in detention for two or three years following adverse security assessments from ASIO. They were among 56 in Australia who have been deemed threats to national security, without the ability to challenge those decisions. But they have been deemed by our agency which looks after national security as national security threats.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">On 4 September last year the <span style="font-style:italic;">Australian</span> reported that asylum seekers with violent histories were being released on bridging visas or into community detention. One was even allowed to marry in detention and make home visits to his wife. The 31-year-old was considered by ASIO to be a risk to security. Again, on 16 August last year the <span style="font-style:italic;">Australian</span> reported that asylum seekers travelling to Australia had been identified by Sri Lankan authorities as members of the Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam. The identification of the terrorist group members was based on photographs of new arrivals published in the Australian media. Back in 2010, on 14 July, the <span style="font-style:italic;">Australian</span> reported that Indonesian authorities believed they had captured a senior Afghan al-Qaeda link figure posing as an asylum seeker and trying to reach Australia. There is this overwhelming body of evidence that Labor's open-doors policy is a real and direct threat to our national security and our way of life.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">We can look to the experience in Britain to see the impact of unfettered illegal immigration. In an op ed piece back in 2009, the foreign editor of the <span style="font-style:italic;">Australian</span>, Greg Sheridan, wrote about a discussion he had had with the then British Foreign Secretary, David Miliband. Miliband said to him that 75 per cent of all terrorist plots that were aimed at Britain actually originated in the federally administered tribal areas of Pakistan. He noted that some 800,000 Pakistanis lived in Britain. He said:</span>

                <span class="HPS-Small">The real historic significance of the illegal immigration crisis in our northern waters is that this could, if things go wrong, be the moment Australia loses control of our immigration program, and that would be a disaster.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">If we are importing potential security risks because we are too scared to be labelled racist, bigots, dog whistlers or whatever then we are condemning this nation to an inevitable terrorist attack. The real danger that we face is that most Australians are too scared to mention the elephant in the room and this Labor government is too gutless to acknowledge that the elephant they rolled out the red carpet for is a very dangerous thing to actually have in your room.</span>
              </p>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">Never one to wear the gutless tag, the former member for O'Connor, Wilson Tuckey, said, in 2009, he believed terrorists could be masquerading as asylum seekers. His reasoning was:</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">At the time, the member for Griffith, then Prime Minister, predictably condemned those comments, but the fact is that Wilson Tuckey was right. The facts speak for themselves.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">The Gillard Labor government, not content with having the worst border security crisis in the history of our nation because of their dismantling of policies that worked, are now trying to pull the rug out from our national security agencies. These are the agencies charged with the responsibility of ensuring those who arrive illegally on our shores do not pose a risk to our nation. This is what the Labor Party wants them to do. On 1 May, two weeks ago, Radio National reported that Labor backbenchers were pressuring the government on ASIO assessments. It said the federal government was considering calls by its own backbench for increased scrutiny of the way ASIO makes adverse assessments of asylum seekers. They are upset because those 55 alleged asylum speakers I spoke of before have no prospect of release in sight because they are deemed by a national security agency to be a threat to this nation. So, far from recognising the dangers of security threats to this country, the Labor Party wants to ignore what ASIO says and just let them in.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We ignore the advice of ASIO at our peril. I am reminded of a story printed in the <span style="font-style:italic;">Australian </span>on 4 September 2001, a week before the terrorist attacks on the World Trade Center. It reported that the US Assistant Secretary of State for East Asia and Pacific Affairs, James Kelly, said the flow of illegal immigrants from South Asia and the Middle East into Indonesia was a source of concern. He said:</span>

                <span class="HPS-Small">If it's easy to move people under strange identities around, that's a capability that terrorists who we know exist can then use.</span>

                  <a href="HWE" type="MemberSpeech">
                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Mr SIMPKINS</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Cowan</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">16:32</span>):  I thought that, given that the government has no more speakers on the MPI, I would stand and have my comments as well. We have heard a lot about what has happened in the six years since the last time the coalition was in government. The story is not good. The story is a tragedy for a lot of people who have lost their lives along the way. The story is a tragedy for the finances of this country: some $6 billion in overspending and waste this government has presided over when there was a working system which discouraged people from risking their lives, because they knew the chances of making it to Australia were very slim. The trickle of boats that took place from 2001, when the Howard government saw a problem and created a solution, became a flood when the current government, under the former Prime Minister and continued in every respect by the current Prime Minister, changed the system completely, encouraging people to come to this country, risking their lives and putting money into the pockets of people smugglers and other international criminals. That is a tragedy. This is what happens to this country when a government that does not understand the priorities and wisdom of strong borders is let loose.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Look at what actually took place. We hear a lot from those on the other side about compassion. We hear a lot from those on the other side about the circumstances of those who come to this country. No-one says that the people who come by boats are coming from a great place. The point is that this immigration system—even our humanitarian refugee program—must have integrity. Currently, all those who come by boats take the emphasis away from all those stuck in refugee camps around the world.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I have plenty of refugees in my electorate—plenty of people who have come from Africa, plenty of people who have come from Burma. There are a lot of places in the world where we need to do our best to support refugees and to give people a better life, but the fact that you have money should not matter; your need should matter. I have been to a refugee camp up on the Burma-Thailand border. I have been to a refugee camp and seen the faces of little children who are going to be stuck longer in those refugee camps because this government cannot do the job the Australian people are paying them to do. That is a damn tragedy. Why should the children in refugee camps in Thailand—those Karen and Chin children, those strongly persecuted minority groups—finish second? Why should they be delayed any day longer than they have to be because this government cannot get its priorities right? What about those who know their families are stuck in refugee camps back in Africa and are desperate to get their families out of those circumstances? Why are those people stuck in refugee camps in Africa with no chance of coming here? The answer is that this government has dropped the ball. They created the problem out of the solution that the Howard government had.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I hear this a lot in schools and from the government as well. They talk about the terrible circumstances of those who come by boat and why they want to come here. As I said before, no-one doubts that there are bad circumstances in other countries—in Afghanistan, in the Middle East. No-one doubts that these circumstances are unpleasant and desperate, but it remains a matter of priorities.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I was at a function last year—just upstairs in Parliament House—where there were a lot of refugee advocates. I heard some people questioning the coalition's knowledge of the refugee convention. Article 31 is the main part of the convention that a lot of us think about when we talk about those who come by boat. Article 31 talks about people coming directly. In case there is any doubt that I am trying to paraphrase this, article 31 of the refugee convention prohibits states and parties from imposing penalties on refugees who come:</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Small">… directly from a territory where their life or freedom was threatened … enter or are present in their territory without authorization, provided they present themselves without delay to the authorities and show good cause for their illegal entry or presence.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">This is often held up by some as the reason there should be no detention of those who come by boat, but the key part of article 31 is that it talks about people who come directly from a territory. I say to everyone here that, when you talk about directly from Afghanistan, there is a big difference between Afghanistan and Christmas Island or the Australian mainland or Ashmore Reef. You cannot hop on a boat in Kabul—or, in fact, anywhere in Afghanistan—and go to a different country. It is a landlocked country. So none of this 'directly' business comes into it. Those who come from Afghanistan do not move directly to Australia; they would have to go normally through Pakistan and, of course, as we know, hop on a plane. So they would go maybe from Karachi airport or maybe Islamabad airport—I am not sure—and probably then go to Malaysia or to Indonesia. So they wait in that departure lounge and then hop on a plane—maybe they get a meal or something like that—and then they land, maybe even in Jakarta. There is not a lot of directness in these circumstances. It really does bring into question how article 31 of the refugee convention comes into it. There is no moving directly from a territory where their life or freedom is threatened. That does not apply whatsoever. Of course, article 31 also talks about illegal entry.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I cast doubt on the legitimacy of many of those who come by boat to be considered as a refugee under article 31. Despite the fact that the circumstances in their old country are terrible circumstances—there is no doubt about it—it is not like they are coming directly from a threat and landing here. They go through other places where that threat does not apply and yet they still hop on a boat and take the places of those people that I spoke about before: those in refugee camps in Africa or in places like the Burma-Thailand border.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I say again, as I have said so many times in this place in numerous speeches: I might be accused of dog whistling or being a racist or something like that, but the reality is that what this government has done since 2008 when it changed the policies is take the emphasis away from those who are legitimately in need, those who are stuck behind barbed wire in refugee camps around the world, and, instead, give the opportunities through numerous places and through the support systems that they have here to those who come by boat. Under article 31 of the refugee convention I cast doubt on those who come by boat and I certainly cast doubt on their legitimacy to be received here under the humanitarian program in contrast to those who are stuck behind wire. This is an indictment of this government and in September the Australian people will get their chance to pass judgement.</span>

                  <a href="HWG" type="MemberSpeech">
                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Mr DREYFUS</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Isaacs</span>—<span class="HPS-MinisterialTitles">Attorney-General, Minister for Emergency Management, Minister for the Public Service and Integrity and Special Minister of State</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">16:43</span>):  by leave—I am pleased today to be able to table two very important reviews on Australia's counterterrorism legislation.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The first review I am tabling is the annual report of the Independent National Security Legislation Monitor for 2012. The monitor's role is created by legislation, to review Australia's national security laws and counterterrorism laws on an ongoing basis and determine whether they remain necessary, effective, proportionate and consistent with our international human rights obligations.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">In his 2012 report the monitor, Mr Bret Walker SC, examined the definition of a terrorist act, the control order provisions, the preventative detention order regime and ASIO's questioning and detention powers. I thank Mr Walker for the extensive work he has done in compiling this report.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The second review is the Council of Australian Governments review into counterterrorism legislation. In 2005, COAG considered the evolving security environment in the context of the terrorist assaults in London that year and agreed that there was a clear case for strengthening Australia's counterterrorism laws. The Commonwealth government and the states and territories then enacted legislation to better deter and prevent potential acts of terrorism and prosecute them if they occurred. The legislation included control orders, preventative detention orders and certain emergency stop, question and search powers held by police. COAG agreed that they would review the necessity and effectiveness of the new laws after a period of time.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The COAG review committee consisted of six members, including the chair, the Hon. Anthony Whealy QC, a retired judge from the New South Wales Court of Appeal, as well as two accountability members, two law enforcement members and a prosecutorial member. Two of those members were from Commonwealth agencies, the remaining four represented the states and territories. The COAG review committee made 47 recommendations. I thank the review committee, and especially the chair of the committee, the Hon. Anthony Whealy, for the hard work and time they have put into this review.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Both reviews are very thorough and thought provoking. There is some overlap of the provisions that the monitor and the COAG review committee reviewed. However, the monitor only reviewed Commonwealth legislation whereas the COAG review committee reviewed Commonwealth as well as complementary state and territory legislation. With two such detailed reports from two different review processes it is inevitable that there will be differences of perspectives and indeed that is a value of having the two separate processes. These reviews enable governments to better assess the different options available to serve the Australian people. The government values both these reports and serious consideration will be given to them. Given the overlap in recommendations of the reports, the government will be considering both reports together, after consulting with the states and territories.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">These reviews were both undertaken as part of the government's commitment to protect Australia, its people and its interests, while instilling confidence that our national security and counterterrorism laws will be administered in a just and accountable way. While these matters are not easily resolved, the matter foremost in my mind is ensuring the security and the freedom of the Australian people. In light of the recent terror attack in Boston, it is clear that it is as important now as it ever was to maintain strong capabilities in the fight against terrorism. Our counterterrorism framework has held us in good stead so far, but we cannot afford to stop being vigilant.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Both reviews will be available online later this afternoon. Mr Deputy Speaker, I present the COAG <span style="font-style:italic;">Review of </span><span style="font-style:italic;">c</span><span style="font-style:italic;">ounter-</span><span style="font-style:italic;">t</span><span style="font-style:italic;">errorism</span><span style="font-style:italic;"> l</span><span style="font-style:italic;">egislation</span> and the annual report of the Independent National Security Legislation Monitor and a copy of my ministerial statement. I ask leave of the House to move a motion to enable the member for Stirling to speak for four minutes.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">
                  <a href="E0J" type="MemberSpeech">
                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Mr KEENAN</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Stirling</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">16:48</span>):  I rise to welcome the Attorney-General's tabling of the annual report of the Independent National Security Legislation Monitor and the Council of Australian Governments <span style="font-style:italic;">Review of </span><span style="font-style:italic;">c</span><span style="font-style:italic;">ounter-terrorism legislation</span>. The coalition looks forward to giving careful consideration to these two documents. The suite of federal, state and territory laws that comprise our counterterrorism regime were controversial at the time when they were introduced and, mercifully, there have only been a few instances in which they have needed to be invoked, at least to their full extent. However, it cannot be denied that the threat of terrorism persists.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I endorse the Attorney-General's observation that, in light of the recent terror attack in Boston, it is clear that the maintenance of our counterterrorism capabilities is as important as it ever was and that, as the Attorney-General also observed, in keeping with our own traditions and way of life, the maintenance of these capabilities must be done in a just and accountable way. That is why in 2005, when the national suite of legislation was enacted by agreement amongst the Commonwealth, the states and the territories, the relevant governments agreed at COAG that the necessity and effectiveness of the laws should be subject to a coordinated review.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The annual report of the independent monitor is particularly welcomed by the coalition. The monitor was established only after a concerted effort on the part of the coalition back when the Rudd government was still young. A bill for the establishment of an independent monitor was introduced by the then member for Kooyong, Petro Georgiou, in early 2008. Mr Georgiou was immediately gagged by the Leader of the House, the member for Grayndler. In the other place an identical bill was introduced, by the then Liberal senator for Victoria Senator Judith Troeth, where it passed despite being opposed by the government. However, the government prevented it from proceeding beyond its first reading in this place. The government finally introduced its own flawed legislation, which only passed the parliament in 2010 after extensive amendment to ensure the monitor's independence. The coalition therefore derives considerable satisfaction from the tabling of the monitor's annual report.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The principle behind the establishment of the independent monitor and the COAG review is the protective principle. It is to add to the armoury of parliamentary surveillance another mechanism designed to ensure that the counterterrorism laws, which were amended so as to expand the executive and policing powers of the state in extraordinary times by introducing into our laws extraordinary measures, are not allowed to become ordinary measures by the passing of time. The government and the parliament were of the view that some traditional protections should be reviewed and the policing functions of the state should be extended through devices such as preventative detention and control orders, which were very controversial at the time, in service of the fundamental obligation of governments and parliaments—that is, to protect the public interest. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Those of us who remember those debates also remember that the government that introduced them, the Howard government, made it clear that these were extraordinary measures. It is to be hoped that the time comes when these laws are no longer necessary. However, it is clear, as the Attorney-General did observe, that that time is not yet. In the meantime it is appropriate that all Australian governments remain vigilant as to the appropriate use of these laws, and that is why the coalition welcomes the statement here today.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">

                    <span class="HPS-MemberContinuation">Mr OAKESHOTT:</span>
                  </a>
                  <span class="HPS-MemberContinuation" style="font-weight:bold;">
                  </span>As the committee responsible for oversight of the Parliamentary Budget Office and the Australian National Audit Office, the Joint Committee of Public Accounts and Audit is required by legislation to consider the draft budget estimates for each office with the chair making recommendations to both houses of parliament. Therefore, on budget day each year the committee makes a statement on whether, in its opinion, these offices have been given sufficient funding to carry out their respective mandates of oversight.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">In support of this process, both the PBO and the ANAO are empowered through their legislation to disclose to us, as a committee, their draft budget estimates, which the committee then considers in making any representations to government and the two houses. In layman's terms, this is the budget speech for those that are interested in the oversight bodies and their scrutiny powers.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Firstly, the new and welcomed Parliamentary Budget Office: in accordance with the Parliamentary Service Act, the committee received a copy of the PBO's draft budget estimates and met with the Parliamentary Budget Officer in March to review the office's position. The committee has subsequently received an update from the Parliamentary Budget Officer identifying revisions to his estimates.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The Parliamentary Budget Office has had a small level of additional savings allocated to it over the next two years. However, it did receive additional funding to increase its permanent staffing in response to a decision by government to extend the PBO's mandate.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The PBO's total revenue from government will be $10.752 million in 2013<span style="font-weight:bold;">-</span>14. The Parliamentary Budget Officer has given assurances to the committee that overall the budget approved for 2013<span style="font-weight:bold;">-</span>14 provides the necessary funding for the PBO to operate effectively and meet its legislated mandate. On this basis, the bipartisan Public Accounts and Audit Committee endorses the proposed budget for the Parliamentary Budget Office in 2013<span style="font-weight:bold;">-</span>14.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Secondly, the Australian National Audit Office: in accordance with the Public Accounts and Audit Committee Act and the Auditor-General Act, the committee received a copy of the Australian National Audit Office draft budget estimates and met with the Auditor-General in February to review these estimates. The committee has subsequently received updates from the Auditor-General identifying revisions to his estimates.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The Auditor-General's funding proposals were made in the context of considerable cost pressures. To place the Audit Office on a more sustainable footing, the Auditor-General advised the committee that he had sought modest supplementation in the 2013<span style="font-weight:bold;">-</span>14 budget: firstly, to fund the auditing of financial statements for newly created government entities, which is a statutory requirement of the Auditor-General; and secondly, to fund the continuation of a pilot audit of agency key performance indicators using powers given to the Auditor-General in 2011 following a recommendation by the Public Accounts and Audit Committee.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">In response, the committee has been advised that in today's budget: (1) the Audit Office will be receiving some $0.7 million to cover additional financial statement workload in 2013<span style="font-weight:bold;">-</span>14 and no additional funding has been provided for the forward years, but the Audit Office has been requested to develop a longer term funding arrangement for consideration by government; (2) the Audit Office has not received the requested supplementation for its KPI initiatives—however, it has been given the opportunity to bring back the proposal in the 2014<span style="font-weight:bold;">-</span>15 budget process; and (3) finally, targeted savings measures will result in a reduction to the Audit Office's annual appropriation over the forward years.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The Audit Office's total revenue from government is $74.965 million in 2013<span style="font-weight:bold;">-</span>14. The Auditor-General has advised that while this appropriation is not as much as was requested, with the help of prior surpluses, it is sufficient for him to discharge his statutory obligations and his work program for the year ahead. On this basis, the committee endorses the proposed budget for the Audit Office in 2013<span style="font-weight:bold;">-</span>14 and recommends its passage.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">However, the committee is strongly concerned about the level of funding uncertainty for the forward years. As it stands, the Auditor-General has indicated that the Audit Office will need to reduce its work program in the forward years unless new funding is provided in next year's budget.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The Audit Office is unable to reduce its financial statement audit work because of its mandatory nature and the need to adhere to professional standards. Proportional funding increases need to be provided as new entities are created. It is highly unusual that in this budget no funding has been set aside for the audit of new entities in the out<span style="font-weight:bold;">-</span>years. This sets a concerning precedent for future budgets.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The committee notes the government's request for the Auditor-General to develop options for longer term funding arrangements for new agency financial audits, and strongly encourages the results of this work to be seriously considered by government.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The committee will also closely monitor funding provided to implement a full audit work program for key performance indicators in the 2014<span style="font-weight:bold;">-</span>15 budget, informed by the outcomes of the current pilot project. The Audit Office has indicated that a broader KPI audit framework will not be able to be funded from its existing resource base.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The bipartisan Public Accounts and Audit Committee therefore recommends that steps be taken in next year's budget to place the Audit Office on a more financially sustainable footing to ensure that its essential work in scrutinising government processes and expenditure is properly resourced.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">In conclusion, the committee is concerned about the increasing pressures being placed on both the PBO and the ANAO. Both agencies only received partial funding for their extended mandates. On top of this, additional savings measures have been applied that further reduce the available funding. As independent authorities, both the PBO and the ANAO need to be sufficiently funded to fulfil their legislative requirements and adequately support the work of this parliament. It is also incumbent on all members of this chamber, regardless of political persuasion, to support the independence of these statutory offices by ensuring that their work is not misrepresented in public forums.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The committee appreciates the efforts of both the Parliamentary Budget Officer and the Auditor-General in maintaining strong working relationships across the parliament and particularly with the Public Accounts and Audit Committee. They have made themselves available for regular briefings and have been responsive to requests for information on a variety of topics. The committee looks forward to continuing these productive relationships. I present a copy of my statement on behalf of the Joint Committee of Public Accounts and Audit.</span>

                      <span class="HPS-MemberContinuation">Ms OWENS:</span>
                    </a>  by leave—The committee supports the passage of the Tax and Superannuation Laws Amendment (2013 Measures No. 2) Bill 2013 which makes important and beneficial taxation and superannuation changes. The committee also recommends that the Treasury undertake further consultation with industry groups on an aspect of schedule 5 of the bill.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">There are eight schedules in the bill. The committee did not receive any submissions on schedules 2, 3, 4, 7 and 8. The report focuses on issues raised in the other schedules—1, 5 and 6. Schedule 1 defines a 'documentary' for the purpose of accessing film tax offsets and makes explicit that game shows are not eligible programs. Currently, there is no definition of a documentary in the Income Tax Assessment Act 1997. The definition of 'documentary' to be inserted is based on the Australian Communications and Media Authority Guidelines, as was used by Screen Australia prior to the <span style="font-style:italic;">Lush House</span> case. In the committee's view, it is a reasonable response by the Australian government to reinstate the definition that Screen Australia had previously used in administering the producer offset. The committee noted industry stakeholder concerns that the definition lacks flexibility. The committee believes there is a need for ongoing dialogue between Screen Australia and the industry to ensure that the application of the definition in schedule 1 remains responsive to the evolving documentary genre.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Schedule 2 exempts from income tax the ex-gratia payment made to people affected by natural disasters in Australia during June 2011-12 and 2012-13. It is warranted to extend these disaster assistance plan payments and their tax exempt status to New Zealand citizens holding non-protected special category visas who were affected by these disasters.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Schedule 3 enables eligible businesses to continue to pay GST instalments if they subsequently move into a net refund position. It will allow businesses to continue to make their business activity statements annually and retain the cost advantage of not having to submit a quarterly statement. Entities that are not paying GST by instalments and are already in a net refund position remain ineligible to use the instalment option.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Schedule 4 adds six entities to the list of deductible gift recipients, making donations to these organisations tax deductible. Schedule 5 will provide a legislative basis for identifying and merging multiple superannuation accounts within the same fund. Many super funds are already performing these mergers. Groups who participated in the inquiry supported the intent of schedule 5 to reduce the amount affected members pay in multiple sets of administration fees and insurance premiums and consequently increase retirement savings.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">However, some industry groups expressed concern that the wording of the proposed subsection 108A(1)(c) could place undue liability on trustees by obligating them to examine each individual member's best interests rather than on a general trust fiduciary law basis, which is understood as acting in the collective best interests of members. The committee's view is that schedule 5 is making an important change to help super members maximise their retirement savings but recommends further Treasury consultation with industry groups to ensure that undue liability is not being inadvertently placed on trustees who are working in good faith for the benefit of their members. The committee also urges the Australian Prudential Regulation Authority to provide funds with guidance on circumstances which should trigger individual consideration of what constitutes a member's 'best interests'. Where funds are dealing with complex cases, the committee believes trustees should seek input from the affected members.</span>

                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">
                    <a href="00AN0" type="MemberSpeech">
                      <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Mr CIOBO</span>
                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Moncrieff</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">17:06</span>):  by leave—I will be brief. In terms of additional comments to the committee report, coalition members of the committee raised some concerns we had with respect to two schedules of the bill. In broad brushstrokes—and with emphasis on the word 'broad'—coalition members would agree with a number of the assertions made by the committee chair but, specifically with respect to schedule 1, coalition members felt it necessary to highlight that it was very clear there had been for all intents and purposes no consultation with industry with respect to the proposed changes as outlined in this schedule 1. Whether it was SPAA, the Screen Producers Association of Australia, or others that appeared on the day, it was clear that the first they really knew about it, the first opportunity that industry had with respect to the proposed changes, was when the draft bill itself had been put into the public domain. It would appear they took the view that it was, for all intents and purposes, a foregone conclusion. Coalition members highlight the fact that this is hardly the way to conduct good public policy and on that basis made some comments in our additional comments. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Schedule 6 is the super co-contributions. The reality is—and coalition members believe Australians recognise this but we want to highlight the fact—that the Gillard Labor government is again seeking to cut government super co-contribution benefits for low-income earners. As much as the Labor Party like to make out that they are a friend of low-income earners, the simple reality is that there have been so many changes on so many occasions that now it is clear that they are far from being a friend.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">After promising not to make any changes to superannuation in the lead-up to the 2007 election there have been, in fact, numerous changes invariably designed to undermine incentives for people to voluntarily save more toward their retirement. As well as reducing the concessional contribution caps, the government has cut super co-contribution benefits for low-income earners and imposed additional taxes of more than $8 billion on people's retirement. They have reduced concessional contribution caps from $50,000 and $100,000 per year, depending on your age, under the previous coalition government down to $25,000 per year across the board—a substantial reduction. This means anyone wanting to save more super per year than that low threshold has to pay the top marginal tax rate. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Targeting low-income earners saving for their retirement, Labor has also already reduced super co-contribution benefits for low-income earners from a maximum of $1,500 down to $1,000, while also reducing the matching rate from 1.5 down to one to one. This legislation proposes to cut the maximum super co-contribution benefit for low-income earners again, this time in half, down to just $500,with a similarly reduced matching rate halved from one to one down to 0.5 to one. Overall, the Labor government has cut super co-contribution benefits for low-income earners by more than $3.3 billion by far. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">In summary, coalition members want to highlight and make very quickly on the record that this is not a government that is committed to low-income earners, despite all the rhetoric to the contrary. The simple and inescapable conclusion to reach is that, beyond the headlines, this legislation is going to make it tougher for low-income earners, not easier.</span>

                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">
                    <a href="SE4" type="MemberSpeech">
                      <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Mrs BRONWYN BISHOP</span>
                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Mackellar</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">17:10</span>):  This legislation purports to implement recommendations 3 and 11 of the House of Representatives Standing Committee on Legal and Constitutional Affairs in its report, <span style="font-style:italic;">A time for change: yes/no?</span> of 2009. An expert panel was established to look at the question of change for local government recognition, and the final report came down in 2011. We are now looking at the Referendum (Machinery Provisions) Amendment Bill 2013, merely 124 sleeps away from the proposed date of the referendum and indeed the election.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">If you look back through the history of referenda in this country, you will find that very few have been held concurrently with an election—for the simple reason that, when you are dealing with the Constitution, it is felt that it is important that it be an issue in its own right and should not be confused, or confusing, for the electors as they vote on election day. Indeed, there should be a proper timeline to prepare for it, as the Electoral Commission stated in its own submission to the enquiry. They said that if it were truncated there were all sort of risks about the information not being given properly to Australian voters.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Recommendation 3 said that the yes/no pamphlet, which is an important part of any referendum, should be posted and received by every elector. The yes/no pamphlet has the yes case and the no case being put so that every elector can make their decision on proper information. It is required by the existing 1984 act, which, of course, was introduced by the Hawke government.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The coalition opposed this recommendation. The Standing Committee on Legal and Constitutional Affairs said that the pamphlet should be sent to every household, not to every elector. I think it is important to point out that in this current government, throughout this term, the government and the Special Minister of State has introduced several pieces of legislation that remove the term 'elector' and replace it with 'person'. This seems to be the next step in the government's desire to remove 'elector' from all relevant legislation. From this side of the House, we believe that the 'elector' and constant reference to the 'elector' is pivotal in maintaining a proper sense of voting, be it at elections or on referendums.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I will be moving in the consideration in detail stage two amendments, one of which will be to remove the provisions of this bill contained in the schedule which indeed remove the need for the yes/no pamphlet to be posted, and I accentuate 'posted', to each elector. The bill substitutes the phrase, 'sent to each address'.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We are also concerned that the bill—again getting rid of the term 'posting' and substituting 'sending'—will allow the Electoral Commissioner to send information to an address that he considers appropriate. It is a strong belief of the coalition that the Electoral Commissioner should not be assessing what is, or is not, an appropriate address—particularly an email address, which, in his second reading speech, the minister stated was contemplated. Rather, the AEC should be concerned to meet the provisions of the existing act and focus on maintaining the integrity of the role.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">It is interesting to note that there is no official register of emails for electors. There is no data here in the census that shows how many people have email. If you look at the American experience, they have on average about 1.6 email addresses each. Moving away from the effectiveness of the pamphlet being posted to each elector, I and the coalition think it is a fundamental and important part of ensuring a referendum to change our Constitution, the fundamental document which allows Australia to be governed for the peace, welfare and good government of the people. We are concerned about the provision that is contained in the schedule that they should be permitted to send the pamphlet by email simply does not stack up in this current environment. It may in the future. I do not know that. But I do know right now that it does not.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We have vigorously opposed automatic enrolment and the use of government departments to provide the AEC with information to be used to automatically enrol people to the electoral roll. The coalition sees this as a further request by the AEC for information on electors above and beyond what has already been provided. Email addresses are a phenomenon of the last 10 years and were not highly used or relevant in the last referendum held in 1999. Currently there are no statistics collected on the number of electors who have email addresses but the census does reveal that 19.6 per cent of dwellings do not have internet access, let alone a preferred email address. In Australia, as I said, there is no data that shows how many people have an email address. Indications from the Parliamentary Library are that the figure in Australia of people having email addresses is likely to be higher than in America. People only have one fixed electoral address but they can have many email addresses.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The second amendment that I will be moving when we come to consideration in detail deals with that section of the Referendum (Machinery Provisions) Act 1984 which is section 11(4). This amending bill seeks to suspend the operation of section 11(4) for the period up until the end of election day. It is important to point out that this provision was placed in the legislation to curtail unnecessary expenditure—to put a cap on. It specifically says:</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">The Commonwealth shall not expend money in respect of the presentation of the argument in favour of, or the argument against, a proposed law except in relation to the preparation, printing and posting, in accordance with this section;</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">(aa) the preparation, by or on behalf of the Electoral Commission, of translations into other languages of material contained in those pamphlets;</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">(ab) the preparation, by or on behalf of the Electoral Commission, of presentations of material contained in those pamphlets in forms suitable for the visually impaired;</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">(ac) the distribution or publication, by or on behalf of the Electoral Commission, of those pamphlets, translations or presentations (including publication of the internet);</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">(b) the provision of the Electoral Commission of other information relating to, or relating to the effect of, the proposed law; or</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">(c) the salaries and allowances of members of the Parliament, of members of the staff of members of the Parliament or of persons who are appointed or engaged under the <span style="font-style:italic;">Public Service Act 1999</span>.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Specifically, if that clause were to be suspended from operation, as this bill wishes it to do, it would leave it open to the government to spend as much money as it liked promoting one case or the other. The Standing Committee on Legal and Constitutional Affairs report of 2009 did recommend to ensure that spending is directed to referendum education and to equal promotion of the yes/no arguments. There is no provision in this enabling machinery legislation that requires any money spent by the government to be spent equally on the yes case and the no case which was clearly in the minds of the people who made the recommendation in the committee itself.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Further, the Spigelman report—which is the shorthand expression for the expert panel on constitutional recognition of local government—has pointed out that there is a need to ensure that the case for the proposed constitutional change is not left solely to politicians and the local government representative. It goes on to talk about, if it wishes to have it passed, having other people in the community who are convinced of the need for this to occur. Bear in mind we have 124 sleeps left until what Alan Jones likes to call 'clean-up Australia Day', the election day, and we are also to have this referendum on that day—obviously aimed to try and confuse the issue, I suspect. We are looking at the government wanting to have complete freedom to have a media campaign of one sort or another, probably in accordance with the existing regulations for advertising but it would be unfettered by this provision in the machinery legislation.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">It is also interesting to note that the Spigelman report found that, having commissioned research to be done about the support for a proposed referendum which has only just been announced, that fewer than 30 per cent of voters can be said to feel a sufficiently strong commitment at this time to the idea of recognising local government to provide high confidence they would support it at a referendum. So as we are at this late stage, where every indicator, including that of the AEC itself, is saying that a truncated period in which to prepare all of the information for a referendum would expose the referendum to risk of insufficient information being made available, I think it is eminently reasonable that we do not suspend that provision which puts a cap on the amount of money that can be spent because in this particular circumstance, where we have a budget coming in tonight that is going to show I think Labor's 20th deficit in a row and show that we are in a fiscally constrained period, it is economically irresponsible to be spending money outside of the provisions already contained in the Referendum (Machinery Provisions) Act to ensure that information is properly sent out to the electors of Australia to make up their minds one way or another. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">In concluding my remarks in this second reading debate, we will be moving two amendments in the consideration in detail stage. The first relates to the need to continue to send—that is, post—the yes/no case to every elector and the second amendment is to remove the provision that would suspend the provisions of section 11(4). In speaking in this second reading debate I have foreshadowed the amendments we will move because the coalition believes when you are looking at conducting a referendum to alter our Constitution that it is a critically important issue that the Australian people need to be well appraised of, that they need to be properly informed so they can make up their minds, that they should not be subject to expenditure which is not evenly divided between the yes and no cases, and that at a time when we are fiscally restrained it is really economically improper of the government to propose to spend additional money, which presumably they will have to borrow to spend, outside the provisions that are already satisfactorily provided for in the existing legislation.</span>

Last week the Prime Minister announced that the Australian government will hold a referendum on 14 September to ask Australians to financially recognise local government in our nation's Constitution. If agreed by the Australian people, the amendment will make a modest but important change to our Constitution so that the existing practice of federal government support for local communities is formally recognised in our Constitution. The change would formally recognise the reality of our three-sphere system of government in Australia. The Australian government works closely with local governments every day to deliver vital services to communities, and I expect the referendum proposal will receive broad and bipartisan support in this federal parliament and across the country.</span>

                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Making two small, sensible amendments the Referendum (Machinery Provisions) Amendment Bill 2013 helps to ensure that electors are able to make an informed vote in the referendum. These amendments will allow for stronger, more efficient communication with Australian electors. This bill implements the government response to two recommendations made by the then House of Representatives Standing Committee on Legal and Constitutional Affairs in its 2009 report <span style="font-style:italic;">A time for change: yes/no?</span> It is personally pleasing to be here today as the Attorney-General and Special Minister of State implementing recommendations from a House of Representatives Standing Committee on Legal and Constitutional Affairs report prepared at a time when I served as chair of the committee. </span>

                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">In the 2009 report the committee made several recommendations to amend the Referendum (Machinery Provisions) Act 1984. Under section 11 of this act the Australian Electoral Commissioner must arrange for arguments in favour of and against the referendum proposal to be printed in a pamphlet and posted to each elector. As the <span style="font-style:italic;">A time for change</span><span style="font-style:italic;">:</span><span style="font-style:italic;">yes/no?</span> report noted:</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Small">The printed pamphlet as the primary method of communication has been in place since 1912 and retains support from many within the community.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Recommendation 3 of the report was that, instead of posting the pamphlet to each elector, it be sent to each household. The amendments contained in this bill implement this recommendation but do so in a slightly different way than originally proposed. The amendments allow the Australian Electoral Commission to use the addresses they hold for Australian electors. Rather than attempting to describe what a 'household' is in the referendum act, it is more sensible to be able to draw on the existing database of addresses. Listening to the member for Mackellar's speech, it would appear that she has misunderstood the provision in the bill. I want to stress that email addresses are not provided for as an alternative to the use of postal addresses; they are an additional method of communication with electors that is proposed by this amendment. The whole intent of this amendment is to make sure that there will be as full communication as possible with Australian electors.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The bill also allows the Australian Electoral Commission to send pamphlets to any other address it considers appropriate, and I have mentioned the additional provision to allow pamphlets to be sent to an email address again if that is seen as appropriate. Many electors share residential addresses—for example, two adults who share a domestic partnership with, perhaps, adult children living at the same address. This amendment is aimed at making sure that the referendum pamphlet reaches Australian electors at least once, with less unnecessary and costly duplication. It is a provision which will save money.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The bill also implements recommendation 11 of the committee report, which was to lift the current limitation on spending imposed under section 11 of the Referendum (Machinery Provisions) Act. As many submitters to the <span style="font-style:italic;">A time for change </span>report pointed out:</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I would adopt the comments made by the member for Mackellar a moment ago about the need to ensure that electors are as informed as possible.

Lifting the limitation on spending is a sensible amendment which was also adopted in conjunction with the 1999 referendum—that is the last time that the Australian people were asked to vote on a change to our Constitution. The form of this provision in this bill to lift the limitation on spending is in exactly the same form as that used by the Howard government in 1999. I commend the bill to the House.</span>

In supporting the proposal that we should remain with simply the yes/no case being properly prepared and posted to each elector—which will be the subject of the second amendment proposing that it goes to electors and not to households—I refer to the fact that the Electoral Commission pointed out that, if there were not sufficient time for the preparation of additional material to be put together, the risks that would be invoked because of the short time frame between now and the holding of the referendum could include the following. I read from their submission dated 1 January 2013:</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">In other words, the Electoral Commission itself has said that that this short time frame that is now available for the preparation of material for a referendum on 14 September is going to pose risks as to whether or not it is seen by the Australian people to be properly conducted. This, of course, would only be compounded by the fact that not every elector is to receive a copy of the pamphlet individually.</span>

                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The Special Minister of State and the Attorney-General pointed out that in 1999, when we had a stand-alone referendum, this clause was suspended. But, of course, at that stage it was a stand-alone referendum, not one held concurrently with an election, and therefore the confusion element was not there. Secondly, it was at a time when we were having surpluses, the government was in good financial shape, the country was being well run and we were not in the parlous financial state that we presently are in. As I said earlier in my speech in the second reading debate, if the additional expenditure which the government wishes to make were to be allowed by suspending this clause, it would mean that we were being fiscally irresponsible in spending money that does not need to be spent and could be put towards some other good cause. So, when we are looking at the importance of not suspending this clause, I would say, firstly, that it is financially sound and, secondly, that it is heeding both the report of Mr Spigelman and the predictions of the Electoral Commission itself as to why, in this truncated time, it would be unwise to embark on additional expenditure which is outside the parameters of section 11(4).</span>

                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Isaacs</span>—<span class="HPS-MinisterialTitles">Attorney-General, Minister for Emergency Management, Minister for the Public Service and Integrity and Special Minister of State</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">17:37</span>):  Mr Deputy Speaker, the government opposes this amendment. This is a proposal by the opposition to retain a cap on spending that has been in the referendum (machinery provisions) legislation since 1912. That is where the member for Mackellar wants to take Australian electoral processes back to—1912.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The context is that this whole matter of what was to be the machinery provisions to apply to the next referendum to be held in our country was considered by the Legal and Constitutional Affairs Committee in a report in 2009, and we seem to have a change of heart by this opposition because the opposition members of that Legal and Constitutional Affairs Committee in 2009 supported the removal of the limitation on spending for the purposes of referendums. But, of course, this opposition, represented here by the member for Mackellar, is nothing but negativity and obstructionism. One can only say that what has just been said by the member for Mackellar borders on the bizarre. She has quoted from an AEC submission to the joint select committee into the holding of this referendum, and the particular passage from which she read refers to the risk of inadequate advertising material, in particular such matters as the risk that the advertising material in association with the referendum would not be culturally adequate, would not be culturally specific enough, and a range of other risks—all of them directed properly by the Australian Electoral Commission to its concern that the Australian electorate be as fully informed as possible.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">So what is the response put forward by the member for Mackellar? It is to propose that there should be no advertising; it is to propose that the only communication with Australian electors for the purposes of this referendum on recognising local government in our Constitution—bringing our Constitution a little bit alive and bringing it into the 21st century to recognise existing practice—is a yes/no pamphlet, a device that was invented in 1912, which is where the member for Mackellar wants to take us back to. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The removal of this cap on spending was supported by opposition members in 2009, and no explanation has been put forward by the member for Mackellar as to why it should not now be proceeded with. I would add that all parties, historically, have recognised that an effective referendum campaign—effective meaning that there is a high level of interest and a high rate of engagement by the voting public, not by the ultimate outcome of the vote, but effective in the sense of engagement—requires much more government input and financing than simply a yes/no pamphlet.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">In 1999, $4.5 million was spent on a public information kit for the referendum on the republic, and $15 million was divided between the two opposing committees—there was a yes committee and a no committee—and another $16.9 million was provided to the electoral commission for the yes/no pamphlet and related advertising costs. That is a total of $36.4 million spent by the Howard government in 1999 on that referendum. The Howard government, quite properly, recognised the need for a range of funding avenues. I just quote again from what the Legal and Constitutional Affairs Committee noted about this subject. They said:</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">The increased funding allocated to the 1999 referendum to provide for both educational material and further campaign advertising illustrates the significant difference between what is necessary for an effective referendum and what is provided for in the Machinery of Referendums Act… the Yes/No pamphlet alone is insufficient to educate and engage the public.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The reality is that starving this campaign of sensible, reasonable funding will mean that the Australian community is unaware of and disengaged from the information that they need to make an informed vote in September. It is shameful. This opposition when in government removed the cap on spending for the purposes of a referendum and explained in detail why it was necessary to do so, seemingly understanding then in government that simply sending out 2,000 words in the yes case and 2,000 words in no case in a pamphlet to Australian electors was not sufficient. This is what the then-Attorney-General, Daryl Williams, had to say on the removal of the cap:</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">In order to make an informed decision, the Australian people must have access to relevant information about our system of government and the proposal for change. The government believes that public funding should be made available to support a vigorous and engaging public presentation of the arguments for and against change.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This opposition does not want that; it does not want the Australian people to be informed. Fundamentally they are an antidemocratic opposition.<span style="font-style:italic;">(</span><span style="font-style:italic;">T</span><span style="font-style:italic;">ime expired)</span></span>

                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Mackellar</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">17:42</span>):  I think that it is important to make a couple of points. Firstly, the existing legislation was passed in 1984 by the Hawke government. There were referenda in 1984. That is a long way past 1912.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">It is important that people are properly informed, and that is why we are insisting that the pamphlet should be sent to each elector, not a household where it can simply be taken by one member of the household and disposed of and nobody else can even see it. It is important that it goes to each elector. I cannot stress enough how important it is—when we are talking about either the electoral roll for election purposes, or we are talking about conducting a referendum—that individual electors have to be the centre and main focus, not some grandiose plan that you can put information out there and hope that people will pick it up via advertising, squandering money at a time when we simply do not have any money.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The reason that I made a differential between what happened in 1999 and what is happening now is that then we had the money we could afford to spend. This time we do not have the money to spend. We have a government which is going to bring in another deficit here tonight, a deficit every year from Mr Swan in perhaps swan song. Indeed, if we are to be seen as fiscally responsible—as we wish to be—and live within our means, then you do not squander money on a campaign which is not necessary and at the same time deny the right of electors to receive directly information concerning that change.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We had a lot of fire and brimstone from the Attorney-General, and that is fine in firepower terms, but I do not think it is very convincing in terms of the need not to spend money unnecessarily, but to properly inform electors with the emphasis on electors as distinct from householders, and also to ensure that we do not go down the slippery slope of thinking that without properly connecting each individual elector you can have a proper referendum with people being properly informed. Point No. 1: if you want people to be informed, send the information to them directly and as an individual, not as a collective.</span>

                      <span class="HPS-MemberContinuation">Mr DREYFUS:</span>
                    </a>  On that basis, I will simply say that there is a complete hollowness in the member for Mackellar attempting to suggest that it is a desire to save money that is prompting this restriction of information to the Australian public about this practical and important change to our Constitution. I say again: the removal of the cap on the spending in association with referendums was accepted by opposition members in the deliberations of the House of Representatives Standing Committee on Legal and Constitutional Affairs back in 1999, and for good reason. You simply cannot say in the 21st century that this procedure is possible by use of a Yes/No pamphlet, a printed pamphlet, a procedure first devised in 1912. The member for Mackellar might point to the fact that the particular act of parliament that we are now seeking to amend was passed by this parliament in 1984, but the provision for the Yes/No pamphlet, which was taken up almost in identical words in the 1984 act of parliament, was first introduced to referendum procedures in 1912. We have not used the Yes/No pamphlet at every single referendum since 1912 for a range of reasons, but at most referendums it has been used. That procedure dates from 1912 and that is where the member for Mackellar would take us back to. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">There is something grossly inconsistent about the two amendments that are being put forward here by the member for Mackellar: on the one hand saying that the opposition do not want to spend any money in ensuring that there is appropriate information provided to Australian electors and, on the other hand, saying that they want to retain the wasteful expenditure of sending an individual package of the Yes/No pamphlet, even if there are five, 10 or 15 of these packages going to the same household. The Australian Electoral Commission has pointed to the wastefulness of that expenditure of an additional $4 million. We will save $4 million by not sending this Yes/No pamphlet to every single elector—and that is what the member for Mackellar wants to happen—but rather by sending it to addresses. There is a gross inconsistency in saying that, on the one hand, 'We don't want to spend any money,' and then in the next amendment, saying, 'We want to spend an additional, wasteful $4 million in order to send it to every elector, apparently on the basis that that provision has been there for a long time. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The purpose of lifting the cap is to make sure that appropriate means of communication are used. By that, I mean the use of the internet—which perhaps the member for Mackellar has now discovered—the use of television advertising, something that did not exist in 1912, or the use of radio advertising, which also did not exist in 1912. I assume that the member for Mackellar has got some awareness of these modern communication techniques. We are now in the 21st century and, because we are in the 21st century, there is a need to provide for proper communications techniques. I will quote again from what the committee had to say in its 2009 report:</span>

                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Mackellar</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">17:50</span>):  I think it is important to, again, point out that the date of the existing legislation is 1994, as passed by the Hawke government, and that there have been referendums since that time. It is also important to point out that the $4 million that the minister would like to save in postage is, presumably, money he would like to spend on promoting heaven only knows what. Although that committee proposed, back in 2009, that any additional expenditure be provided equally for the yes and no case, there is no provision for that in this amendment bill, just merely to suspend section 11(4). We believe that it is important—and, again, I stress this—that every individual elector receives the information, that they may individually be informed. The minister seems to be saying, 'No, that's not necessary. One pamphlet into any old household and then we will make up for it by having a full-on advertising campaign, paid for by the taxpayer, without any provision for it to be fair expenditure on a yes or no case.' </span>

                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I think that, when the Hawke government introduced this legislation back in 1984 and put a cap on expenditure, it was a sensible thing to do. In this time, when we are so stretched for cash, when we are so indebted as a nation, to waste money by spending like this is fiscally irresponsible. So I put forward a number of reasons as to why we should oppose the suspension of section 11(4). I think those reasons are compelling and I would commend those reasons to the House.</span>

                    </a>  It would mean that the yes-no case could be sent to households, as distinct from electors. As I said in my second reading speech, we believe that it is imperative that the concept of an elector is fundamental to the proper carrying out of an election and, indeed, of a referendum. So we believe that it is vitally important that this provision be removed so that we may return to the situation of the 1984 act, whereby every elector would receive the yes-no case. It would also prevent the Electoral Commissioner from making decisions about which address he may deem the fit one to send material to. As I pointed out in my second reading speech, with regard to emails, there is no available email register. There is no proper knowledge of which people have email addresses and which do not. At this stage, for 2013—it may be different in the future—we should maintain the position of posting, not sending, the yes-no case to every elector as an individual.</span>

                  </a>  The Minister for Broadband, Communications and the Digital Economy has provided the following answer to the honourable member's question:</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Small">I am aware that there have been calls from some in the Deaf community for access to emergency services to be available by Short Message Service (SMS). I understand that currently, people who are deaf, hearing and/or speech impaired who use text based communication can access emergency services via the National Relay Service (NRS) using a teletypewriter (TTY) to connect to 106, or using internet relay to connect to Triple Zero. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Small">On 8 February 2013, I issued a media release announcing that the Government had delivered an improved NRS, including mobile text-based access to emergency services for people who are deaf, hearing-impaired and/or speech-impaired. New contracts have been signed with existing providers Australian Communication Exchange and WestWood Spice to deliver a new and improved NRS from 1 July 2013. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Small">One of the new services to be implemented progressively in the second half of 2013 will be SMS Relay which will allow access to Triple Zero via text to the NRS for people who are deaf, or who are hearing-impaired and/or speech impaired. Some of the new services, including SMS Relay, require regulatory change and I have directed my department to immediately begin work on these changes and engage with the disability sector in their development. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Small">The new contracts have achieved the Government's objective of ensuring that existing NRS services are maintained, and that new services are introduced that enhance the NRS for the deaf, hearing-impaired and/or speech-impaired communities. </span>

                <span class="HPS-Small">(a) In March 2011, the Pharmaceutical Benefits Advisory Committee (PBAC) in recommending the listing of dabigatran (Pradaxa<span style="color:gray;">®</span>), advised the Government that, while dabigatran is a safe, efficacious and cost-effective therapy for 'at risk' patients with atrial fibrillation for the reduction of stroke and thromboembolism:</span>

                <span class="HPS-Small">The review found that awareness of atrial fibrillation should be increased, and that national guidelines and an education campaign for the detection and management of atrial fibrillation should be developed. Further, the review found that patients would benefit greatly if the use of existing therapies such as warfarin was better managed and supported.</span>

                    <span class="HPS-MemberAnswer">Mr Shorten:</span>
                  </a>  The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows:</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Small">
                  <span style="color:gray;" />
                  <span style="color:gray;">The business of all Disability Employment Services – Employment Support Service providers with a Star rating or 3 or below was subject to open tender. Progressive Employment Personnel received a 3 Star rating and was therefore invited to demonstrate its capacity through the tender. </span>
                </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Small">The outcomes of the DES tender process are the result of an independent purchasing process undertaken by the Department of Education, Employment Relations and Workplace Relations (the Department) under strict probity arrangements. In awarding tenders, the Department took into account each organisation's demonstrated understanding of disability employment services and the most effective ways to meet the needs of job seekers with disability; past performance; management, governance and value for money; local community links and partnerships; and strategies to meet the needs of local employers and job seekers. All decisions were subject to a 12-step checking process. Unfortunately, Progressive Employment Personnel Inc. Hornsby, was not successful in the tender process.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Small">As a result of the DES tender, job seekers with disability will benefit from a 50 per cent increase in the number of service sites across the country; bringing the total number of sites to more than 1650. In addition, new specialist providers and an increased number of mental health specialists will more closely meet the needs of the community. From March, job seekers have access to better services than ever before, through greater access to high performing employment service providers. On average, a job seeker moving from a 1 star to a 5 star provider will be more than twice as likely to get a job and around seven times as likely to have kept that job after 26 weeks.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Small">Australia ranks just 21 out of 29 OECD countries for employment participation for people with a disability. This is not good enough. Through record investment in supporting job seekers with disability, and by pursuing important reforms – such as uncapping services and conducting an open tender for DES –the Government is working to improve employment outcomes for Australians with disability. The decision to put DES to a competitive tender has been welcomed by disability advocates, including the Australian Federation of Disability Organisations and the National Council on Intellectual Disability.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Small">The Government is absolutely committed to improving services and opportunities for people with disability. In addition to the life-changing National Disability Insurance Scheme, we have made revolutionary changes to employment services for people with disability. We have removed the cruel caps on services that existed under the previous system, resulting in a 46 per cent increase in the number of people receiving services and a 100 per cent increase in the number of people securing jobs. In addition, we are investing a record $3.2 billion over 4 years on helping people with disability to secure work. The decision to conduct the first full competitive tender for DES was a continuation of the Government's commitment to improving services for people with disability.</span>

                  </a>  The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Small">The deeming rules are used to calculate income from financial investments for Social Security and Veterans' Affairs pension and allowance purposes. To calculate income, deeming rates are applied to the total market value of a customer's financial investments. That is, a rate of return is deemed to have been received and is assessed under the income test, rather than the actual income from the financial investment.</span>
              </p>

                <span class="HPS-Small">As the Minister for Families, Community Services and Indigenous Affairs, I have lead responsibility for deeming policy and monitoring of the deeming rates. The Minister for Employment and Workplace Relations and the Minister for Tertiary Education, Skills, Science and Research have the authority, under Section 1082 of the <span style="font-style:italic;">Social Security Act 1991</span>, to make a determination about the deeming rates that apply to payments that come within their portfolio responsibilities.</span>
              </p>

                <span class="HPS-Small">A wide range of investment indicators are analysed when reviewing the deeming rates. These include term deposit rates; cash management account returns; changes in share prices; share dividend yields; and managed investment returns. Where relevant, the term of investment and access to funds are also considered.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Small">Reserve Bank of Australia data, for example five-year government bond rates, and regular statements and reports on current and expected economic conditions, and the Treasury's analysis of money markets are also examined. Analysis tends to focus on the medium to long-term trends rather than short-term market fluctuations to minimise disruptions for pensioners by making multiple small changes.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Small">In reviewing the deeming rates and analysing this information, the type of financial investments generally held by pensioners is also taken into account.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Small">While there are no weightings applied to any of the indicators or factors, there is a set of principles that are considered when reviewing the deeming rates. These principles provide that deeming should be a simple and fair way to assess income from financial investments, so that pensioners with the same amount held in different financial assets receive a similar assessment; it should reduce the extent to which income support payments fluctuate; and it should simplify investment choice to encourage pensioners to choose investments on their merits.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Small">Given the complexity of the financial markets in relation to the above range of factors and the number of products and their varying terms and conditions, it is not appropriate to use a set formula when reviewing the deeming rates.</span>
              </p>

                <span class="HPS-Small">Deeming rates are kept under ongoing review and are set to reflect the returns available in the market to pensioners for their financial investments.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Small">This CENTROC study investigated a wide range of options for securing the water supply for the Central New South Wales (NSW) region. One of those options identified was a pipeline from Macquarie River to Orange to help secure the water supply for Orange. </span>

At each step, the sponsor is provided with information and recommendations from the sub-committees to allow consideration and response. This ensures that the PBAC considers all the relevant available evidence (not just that provided by the sponsor) before making a recommendation.</span>

The utilisation review was requested due to recent changes in diabetes management, including the Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme listing of a number of new anti-diabetic medicines. From this, a broader post market review, encompassing other aspects of diabetes management including self‑monitoring of blood glucose and continuous insulin infusion via insulin pumps was developed. This will ensure all aspects of diabetes management can be assessed in context.</span>

                  </a>  The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows:</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Small">(1) a) and b)</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Small">Quality use of medicines and health outcomes are inherently linked as better use of medicines leads to improved health outcomes.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Small">The Review of Anticoagulation Therapies in Atrial Fibrillation (AF Review) concluded that the net benefit of the new oral anticoagulation therapies in clinical practice, and the subsequent impact on cost-effectiveness, is uncertain at this stage and the Pharmaceutical Benefits Advisory Committee (PBAC) should review its March 2011 advice to list dabigatran (Pradaxa®) on the Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme (PBS). The PBAC reconsidered submissions from all sponsors of new oral anticoagulants at its March 2013 meeting. The outcomes of the March meeting were published on the PBS website on 26 April 2013.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Small">Aspen Australia has sent out information booklets to all Australian GPs entitled "Eating well with warfarin". The need for this was identified in recommendation 14 of the AF Review. The other recommendations in the AF Review are being investigated by the Department of Health and Ageing.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Small">The Statins Review and Post Market Review of Anti-Dementia Medicines used to treat Alzheimers Disease (Alzheimers Review) resulted in price reductions on PBS listed medicines, which will contribute to the sustainability of the PBS. This improves the health outcomes of Australians by enabling new medicines to be listed on the PBS for a wider variety of conditions, and by providing affordable access to medicines already listed on the PBS.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Small">The Alzheimers Review also resulted in changes to patient assessment required for continuation of PBS subsidised therapy. These changes enable clinicians and carers input to patient assessment which facilitates better identification of eligible patients and ensures access to these medicines is retained for those patients benefiting from treatment. The continuation rule has also been changed to a streamlined authority to reduce the administrative burden on clinicians. This will allow more time for clinicians, carers and patients to focus on optimising health outcomes. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Small">(2) PBAC recommendations arising from Reviews that are agreed by Government will be implemented within existing programs. For example, changes to PBS listings will be implemented through standard PBS processes, as has always been the case and the results of any changes to access to PBS medicines will be monitored through the Drug Utilisation Sub‑Committee of the PBAC. </span>

                <span class="HPS-Small">(1) (a) Price changes for Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme (PBS) subsidised medicines can occur on 1 April, 1 August or 1 December and requests to medicine sponsors to offer price cuts are aligned with these price change dates. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Small">The timeframes for price reductions to take effect are generally about 3 months. The Department of Health and Ageing consistently applies a response deadline of 2 weeks for sponsors to respond to requests on pricing matters including price reduction offers. Requests from medicine sponsors for extensions to this deadline are granted where possible taking into account individual circumstances.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Small">(b) The deadlines to apply a brand price premium or change a current premium are published on the PBS website in October to November of the preceding year, and are around 3 months before the premium change takes effect.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Small">(c) All changes to the PBS restriction of a medicine require the involvement of the Pharmaceutical Benefits Advisory Committee (PBAC). The timelines for the PBAC processes are on the Department's website.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Small">(2) Sponsors of PBS-subsidised medicines have on occasion challenged the adequacy of the timeframes to respond to requests for price reduction offers on their medicines. However such challenges are not universal. For example, sponsors of three of the four medicines included in the recent Alzheimer drugs review offered price reductions within the initial 2 week timeframe requested by the Government.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Small">(3) The majority of price reductions arise from PBAC recommendations. To date, price reductions have been requested before or in conjunction with restriction changes.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Small">(d) No. Price disclosure results in price changes that follow the average prices at which the affected medicines are actually being sold in the market. The price changes are therefore consistent with the commercial decisions already being made by pharmaceutical companies about the sustainable price for sale of the medicines. </span>
