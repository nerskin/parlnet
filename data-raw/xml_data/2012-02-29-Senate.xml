                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Queensland</span>â€”<span class="HPS-MinisterialTitles">Minister for Agriculture, Fisheries and Forestry and Minister Assisting on Queensland Floods Recovery</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">09:31</span>):  We are dealing with Greens amendments (20) and (21), which provide that mutual assistance should be refused in all cases involving the death penalty without exception. I have had a long association with this issue. This government and all governments in Australia have continued to remain very strong against the death penalty throughout. The government does not in this instance, though, support removing the discretion to provide assistance in death penalty cases. The existing death penalty ground for refusing mutual assistance is consistent with Australia's strong opposition to the death penalty while still affording sufficient flexibility to ensure that assistance can be provided to combat serious criminal activity, because special circumstances may exist where the foreign country provides an undertaking that the death penalty will not be imposed or, if imposed, it will not be carried out. So we can find the way through this by ensuring that we have mutual assistance with other countries while maintaining our strong voice in international fora about how Australia condemns those countries who use the death penalty.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Another example where mutual assistance for special circumstances may arise is where assistance provided would assist a defendant to prove their innocence. The way the legislation is structured is to ensure that fairness is at the heart of the system. The Mutual Assistance in Criminal Matters Act also enables conditions to be placed on the provision of assistance so that, in instances where there is a view taken by the government, we can place strong conditions on that. This could include, for instance, restricting the use of material to investigative purposes or requiring the country to seek the minister's authorisation to use material for the purposes of prosecuting a person. All of that means that the system that is in place will ensure that we continue to be strong advocates against the death penalty.</span>

                      <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Senator CAROL BROWN</span>
                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Tasmania</span>â€”<span class="HPS-MinisterialTitles">Deputy Government Whip in the Senate</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">09:36</span>):  As I rise to make a contribution to this debate I am very pleased to once again have an opportunity to put on record my support of the National Broadband Network. I am proud to be part of a government that recognises the importance of bringing Australia's broadband services into the 21st century. As we move towards a digital economy we need to remain competitive in our region, and this is why we are delivering the NBN. No matter what the location, the NBN will ensure high-speed broadband to everywhere in Australia. All homes, schools and businesses will be included.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Fibre-to-the-premises technology, with speeds of one gigabit per second, will connect 93 per cent of premises. Satellite and wireless technology will service the rest of Australia and provide faster and affordable broadband. To put it in layman's terms, what we are talking about is broadband speed a thousand times faster than the speed that many people currently receive. Rural and regional communities, such as my home state of Tasmania, have already started to benefit from the NBN and will continue to prosper and thrive with the assistance of high-speed broadband. The NBN is the single largest infrastructure investment made by an Australian government. It will deliver a once-in-a-generation improvement of our telecommunications infrastructure and it will benefit all Australians. It is cutting-edge technology that will transform our economy and create new ways of connecting with each other and the world.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">There have been Australian and international studies that have shown broadband to be one of the strongest ways to increase social and economic development. The Connecting Communities review by a global telecommunications solutions provider looked at the benefits of broadband in the United Kingdom and what this means for Australia. The findings were that high-speed broadband is directly related to strong regional areas and attracting and retaining employees, and also contributes to a low-carbon future. It can be summed up as being 'transformational for Australia'.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We know that, as a significant nation building project, the NBN will end up paying for itself. The advantages it will provide are incredibly widespread and touch on every facet of our lives, including health, education and business. At a grassroots level it will mean that local businesses can develop and get in touch with new markets and that people will be able to access health care without having to leave their homes.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I would like to share a story from my home state of Tasmania, which I know you will be interested in, Mr Deputy President, that highlights the benefits of the NBN. It involves a sign-writing business in Midway Point, which was one of the three towns in the initial rollout. Midway Point is in the electorate of Lyons and is represented by Dick Adams, who is a strong supporter of the NBN and a great advocate for his community. This business has seen an increase in its capacity to attract customers thanks to the NBN. As the broadband speed is faster and more reliable, large artwork files can now be sent and retrieved in a matter of seconds, which is a dramatic improvement and has increased the number of clients wanting to do business with it. The NBN means that distance is no longer an impediment to running a successful business, which is crucial for businesses in regional and rural Australia. This is just one example of the many success stories that highlight how the NBN is changing lives and creating opportunities.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Midway Point is joined by Scottsdale and Smithton as the towns where NBN services are currently available in Tasmania, and work has either commenced or will comÂ­mence in 12 months on a number of other locations. These locations are George Town, Deloraine, Triabunna, Sorell, Somerset, St Helens, Launceston, South Launceston, Bellerive, Hobart, Kingston and Claremont. In Tasmania it is estimated that within 12 months 15,000 homes will have access to the NBN, with work planned to start on an extra 76,000 in the coming year.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Despite hearing stories about the very positive impact the NBN is having on people out there in the community, those opposite are hell bent on preventing Australians from having a world-class, affordable broadband service. If they were serious about ensuring Australians are able to access world-class telecommunications infrastructure, they would support the NBN rollout, as it is supported throughout the community.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This government wants everyone to have access to high-speed broadband, no matter where they live, and we are committed to delivering it for all Australians. As we continue this mission, the TelecomÂ­munications Universal Service Management Agency Bill 2011, the Telecommunications Legislation Amendment (Universal Service Reform) Bill 2011 and the TelecomÂ­munications (Industry Levy) Bill 2011 are part of a package of legislation aimed at enabling the continuity of key telecomÂ­munications safeguards. These bills are part of the next stage in the government's reform agenda for the telecommunications industry. The bills seek to reform the arrangements for the delivery of universal service and public policy outcomes. This will aid the evolution to the NBN and a more competitive telecommunications market.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Breaking this package down, the Telecommunications Universal Service Management Agency Bill provides the governance, funding and accountability framework for this new statutory agency. It will ensure that universal service outcomes and other important services for the community will still be delivered in a new competitive circumstance. The new entity will guarantee that all Australians have sufficient access to a standard telephone service and payphones, guarantee the continuing delivery of the Emergency Call Service and the National Relay Service, and guarantee that appropriate safeguards are in place to support voice-only customers transferring to an NBN fibre service as Telstra's copper network is decommissioned. It will also ensure that technological solutions will be developed to support the continuity of public interest services such as public alarm systems and traffic lights. These are vital ways to ensure the continuity of basic services to Australians in light of the changes to the telecommunications industry that will take place with the rollout of the NBN, including the gradual decomÂ­missioning of Telstra's copper customer access network. The government is committed to reducing the disruption for industry and the wider community by keeping these basic safeguards.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Telstra will be required to keep its copper network to deliver voice services outside NBN fibre areas and will also be the retailer of last resort for voice-only services over the NBN fibre network. As well as providing accessible basic services, the legislation will also ensure that the new agency operates in an accountable and transparent manner. It will be required to keep a publicly available register with key terms and services to be provided under all contracts and grants, as well to as prepare annual reports and corporate plans. There will be a review before 1 January 2018 to consider how effective the agency has been. The estimated total cost of the agency is $340 million per year for its first two years and around $330 million per year following that. To help with these costs the government is contributing at least $50 million in funding per year for the first two financial years and $100 million per year after that.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The Telecommunications Legislation Amendment (Universal Service Reform) Bill chiefly amends telecommunications legislation to assist the new arrangements for delivery of universal service outcomes within the telecommunications sector and to facilitate the establishment of the new agency and the changeover to new levy arrangements. An important part of the bill is the proposal of a robust framework for contracting with service providers for the delivery of universal service outcomes and related public interest services in the telecommunications sector. The TelecomÂ­munications (Industry Levy) Bill is a bill that ensures the government can raise the consolidated industry levy. This package of legislation further progresses the work the government is doing to reform the telecomÂ­munications industry and continue with the rollout of the NBN. The government is committed to giving all Australians access to affordable and high-speed broadband services. The NBN is critical infrastructure that will connect Australians with each other and the world, and I commend the bills to the Senate.</span>

                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">
                    <a href="H6X" type="MemberSpeech">
                      <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Senator BIRMINGHAM</span>
                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">South Australia</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">09:45</span>):  I rise to speak on the Telecommunications Universal Service Management Agency Bill 2011 and related bills. But, with the indulgence of the Senate, I will just touch on a couple of other matters initially. Firstly, because I may not have a chance on the record at any other time today to say this, I note that today, being the last day of February, is the culmination of Ovarian Cancer Awareness Month. Knowing that Senator Conroy's office would be monitoring this, as this is his legislation, I note the participation of Senator Conroy and in particular his wife, Paula, in the ovarian cancer breakfast held in Parliament House this morning, and I note in this place, appropriately, the memories that many have of my predecessor in this Senate seat and your predecessor, Mr Deputy President, as Liberal Party whip, Senator Jeannie Ferris, who did so much to raise awareness of ovarian cancer during her battle, which she ultimately succumbed to, with ovarian cancer.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This legislation has come on a little earlier than anticipated because of the filibustering tactics the Greens are employing on the radioactive waste legislationâ€”a shameful tactic from the Greens, who do not seem to recognise the importance to Australia of ensuring that we have a central repository for radioactive waste in this country. I note that having brought this debate on, though, this has moved out into an area of legislation where there is some broad agreement of principle and some concern over detail.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The universal service obligation is an important tenet and feature of Australia's telecommunications policy. It requires that basic telecommunications services, including home telephone services, business telephone services and payphones, be accessible to all Australians in a fair and equitable basis at an affordable price. The universal service obligation is especially important for telecommunications consumers in rural and regional Australia, as it ensures that basic telco services are available where it may not otherwise be economically viable for telecommunications companies to provide them. Without this subsidy, the tyranny of distance would be all the greater for many rural Australians who may not be able to afford basic services. For this reason, the coalition strongly support the USO. We have always done so, and we continue to do so. It is consistent with our overall support for communications services of the highest standard and order in rural and regional Australia.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Our support has not just been for the USO. If we look at what we had in place at the end of the Howard government, we see that we had in place a number of measures that were designed to provide a better standard and to continually raise the standard and the bar of telco services for rural and regional Australians. I think immediately of the regional telecommunications fundâ€”$2 billion that had been set aside to be able to provide a constant source of funding to upgrade services to rural and regional Australians. Sadly, that fund is no more because, like all available piggy banks under this government, it has been raided and spent. It was spent in this case on the National Broadband Network, which thus far is not exactly rolling out vast new services in rural and regional Australia at a rapid pace.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Indeed, if we compare the NBN and where it is up to in its provision of, especially, wireless services to regional communities with what the coalition had in place at the end of the Howard government, we will see that we were on track to deliver wireless services to regional communities within a few years. They would have already had services under the OPEL contract that would have provided for better regional telecommunications services today than they currently have. That would have been delivered under a contract signed by the previous government and funded by the previous government and that would already have been operational today. Instead, we continue to hear promises but see delays from the government as it rolls out the NBN. We hear promises but there are delays and therefore consumers in rural and regional Australia are still waiting to see the genuine benefits of this claimed NBN.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Telstra currently delivers the universal service obligation. Being a former monopoly provider and the owner of much of Australia's fixed line telecommunications infrastructure, Telstra's role in this is understandable. Current regulation requires Telstra to provide basic services at an equitable rate. To compensate Telstra for this obligation, all telco carriers are levied, with the majority of funds raised provided to Telstra to offset the cost of their undertakings in this area. Presently the levy raised is approximately $145 million. This legislation also affects the provision of the Emergency Call Service and the National Relay Service. The National Relay Service delivers voice-equivalent services to Australians with speech or hearing impairments through voice-to-text and text-to-voice technologies. The NRS, I understand, costs around $17 million under its current contract provider.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Telstra has argued for some time that the fees levied from service providers which it receives to compensate it for the cost it incurs in relation to the provision of the USO are insufficient. Unsurprisingly, Telstra's retail competitors, who are levy payers, have opposed any increase to the levy. This legislation provides ultimately a convenient escape from this argument between companies. The government commissioned the Castalia report, an independent expert report, to consider this matter. It found that the cost of providing the USO combined with the cost of the NRS and provision of public payphones amounted to at least $250 million and up to $300 million annually. While this will in theory end the argument between Telstra and other retail service providers, it opens up a new potential front for argument between retail telco service providers and the government and in particular the new Telecommunications Universal Service Management Agency, TUSMA. We have seen that already with many of the other retail service providers in the telco space questioning the validity of the Castalia report and the costs and doubting whether the sums involved are indeed appropriate. While the current USO was appropriate while Telstra was the owner and operator of Australia's fixed line telecommunications network, with the changed environment foreshadowed by the government through their NBN and of course the planned ripping out of the copper network right around Australiaâ€”if, indeed, this ever does occur given the appallingly slow or extravagantly expensive rollout of the NBN to dateâ€”it makes sense to plan to alter the arrangements of the USO to fit with the government's overall policy direction. This bill is before us largely because Labor is seeking to create the NBNâ€”a massive government owned communications infrastructure monopoly that will stifle competition and innovation in Australia's telecommunications sector, but that should not be any surprise to anybody given that private ownership, efficiency, competition and business innovation are anathema to what this government stands for. Nonetheless, as the government intends to limit facilities based competition by ripping copper line from the ground and implementing its new regulatory regime with a monopoly fibre provider, we must address the provision of the important services contained in the USO.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">On the coalition side we expect transparency and competition in government tenders for services. The question here is whether the processes set out through this legislation and already undertaken by the government as part of the new TUSMA arrangement actually meet with those expectations of the coalition. This process sees the costs of services revealed and openly and transparently funded by both taxpayers and the retail service providersâ€”not to mention it removes a somewhat onerous regulatory requirement from a private business: Telstra. This is all something that our party welcomes. If only the NBN as a whole was as transparent and up-front about the costs, subsidies and competitive impacts of this unprecedented government intervention.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">While I welcome the increased transparency of the amount involved and the replacement of the USO and NRS levies with a single levy and the funding arrangements for it, there is of course, as always with Labor, a catch. As we have seen so openly this week, there is always more than meets the eye. Whenever Labor seeks to simplify, the outcome is always more complex. Whenever Labor seeks to cut costs, the outcome is always more expensive. Whenever Labor seeks to reduce regulation, the outcome is always a new bureaucracy. Labor talks of efficient government and transparent government, but it is of course addicted to bloated, big, inefficient government.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">These bills sadly provide for more of the same in some ways. These bills create yet another new bureaucracy. We all know Labor has never seen a bureaucracy that it did not like. This time it is the TelecomÂ­munications Universal Service Management Agency, or TUSMAâ€”a mouthful if you do not take the acronym. TUSMA will be created to do what the Australian Communications and Media Authority already does in partâ€”that is, assume responsibility for the USO. I am not sure why the minister lacked confidence in the ACMA to administer all of the operation of the USO, and perhaps he can explain this for us when he sums up. Indeed, perhaps he needs some extra positions to appoint some of his Labor mates to. Maybe we will even see Senator Arbib bobbing up and helping with the USO in his next life. As I understand it, the ACMA will of course continue to collect the industry levy, which will fund the USO. I understand that ACMA has staff of around 40 engaged in the responsibility for the USO and associated aspects. TUSMA will oversee the new regime and it will come at an administrative cost of around $5 million.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I mentioned earlier that the coalition, by our very nature, expect open and transparent tenders for government services, so it is therefore disappointing that, far from taking the opportunity to put the USO and NRS services out to a competitive, open tender, the government have entered into a 20-year contract with Telstra. We all know that Telstra's cooperation and acquiescence to the NBN model is essential for the success of the NBN model. Obviously in this case we see that, even with the USO contract, it does appear to have the image, as suggested by many, of being wrapped up as a potential little sweetener valued at around $2.7 billion over 10 years for Telstra.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">One of the TUSMA jobs is to enter into contracts for the delivery of the USO. That begs the question that, if one of their core jobs is to enter into contracts for delivery of the USO but the government has already agreed to the first 20 years worth of contracts, perhaps the new bureaucratic agency is going to have a rather quiet first 20 years. Indeed, the Department of Broadband, Communications and the Digital Economy said as much during the inquiry into these bills. Departmental deputy secretary Mr Quinlivan stated:</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">These measures were agreed to support the government's broader package of telecomÂ­munications reforms, implementation of the NBN and, most importantly in this context, the structural separation of Telstra.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We see an admission there from the department that this is not a pure approach about simply the provision of universal services to rural and regional Australians; this of course is all embedded in the government's approach to the implemenÂ­tation of the NBN and the structural of separation of Telstra. Yesterday, the ACCC approved a much revised structural separaÂ­tion undertaking between the government and Telstraâ€”a structural separation undertaking that at least now does not include some of the remarkable provisions that NBN Co. and the government had sought to impose upon Telstra in the first place. Those conditions would have seen them limited to the manner in which they conducted competition for their non-fixed line businesses and non-fibre businesses and would have seen them not able to effectively promote their wireless services against NBN Co.'s monopoly services, because so scared is the government of any semblance of competition against its NBN model. I do not begrudge Telstra receiving this contract. It probably is at the current point in time the best placed of Australia's service providers to deliver it, given, of course, that it continues to be with the copper line being the product provided to the overwhelming majority of Australian premises. It is the owner of that service and the one best placed to ensure its maintenance and continuance into the future. We have the strange situation under the NBN model and under this proposal that the copper line is going to have to be maintained in certain parts of Australia for an indefinite period of time. Whilst the government proposes to rip up, switch off and disconnect the copper line services for 93 per cent of Australian premisesâ€”if, of course, it ever gets that far with its NBNâ€”there is a question mark that remains for the remainder and an uncertainty as to how the services under the USO are going to be provided to those remaining households into the future in a cost-effective manner for all involved. The problem that we have, however, with the Telstra contract, with the report that was undertaken and with the approach going forward is that we will never know for sure if due process really was followed. Certainly we know that there was no real open tender conducted at this stage of events.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Senator Conroy, as the responsible minister, has quite an interesting history when it comes to tenders. I reflect on NBN stage 1 and the tender that was undertaken at that stage to provide the fibre-to-the-node broadband service. Fibre to the node was what the Labor government was originally elected promising. This was, if my memory is correct, a $4.7 billion promise.</span>

                    </a>  Senator Ludwig wants to ask if we have bought the copper. As I just reflected, Senator Ludwig, large parts of Australiaâ€”including large parts of rural and regional Australia, critical to your portfolioâ€”are in theory going to continue to be reliant on copper services under this proposal for an indefinite period of time into the future. But Senator Conroy went through that $4.7-ish billion contract for NBN stage 1, for fibre-to-the-node services, only, having spent millions of dollars on that tender, to have to abandon and scrap it, having wasted countless hours of government and private sector time, and to come up with a new model that just shifted the decimal place across by one so that we ended up with something closer to a $50 billion proposal. Clearly it was not a big deal to the government, because equally, as we all know, it was all dreamt up on the back of a serviette, or both sides of a serviette, or both sides of an envelope or a drinks coaster, on that famous VIP flight between Melbourne and Brisbane.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Senator Conroy, of course, continued his interesting history with tender processes in the recent Australia Network contract debacle that the government engaged in, which once again saw millions of dollars and countless hours of government and private sector time wasted on a botched tender process that is now the subject of dual investigations by the Australian Federal Police and the Auditor-General's office. But I digress. Senator Conroy has so many problems and debacles that I could not possibly cover them all now, so I shall return to the issue of TUSMA.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The coalition is concerned that telecommunications service providers, and ultimately consumers and taxpayers, will end up potentially paying more as a result of TUSMA and the arrangements in place. TUSMA's running costs will be paid and borne in part by taxpayers, at least over the immediate future, and of course by the telecommunications industry through the levy structure, with the government initially providing a flat $100 million contribution to provide the gap between existing levy arrangements and the expected funding necessary for the new USO arrangements. Of course, the industry levy structure in the future has the risk and the fear that there is a lack of incentive to rein in costs, and that has created fears that many retail service providers expressed to the Senate inquiry: they feared that the hit to industry and the costs to consumers will continue to grow and grow. Perhaps, if the government had conducted proper consultations on this matter, the reform would not have caused the concern in the telco sector that we heard about through the Senate inquiry. There was genuine concern about the consultation process and the government's admissions, effectively, that this was all wrapped up before the final legislation was developed. So we come to this process wanting to support the USO and accepting that a new model is necessary given the government's policy direction but with concerns about the bureaucracy and costs which will be expressed later. <span style="font-style:italic;">(Time expired)</span></span>

                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">New South Wales</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">10:05</span>):  I am pleased to rise to support the Telecommunications Universal Service Management Agency Bill 2011, the TUSMA Bill, and also the Telecommunications Legislation Amendment (Universal Service Reform) Bill 2011, or the reform bill, and the Telecommunications (Industry Levy) Bill 2011, or the levy bill. This legislative package delivers on the reforms to the universal service obligation announced by the government in June 2010 when Telstra entered into the financial heads of agreement with NBN Co. that set in motion Telstra's structural separation. I am pleased that that structural separation was approved by the ACCC yesterday. It is something that those opposite could never achieve in 11Â½ years of government. The bills will allow the progressive migration of Telstra's customers to the NBN Co.'s fibre network, a network that takes Australia into the modern age of telecommunications.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The three bills the government proposes to introduce to parliamentâ€”the TUSMA Bill, the Telecommunications Legislation AmendÂ­ment (Universal Service Reform) Bill and the Telecommunications (Industry Levy) Billâ€”represent further steps in the governÂ­ment's reform agenda for the telecomÂ­munications industry. Together the bills form a legislative package to reform the long-term arrangements for the delivery of universal service outcomes and related public policy outcomes, which will facilitate the transition to the National Broadband Network and a more competitive and open telecomÂ­munications market. These bills are part of the broad package delivering the NBN, and the resulting retail competition will certainly be a boon to all Australian consumers.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The TUSMA Bill will provide the governance, funding, and reporting<span style="font-weight:bold;">/</span>accountÂ­ability framework for this new statutory agency to make sure that universal service outcomes and other key public interest services continue to be delivered effectively in this new competitive environment. TUSMA will have responsibility for putting in place contracts or grants so that all Australians continue to have reasonable access to a standard telephone service and payphonesâ€”it is absolutely essential that payphones still be available in many regional areas and absolutely essential that consumers have access to standard telephone services. I want to make it clear that people will not be forced into any complex or confusing service arrangement with any of the providers. Australians will have reasonable access to standard telephone services and payphones. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">It is also important that calls to the Emergency Call Service will continue to be handled and transferred to the relevant emergency service organisation. We have witnessed some of the most devastating disasters in this country over recent years, and the government is well aware that we have to continue to provide an Emergency Call Service under these new proposals. TUSMA will also be responsible for ensuring that the National Relay Service continues to provide voice-equivalent services for those with a hearing or speech impairment. This government is absolutely committed to ensuring that people who have impediments, either physical or mental, have access to reasonable and decent services. That is what building a good society is about. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Appropriate consumer safeguards will be in place to support voice-only customers migrating to an NBN fibre service as Telstra's copper network is decommissioned. I have heard a lot of talk about why the copper network should be maintained, but I have also heard in my position as chair of the Senate Environment and Communications Legislation Committee about the problems with the copper networkâ€”why the copper network is decaying around the country, why the copper network is costing more and more to maintain and why we need to make sure that we do migrate to an NBN fibre service that ensures the telecommunications security and telecommunications initiatives that a modern country needs to take its place in an international economy that is becoming more and more productive and more and more competitive. We need the NBN to deliver in that area. So customers who remain fixed-line voice-only customers after migration will have appropriate safeguards.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Technological solutions will be developed as necessary to support continuity of public interest servicesâ€”for example, public alarm systems and traffic lights. We all know what happens when traffic lights go downâ€”it causes absolute chaos. It is a productivity issue, it is a social issue, people cannot get home, and companies end up losing production if there are traffic jams and traffic chaos, especially in our bigger cities. Technological solutions will be developed to support continuity of these public interest services.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">A key focus for the government is to minimise disruption for consumers and industry by maintaining basic safeguards as the NBN fibre network is rolled out and replaces the old copper network. Telstra is being required to maintain its copper network to deliver voice services outside NBN fibre areas. There are some areas where the copper network is rolled out where the NBN fibre will not go in, but for voice the government is requiring Telstra to maintain that copper network. Importantly, under the agreement Telstra made with the government, announced on 23 June 2011, Telstra will also be required to be the 'retailer of last resort' for voice-only services over the NBN fibre network.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The TUSMA legislation will ensure that basic telecommunications services remain available to all Australians and that the new agency responsible for delivering these services operates efficiently, transparently and with a high degree of accountability. The TUSMA Bill creates a rigorous oversight and accountability framework for TUSMA's activities. This includes a requirement that it maintain a publicly available register with key terms and services to be provided under all contracts and grants it makes. TUSMA will also be required to prepare annual reports and corporate plans and its operations will be reviewed before 1 January 2018 to consider how effective the agency has been in achieving its policy objectives.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Because of the complexity and sensitivity of many of the issues TUSMA will deal with, decisions that affect industry and consumers will be made collectively by a chair and members who together will have an appropriate mix of industry experience. TUSMA will be a statutory agency estabÂ­lished under the Financial Management and Accountability Act 1997 and its CEO and staff will be employed under the Public Service Act 1999. The arrangements for remuneration, disclosure, termination and delegation for the CEO and members of TUSMA generally reflect the standard approach under Commonwealth legislation, as set out in the Australian Communications and Media Authority Act 2005.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">It is expected that TUSMA will have total costs of $340 million per year for its first two years and around $330 million per year after that. To help it meet these costs and alleviate the burden on industry, the government for the first time is making a significant contribution of at least $50 million in budget funding per year for the first two financial years of TUSMA's operations and $100 million per year after that. The government is also consolidating the universal service obligation and the national relay service levies into a single levy. To provide a smooth transition for industry, arrangements will be put in place for 2012-13 and 2013-14 so non-Telstra contributors do not have to contribute more than their aggregate liability for the USO and NRS levies in 2011-12. The contribution of each participant towards the proposed new levy will be based, as is currently the case, on its eligible revenue as assessed by the Australian Communications and Media Authority, and they will remain responsible for collecting it. Arrangements will be put in place so smaller carriers with eligible revenue of less than $25 million will not be required to contribute to the new levy, consistent with current thresholds for the USO and NRS levies.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I turn to the Telecommunications Legislation Amendment (Universal Service Reform) Bill 2011. The bill primarily amends telecommunications legislation to support the new arrangements for delivery of universal service outcomes within the telecommunications sector, and facilitates the establishment of TUSMA and the smooth transition to new levy arrangements. The government has previously committed to removing USO regulation. A key aspect of the bill is a proposed framework so that after a transitional period the minister may remove USO regulatory obligations from Telstra and move to a complete contractual delivery model. USO regulation can only be removed if the minister is satisfied within two years after commencement that there are satisfactory contractual arrangements in place. The minister will be required to take into account Telstra's record of compliance with its contract and regulatory obligations and any other relevant matters. Separate decisions are required in relation to the standard telephone service and payphone elements of the USO and each decision is subject to disallowance by parliament.</span>
                </p>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">If there are satisfactory contract arrangements in place, the payphones element of USO regulation will be removed across Australia; and STS USO regulation will be removed in areas that will not be covered by the NBN fibre network. STS regulation in NBN fibre areas will be progressively removed as the NBN fibre network is rolled out and Telstra implements structural separation in those areas by closing down its copper network. Even if STS USO regulation is progressively removed, the existing regulated customer service guarantee that applies to all providers of the standard telephone service will continue to apply to telephone services provided by Telstra under the TUSMA contract.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I now turn to the Telecommunications (Industry Levy) Bill. The TelecomÂ­munications (Industry Levy) Bill is a short bill that ensures that the government can raise the consolidated industry levy. I chaired the inquiry of the Senate Standing ComÂ­mittee on Environment and Communications into the bill and our report was tabled last Friday. Despite some concerns about the industry levy proposed in the bill, the telecommunications industry representatives supported the structural separation of Telstra and agreed that their positions in the market will be more competitive as the NBN is implemented. That is a key point. This is the industry conceding that there will be more competition as NBN is implementedâ€”not less, as the argument has been put by the coalition. As a consequence of submissions from the Telecommunications Industry Ombudsman, the committee recommended that TUSMA and the TIO enter into the necessary agreements to share certain information to assist TUSMA's monitoring and reporting responsibilities and that the TUSMA bill be amended to enable TUSMA to disclose information to the Telecommunications Industry Ombudsman. This is about transparency and openness in the industry and for customers to have confidence that the whole approach is working not just for the industry but for the community.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Our inquiry also heard from the Australian Communications Consumer Action Network. As a consequence of what they had to say, we recommended that the TUSMA Bill be amended to make it a criterion for one of the appointments to TUSMA to be a person with experience or knowledge of consumer affairsâ€”again, an important part of ensuring that there is confidence in the whole NBN approach. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">These bills before the Senate today are a part of building one of Australia's biggest infrastructure programs ever. That infrastructure program, the NBN, is about delivering affordable high-speed broadband to all Australians, no matter where they live. The NBN is already in use in Tasmania, Armidale, suburban Melbourne and Kiama. Recently, it was announced that Australia's two largest telecommunications companies, Telstra and Optus, had signed up to the NBN, and we had yesterday an announceÂ­ment that the ACCC has given final approval to develop the NBN. That is a major landmark for the nation's telecommunicaÂ­tions industry. The National Broadband Network is a key nation-building infraÂ­structure project. The project will deliver significantly improved broadband services for all Australians at affordable prices. It will connect our cities, our regional centres and our rural communitiesâ€”something that the coalition never imagined and could never achieve in 11Â½ years of government. This reforms Australia's telecommunications sector. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The NBN is critical to our future digital productivity growth. It will deliver high-speed, reliable broadband to every home and business in Australia. The NBN will provide access to high-speed broadband to 100 per cent of Australian premises. Ninety-three per cent of those premises will have access to a high-speed fibre network capable of providing broadband speeds of up to 1 gigabit per second. Seven per cent of Australian premises will have access to next-generation fixed wireless and satellite technologies providing peak speeds of 12 megabits per second. For a country like Australia, with its massive area to cover, with the concentration of populations on the coastal fringes of our country, to be able to act to provide high-speed broadband to the whole country is a nation-building exercise. It is one of the best infrastructure projects this country has ever seen and it allows Australia to improve its productivity, to improve its communications and to take its place as a modern society as the rest of the world continues to adopt broadband infrastructure.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">But the NBN is just a platform; it is the use of the NBN that will enable our businesses to develop new and efficient ways of doing thingsâ€”new and efficient ways of improving productivity and improving communications. The NBN infrastructure supports the evolution of the Australian economy by inspiring a new wave of digital innovation that will change and improve the way Australians live, receive services and connect with the world. It will drive productivity improvement across Australian businesses by improving logistics, expanding customer bases and creating new ways of working. It will transform service delivery, increasing efficiency and effectiveness in areas such as health, education and government services. Why should AustÂ­ralians in the regional areas of this country not have access to the best medical advice? The NBN delivers that. This is a transforming approach by this government. It will transform the economy, it will transform health delivery, it will transform education, it will transform every aspect of the economy.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">These bills before the parliament today help that process to come to fruition. These are major initiatives by the government and they should be supported by the whole parliament.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">
                    <a href="I07" type="MemberSpeech">
                      <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Senator LUDLAM</span>
                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Western Australia</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">10:25</span>):  I enjoyed hearing Senator Cameron's remarks, and I will follow on in a similar vein. The Greens will rise, as the coalition has done, to support these bills. The Telecommunications Universal Service Management Agency Bill 2011 and the package of other measures in the related bills that come with it are really the last legislative pieces of the puzzle for the National Broadband Network rollout. This is something that I have taken a keen interest in since I arrived here. It has been one of the defining issues, obviously, in the communications portfolio. This last piece, effectively, of the regulatory framework is certainly deserving of support.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The bills create a new statutory agency to deliver basic voice, payphone and other public interest telecommunications services at an ongoing cost to the taxpayer of $100 million per year. We heard evidence during the hearings Senator Cameron referred to in the committee that he chairs that maybe we should not be doing that anymore. Some sections of industry think, 'In an NBN world, why should we be keeping the copper network up and why should we be providing these services to people when the age of broadband is here?' The fact is that the age of broadband is not yet here. Certainly in Canberra we get services and in Melbourne we get services. In regional areas and in some outer suburban areas where costs have been cut over the last couple of years, in fact services are terrible. So it is extremely important that we maintain the universal service obligation. We believe, actually, that it should be extendedâ€”that it should be brought into the 21st century. But at the very least, while the NBN project rolls out, there is the need to preserve and protect services and to make sure that they are not cut, particularly in areas where services have never been great in the first place.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The bills also mandate reviews in the future to assess exactly how well the USO is being delivered in an NBN world. This is an issue that will need to be revisited. We welcomed input into the Senate inquiry from consumers and from end users who convinced the committee on the need for a consumer affairs representative on the TUSMA board. As Senator Cameron outlined, that was one of the recommendations that the committee took up and has proposed. I understand that the government is interested in pursuing that amendment. The Australian Greens obviously believe that the USO should be brought into the 21st century. It is not merely voice telephony and public payphones. Really what we are talking about in this age is fast data services.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The broadband network is one of the most important infrastructure projects that this country has seen. The network, once established, will bring us closer to the rest of the world and it will be the envy of many countries, given that 93 per cent of the population will have fibre coverage to homes, schools and businesses and other premises. The other seven per cent of Australia's population will have data services through wireless and satellite. It will not be as good as you can get in the metro areas, but it is a huge step change in advance of what we have been able to deliver to people thus far.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Given convergence and the increasing reliance on data services to conduct business in the daily lives of so many people, data services have become an essential service just as much as public telephony has been for many years. We welcome the work of advocates like ACCAN for remembering that this is about people. We have tended to come in here on NBN bills and have long and exotic debates about engineering problems and about competition policy, and we tend to forget that these services are about people. The really interesting questions are around what we will do with the services when they do become ubiquitous.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Some issues with the bill were raised during the committee process. Some of the smaller telcos do not believe that they should continue to pay for the USO. They think that if Telstra is out there maintaining this infrastructure then either the price tag for providing those services should be lower or they should be somehow exempt from contributing. We believe, in line with the general principal, that the areas that are easy to serviceâ€”the big cities, where the profit margins can be madeâ€”should cross-subsidise services in regional areas. I do not think it should be controversial that services should be cross-subsidised in the USO. Effectively, it is one way of doing that for areas where services are patchy. We disagree with the smaller telcos and some of the providers in that instance. We think it is important to maintain the USO.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Perhaps in 10 or 20 years it will be obsolete. Perhaps by then we will have closed the copper network down and we will be providing fast data services and there will be no need for the hardline. But I would imagine that, even though people certainly are abandoning fixed-line services in homes and are transitioning across to mobiles, it is still an essential service. The copper infrastructure still has value and it still provides services that cannot be delivered, at least in 2012, through other forms of technology.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">In their evidence, Macquarie and Optus certainly argued that the NBN should render the USO obsolete. Why don't we revisit that question in a decade. Provided the coalition do not destroy the project, do not rip it up or do not flog the pieces off to private industry in an attempt to somehow balance their budget black hole, we should have a piece of infrastructure that will be providing ubiquitous, fast data services to most Australians and will also be generating a return to the Australian people. That is important to remember. In the obsession with privatising essential public services and monopoly infrastructure, we are building an asset. The reason it is off budget is that we are building an asset that will return a small premium back to the taxpayer as it is paying off its debts.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">ACCAN, representing end users in the committee hearings, argued for a more integrated approach to providing disability access to telecommunications services. They propose that a range of services be brought under the TUSMA umbrella to be managed in a more integrated way than they are at the moment. We were told at the hearings that the minister was contemplating it but that it was too early and the bills would need to be passed first, so we do not have resolution on that. It is something I think this chamber should pursue. People who are interested in telecommunications and in making them available to people with any form of disability should uphold the mandate that we are extending these services to all Australians. We cannot forget that perhaps this is only part of the job.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Competitors to Telstra have argued that it is not appropriate for the government to simply contract out USO services to Telstra for the next 20 years as a consequence of the deal that was done between the government and Telstra to enable the NBN to go ahead. I have some sympathy for that point of view, because we know that this deal was done behind closed doors in an effort to get Telstra on board and that the universal service obligation had to go somewhere. I think it is appropriate that it has been brought back into public hands, but of course the industry notedâ€”I think correctlyâ€”that all we are doing is simply contracting these services straight back out to Telstra, mostly, because they still hold the copper asset.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The bill as drafted does, however, maintain a 20th-century incarnation of the USO, but only for access to voice services. This is something the Australian Greens will be pursuing. I do not think that in the 21st century it is appropriate to contemplate a universal service obligation being simply a voice service. We have moved on. The government has quite correctly proposed a huge investment in telecommunications in this country precisely to provide fast data services to people. Therefore, I think the USO itself, and what we understand by the term 'universal service', should be updated and brought into the 21st century. We will revisit those issues.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The committee made a number of recommendationsâ€”it only made threeâ€”and I think we should propose a fourth: that the Telecommunications Universal Service Management Agency and the TIO, the Telecommunications Industry Ombudsman, enter into a memorandum of understanding to formalise arrangements for the TIO to provide information to TUSMA for the purposes of TUSMA's monitoring and reporting responsibilities. That is just common sense. If the government moves that amendment we will certainly be supporting it.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Recommendation two was that the bill be amended to make it a criterion for one of the appointments to the membership of TUSMA to be a person with substantial experience or knowledge and significant standing in the field of consumer affairs. Again, the Greens believe that that is entirely reasonable, and we were persuaded by the evidence given by ACCAN in their advocacy work for the people who will actually use this technology.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The committee then recommended that the bills be passed. The Australian Greens believe that we need to revisit the idea of what the USO is. What is the universal service obligation? It is not simply a voice service in the 21st century; it is something more than that. We believe those issues should be revisited.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Yesterday we saw a huge piece of the puzzle fall into place outside this chamber concerning the bills that we passed well over a year ago now relating to the structural separation of Telstraâ€”to separate out its wholesale and retail arms. Having that agreement signed off by the regulator was an incredibly important piece of the puzzle. The regulator had been holding out for a better deal for Telstra's competitors, for the smaller carriers and for the aggregators, who will take services from the NBN. That is a question about how the competitive landscape looks over the eight- or nine-year rollout of the NBN. It was tremendously important to get that agreement on the books. It removes a significant impediment to the volume rollout. Mr Quigley of NBN Co. told a budget estimates committee the week before last that the delaying of regulatory approvals by the ACCC was having a material impact on the volume rolloutâ€”on when we actually scale the build up and start rolling past not thousands but tens and then hundreds of thousands of premises. This was being held up because the ACCC and Telstra had not been able to come to an agreement.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">So, what do we have? We have the regulator on board. We have Telstra on board, despite their fierce resistance to the bills. We have to coalition on board for the structural separation undertaking. Mr Turnbull confirmed that for us yesterday. They made it sound like the idea of disaggregating the wholesale and retail arms of Telstra had been their idea all along. The fact is that the coalition held up that proposal and that bill for a year. It cost us a year in the rollout, because former senator Nick Minchin was simply in here advocating for what he thought was the best interests of Telstra. As it has turned out, the best interest of Telstra is to take its place as a retail incumbent in an NBN world with a huge expansion of a customer base into regional areas, where services have never been provided before, and to get out and compete in the marketplace as a private entity. We do not think Telstra should have ever been privatised, but since it was it should play by the rules that everybody else has to play by.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We still do not know when exactly the coalition is going to drop its strange objection to the rollout. I do not understand why or how the National Partyâ€”and Senator Williams is in the chamber with us this morningâ€”has stayed silent while its coalition partners try to wreck a proposal to bring world-class telecommunications to regional areas. What on earth are you doing?</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I think it is high time the opposition simply dropped its destructive opposition to this project. It creates a degree of uncertainty amongst the NBN engineers, the people building the project and, most importantly, the people in the communities scheduled to get the services when you have the shadow spokesperson or the Leader of the Opposition marching around the landscape saying they are going to destroy the project. It is unbelievable. Let us simply get on with it.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I look forward to the committee stage of the debate on these bills. I look forward to seeing, hopefully, the government taking up some of the proposals that were put to it by the committee. I thank the committee staff and secretariat and the other members of the committee for their contributions, and we look forward to the passage of the bills.</span>

                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">South Australia</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">10:38</span>):  Following on from my colleague Senator Birmingham, can I say the coalition of course supports the implementation and continuation of the universal service obligation. The coalition reluctantly recognises the need to rejig that obligation, given that this government seems so bloody-minded as to continue to implement its National Broadband Network. In that context the coalition accepts the need to deal with this legislation.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The problem we have with it is that we simply do not trust the government to deliver, given that it is insisting on creating a new bureaucracy to deal with the universal service obligation and given that there is, arguably, already in placeâ€”in ACMAâ€”a body that could be given the task of doing it, particularly given that the new body will not have any incentive to constrain its own costs. It will be funded to the tune of a flat $100 million, with any costs over and above that to be raised by an industry levy. That is, it will be paid for by participants in the industry. Ultimately, those costs will be passed on to consumers. And whilst TUSMA, the new agency, will be constrained by its policy objectives, the Telecommunications Universal Service Management Agency Bill 2011 gives the minister the discretion to expand the tasks TUSMA hasâ€”for example, on a public interest basis.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The Australian Communications Consumer Action Network has already recommended that the objectives of TUSMA be expandedâ€”for example, to provide for people with a disability. That may well be a very good cause, and one can imagine the pressure to be put on the good ministerâ€”the minister for technology and gadgetsâ€”to expand the objectives of TUSMA to cover that.

When the government first announced a version of its National BroadÂ­band Network dream it was, as Senator Birmingham correctly said, a $4.7 billion promise for fibre to the node. When the tender fell in a heap, that promise was aborted and replaced by the promise that this government is now struggling to implement: the promise of a $43 billion fibre-to-the-home network. But the rollout of the NBN has been plagued by delays, secrecy, overspending and lack of transparency. Just a fortnight ago at estimates we were told that NBN Co. is falling well short of the fibre targets that NBN Co. projectedâ€”</span>

It was the government's task to ensure that these assumptions did come to bear so that you could deliver on your overall promise for the NBN. But not only did NBN Co. fail to deliver on its projection, it has spectacularly failed to deliverâ€”or should I say demonstrably failed, because 'spectacuÂ­larly' is meant to be a good word, and it is not good that they have failed to deliver.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The NBN Co. corporate plan, published in 2010, promised that fibre would pass by some 260,000 premises by June of this year. Yet, to date, just under 19,000 premises have been passed with fibre. And passing them with fibre is just the first step, because then they have to bother with getting connected. Some 19,000 of some 260,000 is only seven per cent of the target. That is a compelling 93 per cent shortfall from target, or some 240,000 premises, that NBN Co. has to address in the next four monthsâ€”which it will not do, of courseâ€”in order to realise the target that it set two years ago. Because the assumptions failed to be met, NBN Co. did not pass fibre by one house in the last six months of last year. The ACCC's approval of the technical criteria in recent days will now free up the rollout of the NBN. We look forward to that changing. But we have little confidence that NBN Co.â€”or this governmentâ€”will be able to deliver many of the targets that it puts before the Australian people.</span>

In answer to a specific question during the committee inquiry about the TUSMA model for the delivery of the USO and the negotiations with Telstra about the Telstra agreement, particularly as to whether future payments from TUSMA, the new agency, to Telstra under the Telstra agreement were a financial gain to Telstra, the department said:</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Of course, coalition senators, as part of what Senator Cameron said was 'my inquiry', considered at one pointâ€”as the minority on the committee inquiry chaired by Senator Cameronâ€”that the negotiations were deficient.

                  <span class="HPS-Small">all I can say is that the negotiations with Telstra were very difficult. Whether there is a margin in there for Telstra I simply do not know. Telstra would not tell us and they did not tell you. Nobody else knows, so I cannot answer your question definitively. All I can say is that we did our best to negotiate a minimum price and we had some independent reassurance. </span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The total lack of transparency in developing the TUSMA model and negotiating the agreement with Telstra to contract to deliver the USO is a fundamental concern given this government's track record on the rollout of the rest of the NBN, but it is hardly a surprise. I said earlier that Telstra has no incentive to constrain costs. From 2014 to 2015 the government's contributionâ€”so read for that from the taxpayersâ€”will be a flat $100 million and any blowout in TUSMA's costs will be recoverable through an industry levy with those costs ultimately to be passed on to consumers.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I also said earlier that we struggle to understand the necessity to create a new bureaucracy. As my good colleague Senator Birmingham said, this government has never met a bureaucracy that it did not love. Not only do we struggle to understand that, and I do not think that is to do with our IQ; it is particularly hard to understand that given that the government has largely removed the need for the new agency, TUSMA, to make decisions about contracts to deliver the USO for the next 20 years because that is done and dusted with this bill. It is only after the next 20 years that it is opened up to competition for others to deliver.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">In the time that is remaining I want to raise some of the evidence that was given to the committee. For example, there is that from Macquarie Telecom, which said it was concerned about many aspects of the bills before the committee which included the limited capacity for industry participation in negotiations or consultation, the flawed basis upon which the universal service obligation was now based and the scope of universal service, which is an issue that I addressed earlier. The Optus evidence was interesting. Optus said that the universal service obligation bills were a missed opportunity because, in Optus's view, significant structural changes were having to happen because of the deployment of the NBN so the traditional USO network was no longer requiredâ€”correct. Optus was saying that the most efficient and effective response would have been to either remove or significantly scale back that framework, hence a missed opportunity. They also talked about the increase in the cost of delivery of the USO from $160.5 million per year to $340 million per year without any additional consumer benefit and said, more so, that proposed changes to costing and funding were not, in Optus's view, competitively neutral given that Telstra's supply costs would be unchanged whilst the payments it got, which were funded by its competitors through the levy and passed on to consumers, would be significantly increased under the new arrangements. Optus also reinforced the concerns that TUSMA simply added a new level of bureaucracy and cost to the delivery of the USO which may lead to consequent cost increases and there being a barrier to long-term reform, given the fact that the minister had the ultimate discretion to expand the statutory functions that TUSMA was to perform.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Telstra was at pains to say that it supported the USO bills in the context of facilitating the implementation of the agreement and as part of Telstra's broader participation in the rollout of the NBN. But it did observe that the bills in their entirety would, in Telstra's view, increase adminisÂ­trative costs and it said it had some concerns within its own house with respect to delegations and discretions, particularly those in the lap of the minister. Other comments from other witnesses, such as ACCAN and the Telecommunications Industry Ombudsman, have been raised by colleagues, in particular Senator Ludlam.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">So it is given these contexts that the coalition continue to be concerned. Whilst we totally support the universal service obligation and the need to recharacterise it as the government continues to attempt to deliver on its National Broadband Network promises, we have little confidence that the government will do so in an effective and efficient way. That having been said, we reluctantly support this legislation.</span>

                      <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Senator CONROY</span>
                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Victoria</span>â€”<span class="HPS-MinisterialTitles">Minister for Broadband, Communications and the </span><span class="HPS-MinisterialTitles">Digital Economy, Deputy Leader of the Government in the Senate and Minister Assisting the Prime Minister on Digital Productivity</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">10:52</span>):  Firstly, can I thank all of those who have made a contribution. I welcome the opposition's constructive approach in supporting these bills, albeit with some reservations, and I am sure we will have a healthy discussion during the committee stage. We do welcome the support for the bills.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The package of three bills, the Telecommunications Universal Service Management Agency Bill 2011, the Telecommunications Legislation AmendÂ­ment (Universal Service Reform) Bill 2011 and the Telecommunications (Industry Levy) Bill 2011, will provide a flexible, accountable and transparent model for delivering and funding public policy objectives in the telecommunications sector. The reforms contained in the bills being considered are aimed at ensuring continuity of key consumer safeguards through the transition to the National Broadband Network and into the future. These include ensuring reasonable access to standard telephone services and payphones, the National Relay Service and the emergency call service. The bills address important unfinished business dating back to the privatisation of Telstra. They provide for increased transparency and rigour in the delivery of basic consumer safeguards. Under this approach, the realistic costs of delivering these important services will be appropriately recognised.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The Telecommunications Universal Service Management Agencyâ€”or TUSMA, as it has now become known asâ€”Bill 2011 will establish a new entity to support continuity of key telecommunications safeguards in the transition to the National Broadband Network. TUSMA will be a small statutory agency with responsibility for the delivery of the universal service obligationâ€”or USO, as it is more commonly knownâ€”and other public interest telecommunications services. The opposition has suggested that TUSMA will employ an army of bureaucrats. This is clearly absurd, given that TUSMA's administration costs are expected to be around $5 million per annum. It will be focused on efficient and effective contract management, despite the claims of those opposite. TUSMA will have the benefit of industry knowledge and experience, and incentives, to ensure contracts are efficiently and effectively managed. TUSMA will enter into and administer contracts and grants for these services in accordance with the policy objectives set out in the TUSMA Bill.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The creation of TUSMA is necessary because the rollout of the wholesale-only National Broadband Network and yesterday's historic acceptance of Telstra's structural separation undertaking will fundamentally change the structure of the Australian telecommunications market. These changes will see Telstra's near ubiquitous national copper fixed line network progressively decommissioned as NBN Co. rolls out its next generation fibre network. These changes will empower TUSMA to require carriage service providers to provide information or documents to TUSMA that are relevant to the achievement of the voice-only migration policy objective. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The current USO regulatory arrangements that are imposed on Telstra were designed for a market where there was a vertically integrated operator of a national telecommunications network. The new National Broadband Network environment will enable all retail service providers to offer high-quality broadband services nationally. Therefore, in this environment it is appropriate to introduce a more competitive and open model for delivering universal service and other public policy telecommunications outcomes. These new arrangements will benefit both consumers and industry by promoting more innovative, effective and efficient service delivery arrangements. They will also clearly separate policy, regulatory and contractual functions respectively between the department, the Australians Communications and Media Authorityâ€”ACMAâ€”and TUSMA. As such, TUSMA will be fulfilling different objectives to the ACMA. TUSMA will be subject to rigorous transparency and accountability requirements. This will help ensure that costs to industry do not increase unnecessarily.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The agreement with Telstra includes a range of incentives to promote cost savings. Further, a structured program of reviews provides opportunities for voice and payphone services to be provided more efficiently. In relation to concerns that TUSMA's scope should not increase unnecessarily, the legislation does provide some flexibility so that the services it delivers can be modified as circumstances change. Despite, again, the opposition's claims to the contrary, any proposed changes will be subject to clear parliamentary oversight and scrutiny.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The Telecommunications Legislation Amendment (Universal Service Reform) Bill 2011 amends the universal service regime in the Telecommunications (Consumer ProtecÂ­tion and Service Standards) Act 1999. The amendments mean that within approximately two years of commencement of TUSMA's operations the minister must consider whether it is appropriate to remove the current regulated USO on Telstra to make the standard telephone service and payphones reasonably accessible. Subject to Telstra's record of compliance with its contractual and regulatory obligations, the minister may then make declarations that will commence the process for lifting regulation and shifting to a contractual model for the provision of universal service outcomes.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The Telecommunications (Industry Levy) Bill 2011 provides for the imposition of a new levy. This levy will replace two existing separate industry levies and will contribute to meeting TUSMA's costs for delivery of the USO and other public policy telecommunications outcomes. For the first time, government will also be making a substantial contribution towards TUSMA's costs and the delivery of key comÂ­munications public interest safeguards. The government's budget contribution will be at least $50 million in 2012-13 and 2013-14 and $100 million each financial year thereafter. The government has also committed to increase its base funding in the first two financial years so that contributors to the industry levy, with the exception of Telstra, will not face an increase to that aggregate funding contribution. Furthermore, the government has also committed to review the levy arrangements and the need for any additional budget funding above its committed base funding during the course of the first two years of TUSMA<span style="&#xD;&#xA;    font-family:Tahoma;&#xD;&#xA;  ">'</span>s operation. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The TUSMA bill creates a rigorous oversight and accountability framework. The new legislation will provide for TUSMA to have a board structure and require the minister to ensure that TUSMA includes members who have substantial experience and knowledge of and significant standing in the operation of the telecommunications industry and business or financial management. These members will be expected to take a strong role in managing the costs of TUSMA activities. TUSMA will also maintain publicly available registers of the contracts and grants it administers and report annually to the minister on all significant matters relating to the performance of contractors and grant recipients. It will prepare a corporate plan every three years as well as a comprehensive annual report. It will provide reports or information to the minister on specified matters relating to the performance of TUSMA's functions and undergo a comprehensive review for 1 July 2018. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This accountability framework, together with the existing reporting requirements for statutory agencies under the FMA Act, will help give stakeholders the confidence that TUSMA will use its funding to fulfil its functions and policy objectives in an efficient, effective and appropriate manner. TUSMA will also be able to share information with other agencies and persons such as the ACCC and the ACMA. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I want to address a couple of the arguments that have been put forward by those opposite. They have argued that the government did not follow due process in negotiating its contract with Telstra for the delivery of the USO and other public interest services. However, Telstra is the primary universal service provider under legislation and is the only telecommunications provider with a national, ubiquitous fixed line network that can be used to ensure the continuity of key telecommunications services during the transition to the National Broadband Network. I would also note that there have been contestability arrangements under the USO since 2001, but no alternative providers have sought to supply services under these arrangements to date. People who are currently receiving key services need certainty that their services will not be disrupted, possibly for a long time, while a new USO provider rolls out a network or finalises negotiations for access to infrastructure. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">TUSMA<span style="&#xD;&#xA;    font-family:Tahoma;&#xD;&#xA;  ">'</span>s 20-year agreement with Telstra to deliver key services such as standard phone services and public payphones will ensure continuity of basic safeguards for Australians and will strengthen the safety net for rural and regional Australia. I know there are some on the other side of the chamber who strongly claim to support basic safeguards for rural and regional Australia and a safety net. So we welcome their support for this bill. The agreement with Telstra does notâ€”</span>

                    </a>  You are buying back the copper, mate. That is not bad. Buying back the copperâ€”that is a classic. The agreement with Telstra does not preclude contestability for other key services that TUSMA will deliver under the contract. Seriously, you are renationalising the copper. What a cracker of a policy. The opposition has claimed that other services will not be subject to contestable arrangements. This is simply not true. Existing national relay service contracts are due to expire shortly and a competitive process will need to be run by TUSMA before 1 July 2013. The government has also committed to TUSMA undertaking a competitive process for the emergency call service within five years. By introducing a more contestable and flexible model for providing the USO these bills will promote greater efficiency, transparency and competition in the delivery of the telecommunications services that Australians rely on while preserving key consumer safeguards. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">So I do commend these bills to the Senate but it is important to take into account that the National Broadband Network is being heavily contested. Senator Williams is going to slide out of the chamber nowâ€”sliding away from his commitments to regional and rural Australians, but they will be heartened by the fact that you want to renationalise. Did he check with you, Senator Fisher? Malcolm Turnbull yesterday announced that he is renationalising the copper. He said he will instruct the National Broadband Network company to take over Telstra<span style="&#xD;&#xA;    font-family:Tahoma;&#xD;&#xA;  ">'</span>s copper linesâ€”renationalising it. That is what he announced, seriously. You should not let him blogâ€”not live blog. It is really tragic. Renationalising the copperâ€”I love it. Did he clear that with anyone, Senator Birmingham? Did anybody see it at all? Did anybody at all know what he was doing yesterday? That is billions of dollars that he has committed to give to Telstra to buy an asset that is dying in the ground, that is literally disintegrating in the ground, and he is going to give them billions of dollars for it. Even when they tried that on us we would not be in it. Fair dinkum, it is a cracker of a policy. I cannot wait to hear more about it. I look forward to seeing how muchâ€”</span>

                      <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Senator MASON</span>
                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Queensland</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">11:07</span>):  Thank you to Senator Conroy. I always enjoy his interjections as well as his contributions in this place. I rise to speak on the Education Services for Overseas Students Legislation Amendment (Tuition Protection Service and Other Measures) Bill 2011 and related bills. Madam Acting Deputy President Moore, you would be aware the international education sector in our country has been through a lot lately: the global economic crisis affecting demand, increasing foreign competition, an uncompetitively high Australian dollar, well-publicised provider collapses, and, indeed, violence against overseas students. These have all been subjected to very sharp media scrutiny. Last but not least, the sector has had to adjust to a series of reforms, of which the most recent raft is contained in the three bills before the Senate today.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">It is very important that we get it right. Today'sâ€”and previousâ€”education services for overseas students bills might sound right. They might sound rather technical and, indeed, they are at one level, but these changes belie their importance to the sector. International education is Australia's fourth-largest export industry and Australia's largest personal service industry, contributing over $16 billion to our national economyâ€”not counting many less direct and less easy to quantify benefits.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I know I quote these statistics very often to the Senate and I will continue to quote them because I believe they are telling and need to gain more currency, both in the parliament and in the community. All too often still, post-secondary education, particularly but not just restricted to university education, is seen as something rather ethereal or boutique and far removed from the realities of everyday lifeâ€”something of just niche interest. Yet it benefits the Australian economy nearly as much as gold and a few billion dollars more than tourism.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">It is not our beaches, the Great Barrier Reef or the Outback that bring in most visitors to Australia. It is our lecture halls. The most common answer to the famous tourism ad slogan, 'Where the bloody hell are you?' is: 'At university, studying.' That is why it is imperative that we continue to nurture and grow this industry. International education deserves as much of our attention and appreciation as mining, tourism and manufacturing.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The proposed legislative changes before us today arise out of the <span style="font-style:italic;">Stronger, simpler, smarter ESOS: supporting</span><span style="font-style:italic;">international students</span> report conducted by the former distinguished member of the New South Wales Legislative Assembly and former member for the House of Representatives, Hon. Bruce Baird. Several reforms recommended by Mr Baird have already been implemented, including changes to registration fees and the establishment of an overseas student ombudsman. These bills being debated today are in response to Mr Baird's recommendations, primarily recomÂ­mendation 16 of his report. These bills will establish a single tuition protection service for all higher education providers listed on the Commonwealth Register of Institutions and Courses for Overseas Studentsâ€”CRICOS.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The Tuition Protection Service can be accessed by students to gain a refund on that part of their course which is not delivered in the event their higher education provider does not meet its refund obligations under the ESOS act. Students will only be eligible for a refund of the unused part of prepaid tuition fees. In other words, tuition for which the student has paid but which has not yet been delivered by the provider, rather than a full refund as was previously the case, in recognition that students may obtain credit for part of the study already completed.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The new scheme limits the collection of fees to no more than one study period in advance and requires providers who do not receive recurrent government funding to place all students' pre-paid course fees for their first study period into a designated account which can only be drawn down when the student begins study. In addition, these bills establish an online information service to allow students to select from suitable placement options in circumstances where their higher education provider does fold, and will establish national registration for providers operating in more than one jurisdiction.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">These bills were referred to both the House of Representatives and the Senate committees on education and employment. All stakeholders had an opportunity to comment and some common threads have emerged. The Australian Council of Private Education Providers, ACPEPâ€”the peak body for private higher education providersâ€”Universities Australia as well as the Group of Eight universities are all concerned about the rushed implementation of these forecast changes. They think the time frames are unrealistically short. But beyond the time frame for the changes, there are also specific concerns relating to cash flow issues, quantum of fees and the approach to risk.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The coalition shares some of these concerns so let me briefly touch upon them in greater detail. The time frames proposed by the government for implementing this significant suite of legislation does indeed seem very short. The coalition would have preferred to have a longer lead time to allow some providers more time to change their business model, which the new fee regime will necessitate. We are not talking about a minor or cosmetic change here. The quantum of fees that institutions will be able to collect upfront makes a huge difference to cashflow. If the quantum is reduced, as it is under the proposed legislation, institutions have to restructure the way they operate and do business. Clearly, this is not something that can be done overnight. The ESOS Act, as it currently stands, requires providers to give notification of default within 14 days. While the coalition acknowledges some of the problems the Department of Education, Employment and Workplace Relations outlined in evidence to the Senate committee with the current 14-day time frame, the opposition is not convinced that the proposed new 24-hour deadline is adequateâ€”though I have just been looking through the recently released proposed government amendments and I do notice that amendment (1) changes the government's proposal from 24 hours and substitutes that for three business days. Looking at that amendment here and now, it would seem that that amendment is far more preferable. So I think the government is on the right track. I should also remind the Senate that both the House and the Senate committees that looked at the legislation recommended that the notification period be 72 hours or three business days respectively. So I do think the government is on the right track.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The coalition acknowledges the diverse nature of the providers who will be affected by the changes envisaged in these bills and has some concern about the one-size-fits-all nature of the way in which student tuition fees may be dealt with. The legislative changes proposed allow operators to collect, in most circumstances, only a proportion of upfront course costs and for those fees to be placed into a designated account. Many providers argue that this scheme may result in a destabilisation of their existing business model. On the other hand, the department believes allowing providers to collect pre-paid fees 'encourages poor business practices'. We acknowledge that for some operators the department's view is probably the correct one but we believe the department has underestimated the great diversity of the international education sector. For that reason the coalition would have preferred a legislative scheme in which riskier operators are subjected to more regulation than less risky operators in order to reflect this great diversity.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The coalition will support this legislation, but we will, as we often doâ€”and as you have often heard me say in this placeâ€”monitor its implementation to ensure it achieves its policy objectives. We owe the international education sector nothing less.</span>

                      <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Senator RHIANNON</span>
                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">New South Wales</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">11:17</span>):  International students are significant for our education sector in terms of what they bring to our education communities and the commercial strength of our tertiary sector. We benefit from the rich social capital, knowledge, skills and diversity international students bring not only to our classrooms and campuses but also to our communities. Those students who stay after studying here keep directly contributing to our prosperity and wellbeing. Those students who return home provide links with the regions around us and assist to connect us to the rest of the world.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">International students are an important conduit for the flow of ideas, of personal and national relationships and obviously with investment and trade. Economically, overseas students studying in Australia poured some $16.3 billion into our economy last financial year. Education services are still our largest services export industry and Australia's third-largest export industry after iron ore and coal. International students generate demand for nearly 181,000 full-time equivalent employees and, with the short-sighted historic decline in public funding for higher education, now represent a substantial investment in our universities from which all Australian students profit.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I just mentioned the huge amounts of money international students bring in, and I think it is relevant to this debate that we note that this has decreased. Last year we saw a significant drop of 12.5 per cent in the international student income. That is actually a hefty $2.3 billion plunge from the 2010 high of $18.6 billion. So how we manage this sector is obviously vitally important.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">These bills before us, the Education Services for Overseas Students Legislation Amendment (Tuition Protection Service and Other Measures) Bill 2011, the Education Services for Overseas Students (Registration Charges) Amendment (Tuition Protection Service) Bill 2011 and the Education Services for Overseas Students (TPS Levies) Bill 2011, represent the latest in a line of legislation, beginning with the ESOS Act itself, seeking to strengthen protection of international students' interests. It is clear that there is a range of different approaches from the different parties represented in this parliament, but overall there is a commitment that protection needs to be in place. And the Greens certainly argue that the improvements are badly needed.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">It is relevant to this debate to remember the terrible assaults experienced by Indian students in 2009 and also the default of a number of private providers, which has brought real disgrace on the sector in many areas. I understand that 49 private providers defaulted in 2009 and this affected about 11,000 studentsâ€”and we know that it did severely damage Australia's reputation as a safe and welcoming country for overseas students. These problems have been compounded by some education agents and providers who in fact have misled students about courses, work opportunities and migration outcomes. This unethical behaviour has made it much more difficult, I believe, for Australia to present its best fact in an increasing sharp international competition. This competition is more and more attracting overseas students away from Australia. Again, it further underlines the need for this legislation.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Australia Education International has provided some very informative information for what we are considering here. Its September report showed that the perception of quality education as the most important factor for prospective students when choosing an international education destination. The same report showed Australia as ranking third out of five English-speaking competitor countries in perceived quality education. I would argue that that supports the Greens position for substantially more investment in our education systems.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">These bills are the second in the tranche of responses to the Baird review, tightening regulation around the industry and protecting students' interests, and so working to rebuild and safeguard Australia's reputation and own interests in this incredibly important sector.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I would like to go on to some of the details of the bills. I mentioned the defaulting of private providers during 2009 and 2010. Out of the total of 54 college closures in the last five years only 11 have provided any refunds at all to their overseas students. Overseas students have been paying substantial amounts of money upfront for their education. In 2010 the cost of default refunds and student replacement services was $11.5 million. That was up by $2.2 million from 2009.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">As of December 2010 there were 32 claims that were not finalised, and the government has been forced to subsidise the ESOS fund twice to cover unfunded student refunds. The centrepiece of these bills seeks to remove the risk of this happening again. Obviously, these are issues that are important for the reputation of the sector and there is also the issue of the financial burden that is put back on the public of Australia.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">A new universal tuition protection service, or TPS, will be the centrepiece here. When providers default on commencing or completing a course at a particular location for which students have paid, TPS will organise alternative course placements or student tuition fee refunds. The Greens are pleased to see that low-risk publicly funded institutions will be exempt from two of the levy components: the base fee and the risk rated components. I note that low-risk private providers may also apply for exemption from the same components.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">However, there is a major anomaly in calculating the TPS levy. The administrative fees are set at $100, plus $2 per enrolment for the previous year. The base fees are set at $200 plus $5 per enrolment for the previous year. I give emphasis to 'the previous year', but that is what this is all based on. Yet new providers seeking registrationâ€”and one could argue that they pose a higher risk of defaultâ€”are in effect exempted from the $2 and $5 per student components because they do not have a prior history of enrolments. This is where we have an extraordinary anomaly.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I argue that this is an absurd contradiction in risk assessment terms. New providers must already provide projected domestic and overseas student numbers with their application for CRICOS registration. I will move an amendment to the Education Services for Overseas Students Legislation Amendment (Tuition Protection Service and Other Measures) Bill<span style="font-weight:bold;"></span>to ensure that new providers are also charged per student, using their projected likely total enrolments to complete the calculation. This could actually also provide a check against overinflated claims of student numbers that new providers might be tempted to provide.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The overseas student tuition fund will also pay for placement services and the costs of TPS staff, its director and the boardâ€”which is intended to represent the different sectors of international education providers. Some in the sector have expressed concerns that there is no requirement in the bill to ensure that representation, so we are inserting an amendment that requires the seven non-department board members to represent providers from across the international education and training sector, including providers of ELICOS courses, which provide major pathways into further Australian studies for overseas students.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The amount of initial prepaid tuition fees a provider can collect from each student before the course starts will be limited to one study period of 24 weeks, and may not be more than 50 per cent of the total tuition fees for the course unless the total length of the course is less than 24 weeks. Thereafter, providers may not receive overseas tuition fees more than two weeks before study commences. This is to minimise the amount of refunds a defaulting provider may need to repay to students.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I fully appreciate that this is a logistical challenge for providers. However, we need to remember that last year calls on the ESOS Assurance Fund were an unsustainable 523 per cent higher than the year before, with some $11.5 million being drawn from that fund, which had to be topped up by the government twice. Clearly, it is not sustainable and something has to give. Let us not forget that last financial year the sector lost $3.2 billion in income compared with the previous year, and it is suffering for it. We have to take the hard steps to ensure that our international students' moneyâ€”and let us always remember that it is their moneyâ€”is protected and available to give back to the students when providers do not deliver what the students have paid handsomely for. Surely, that is something that we could all agree on.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">To that end, any initial prepaidâ€”that is, pre course commencementâ€”tuition fees should be kept in a designated prepaid fees account, which may only be drawn to a minimum balance of the unused fees as the course progresses. In the case of default, the unused portion of those fees can be transferred to an alternative course provider if the student accepts another placement, or the unused balance can be refunded to the student. State education providers and publicly funded universities are exempt from this requirement as low-risk providers, being effectively underwritten by the government, unlike private providers. However, regulations may exempt other such providers if they are determined to be similarly low risk. Moving on to the issue of accommodation, these provisions provide protection to overseas students by ensuring their unexpended tuition fees are available for refund should their education provider default on course provision. Clearly, this is incredibly important. However, there is nothing in these bills to protect students when they pay what are often substantial upfront accommodation fees to providers, and these can disappear with shonky providers and have done so. Some measure of protection surely belongs in this legislation. I am concerned that it was not in there from the very beginning. We will be amending these bills to afford prepaid accommodation fees the same protection as tuition fees, except in item 11, where providers will be able to draw down below the protected amount in order to make advance payments to accommodation suppliers, and may do so before a course commences.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We have also given attention to the issue of record keeping. Record-keeping requireÂ­ments, which obligate the confirmation and updating of written student contact details, academic progress and attendance records every six months, streamline student replacement or refunds in the case of default. It will provide another way of ensuring overseas students do not slip by unnoticed in the system, which is also the justification for the requirement to report any provider or student default within 24 hours.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">There has been some argument around the tightness of this reporting deadline, and I understand it has caused some logistical challenges for providers. The department has committed that the reporting system will be online and easy to reverse. However, there have been significant delays in cases where overseas students have gone missing, some in very serious circumstances, with overseas governments expressing grave concern. The duty of care for the welfare and safety of students remains paramount. Clearly, their friends and family need to feel confident that they are safe at all times and that, if there are problems, they will hear about them quickly. In many cases, foreign governments are also playing a role here and want to be confident. Again, it goes to the perception of how international students fare in our country with regard to the key issue of safety.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Providers must notify students if that provider defaults on the provision or completion of a course the student has paid for and must either organise for students to be placed in another similar course, if the student so chooses, or provide a refund of unexpended fees. The provider must then advise within seven days of how they have met those obligations. Conversely, in the case of student default, providers must have a written agreement with each overseas student or intending student setting out refund conditions in the case of student default. They must pay any refund due to the student under the agreement within four weeks of the student's claim unless the student did not pay outstanding payments, had their visa refused because they did not start the course on the agreed date or withdrew from the course at that location.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">There is a need for the national code to be updated, and for benchmarks and minimum standards for refund policies of providers to be instated, to ensure all students are entitled to consistent refund policies. That first requires consultation outside this legislative process. This is another small protection which does not yet exist but which these bills should afford a student. I look forward to the debate in the committee stage, because there is clearly room for improvement on these bills.</span>

A commitment to a long-term, high-quality international education sector is at the forefront of the Gillard government's priorities. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">It would come as no surprise to anyone in the broader community that this government is delivering a significant number of reforms to our education sector. These reforms are aimed at ensuring not only that all Australians get the best education but also that Australia's reputation as a provider of high-quality, first-class educational services in the international community is fulfilled. In last year's budget, Labor outlined $3 billion of additional investment in training to address skill shortages across the industry. This government is putting back into a number of industries that matter most to our nation, and through these vocational education and training reforms we will see, in the longer term, productivity growth in our economy.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">International education is one of Australia's most important industries. It is our third-largest export industry and annually provides revenue of more than $16.3 billion to the Australian government. Income generated in my home state of New South Wales by overseas education services amounted to $5.8 billion, or 37 per cent of export income from all onshore students, in 2010-11. In Victoria and Queensland, there was $4.8 billion and $2.5 billion respectively, while in other states the income from overseas students amounted to $2.6 billion. Of the total export income generated by education services, $15.8 billion was from spending on fees and goods and services by onshore students, and a further $595 million was earned through offshore and other educational activities. The international education sector in this country cannot be taken for granted. In recent times we have seen the effects that the high Australian dollar has had on the demand for placements of international students in Australia. And not only are the economic effects important; reputation is crucial to our nation's ability to attract international students and grow this important export market. That is why in 2009 the Prime Minister, in her then role as Minister for Education, asked Bruce Baird to conduct a review of the Education Services for Overseas Students Act and associated legislation. While the review was conducted the government moved to have the ESOS Act amended to require reregistration of all overseas student education providers to ensure ongoing integrity in this important industry. When the Baird report was released the government committed to a staged response to that review. April last year saw the enactment of the first stage of the government's response to the Baird review. Legislation soon followed in June to adjust the annual registration charge for cost recovery. This bill represents the government's fourth piece of legislation to strengthen the regulation of international education in Australia.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The government has already taken other significant steps towards creating a long-term future for international students in the higher education sector, including the establishment of a national regulator for the vocational education and training and higher education sectors and significant reforms to the student visa program. This bill will strengthen Australia's reputation as a high-quality education provider within the region and throughout the world. It does this by establishing a strong but fair regulatory regime for the provision of international education and training services. This ensures that the interests of overseas students are protected by establishing minimum standards and providing tuition and financial assurance for those overseas students. Also, the bill is designed to strengthen Australia's migration laws by ensuring providers collect and report information that is relevant to the administration of the law relating to student visas.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">As I said earlier, the education sector is of huge significance to the Australian economy. It is one of our largest export industries, generating about $16.3 billion a year for our economy. The sector is also very important when it comes to employment. It is responsible for about 125,000 jobs throughout the economy. The international education sector in Australia has also grown considerably in a relatively short period of timeâ€”from about 50,000 students at the beginning of the 1990s to more than 600,000 students now. Obviously this growth has led to an increased number of international students at our universities. Macquarie University, in the north of Sydney, has around 12,000 international places, Monash University has around 13,000 places and my old stomping ground the University of New South Wales also has around 13,000 places.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">On top of this we have also had a huge rise in the number of education providers for international students, particularly in the private sector. Significantly, there are now more than 1,200 providers in this sector. These huge numbers, and the relatively large increase in recent times, have caused pressures on the regulatory framework that underpins our international education sector. The Baird review focused on several major aspects of those pressures in the international education space. When the report was released in 2010 some of the key recommendations included strengthening the registration process; effective monitoring and enforcement provisions; empowering students with information about complaint handling; ethical recruitment; and stronger consumer protections for students.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">In early 2011 the government acted to bring in a wide range of reforms designed to give effective enforcement, to restrict processes around the registration of education providers and to give access to the ombudsman to allow students who attend private schools and private education providers to access a fair and balanced complaints facility. These changes were necessary at the time and they have created a framework for this second round of reforms. These bills will address many of those remaining recommendations contained in the Baird report.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Key to those reforms is the strengthening of tuition protections, and education providers who close their doors will no longer be able to take their students' money with them without some recourse. The reforms contained in these bills are also the government's response to a series of closures within the sector that have cost students a great deal of time, money and heartache to get refunds but have also done damage to Australia's reputation in the international community as a market for overseas students.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Closures affect not only the students but also our reputation throughout the world as a stable provider of services. The current system requires all non-exempt providers to belong to a tuition assurance scheme and pay into the ESOS Assurance Fund. This process involves separate applications and fees as a condition of CRICOS registration. Often the process means that the costs of placing affected students are not distributed throughout the industry in an equitable way.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The introduction of the Tuition Protection Service allows for a single point of placement for students and, in the worst cases, a refund for students. The TPS will allow for all possible placement options for students, placement incentives for providers and greater student choice. A single TPS means greater flexibility in service, a single entry point for students, a single set of fees for providers and, of course, greater accountability to government. The TPS will also mean providers who take on displaced students will receive the equivalent of an unexpended prepaid fee. This means the education providers and, importantly, the students are not out of pocket when these circumstances occur. If students do not meet the entry requirements of an education provider there is no obligation to admit the student; and for providers who are unable to pay any difference in fees that may be payable to take on a student there are no compulsory placements. The TPS will include student refunds for unspent portions of upfront fees paid to education providers. Under the current system, if an education provider closes in the final weeks of a student's study, the student is entitled to a full refund even if they obtain credit for completed units of study from another provider. These changes are about ensuring that we strengthen the framework of our approach to providing education services. The changes will provide greater integrity and greater security which will only bolster Australia's reputation as a provider of first-class international student services.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">In the past, growth was seen as the only objective; no thought was given to Australia's reputation as a global education supplier. Neither was any thought given to the welfare of students receiving the education nor, worst of all, to ensuring that their education was of a good standard. Growth in the overseas student education sector is fantastic for the Australian economy, and the creation of jobs servicing overseas students is of great importance to all of us. This bill is designed to ensure that growth in the industry continues and that we strengthen the reputations of the industries which are providing the services.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Let us take the example of a potential student from China, from where more than $4.1 billion of student related income comes into the Australian economy each year. That potential student will now be able to choose an Australian education provider and have confidence that their investment in the future will be secure. Another example is that of a potential student from India, from where more than $2 billion of student related income makes its way into the Australian economy each year. There are also potential students from Korea, Vietnam, Malaysia, Thailand, Indonesia, Nepal, Hong Kong and Saudi Arabia. The combined economic benefit to the Australian economy of the education of students from these countries is more than $4.8 billion. These students expect to come to Australia and receive an education of the highest calibre; this government has an obligation to protect those students and to ensure that the Australian education sector has the reputation it deservesâ€”and that is what these reforms will do.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Whether for Australian students or for international students, the Gillard government is delivering better education services in our economy which will provide the platform for better delivery of services as well as greater growth and greater strength in our economy. These are things that must be supported by the Senate.</span>

                    <a href="207825" type="MemberSpeech">
                      <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Senator McKENZIE</span>
                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Victoria</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">11:47</span>):  I too rise to comment on the Education Services for Overseas Students Legislation Amendment (Tuition Protection Service and Other Measures) Bill 2011 and associated bills. For the record, I acknowledge the many overseas students whose presence in our regional universities, TAFEs and colleges offers benefits to all Australian students as well as to our regional communities more generally. Only last week I participated quite vigorouslyâ€”though probably less vigorously than I had in the late 80sâ€”in the O-week celebration at Latrobe University in Bendigo. There I was able to see firsthand the social and cultural value of international students studying at our institutions as domestic and international students got to know each other through a range of social activities prior to commencing their university studies.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Australians are known to value the wealth of cultural diversity and social sophistication brought by international students to campuses and their associated communities. The internationalisation of Australian education provides people in all areas of Australia with the opportunity to learn about other cultures and languages. In addition, it provides Australia with a ready-made supply of future advocates in the best laboratories and the brightest boardrooms in countries right across the world. All overseas students need our recognition and our support.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">According to the ABS, during the last 20 years there has been strong growth in transnational education. There are more than 3 million tertiary students worldwide who are enrolled outside their country of residence. That is an increase of more than 200 per cent since 1985, when just under 1 million students travelled overseas to study. Since the 1980s Australia has become a major player in the international student market by offering globally recognised courses and qualifications. Australia's international students are currently our second largest group of temporary entrants. In 1990 Australia welcomed 47,000 international students to our shores; by 2004, Australia attracted six per cent of all tertiary students enrolled outside their country of residence and was the fifth most popular destination for overseas students. Already by the year 2000 the number of international students had grown to 153,000. In 2005, overseas students represented approximately 18 per cent of all higher education students. In 2010, we welcomed more than 619,000 international students to universities, TAFE colleges and schools throughout Australia.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">So the provision of education services to full-fee-paying overseas students is an important industry for the Australian economy, and many of the senators who have been commenting on this bill have made reference to that fact. Education services provided in Australia to international students were valued at over $9 billion in export earnings in the financial year 2004-05. At the time, it was the fourth-highest-earning export industry for Australia: in total, it generated more revenue than either wool, wheat or beef. Today, according to the Commonwealth government's Department of Education, Employment and Workplace Relations, education services are Australia's third-largest export industry behind coal and iron oreâ€”that is saying somethingâ€”and the largest service export industry, ahead of personal travel services.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Full-fee-paying overseas students are therefore an important revenue source for Australian universities. In 2005, revenue from full-fee-paying overseas students represented 15 per cent of all revenue within the higher education sector, which is a significant proportion. As universities work towards delivering quality educational infrastructure right around our nation, it is important that they are well funded. By 2008, the Australian overseas student industry contributed $15 billion in export income to the Australian economy from spending on fees and goods. The latest comparable ABS estimate, which is for the year 2008-09, is $16.6 billion. Universities Australia, the peak body representing Australian universities, states that education exports are the clear No. 1 service export ahead of tourism. As well as being an important revenue source, overseas enrolments can help educational institutions reach the critical mass needed to diversify the range of educational programs on offer to all students. The international student population growth has led to significant expansion in the number of education providers offering services, particularly in the private vocational education and training space. There are now more than 1,200 providers ranging from large universities and TAFEs and public and private schools to small private colleges and English language providers, many in regional centres throughout Australia. Together this has resulted in pressures on the underpinning regulatory frameworks, exacerbated by external factors such as global economies and the increasing value of the Australian dollar.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The background to the more current problems facing international education in Australia is by now well known. Reputational damage associated with provider closures has affected all providers in the international education sector, and this has needed to be addressed. In my own home state of Victoria this was particularly the case. I have first-hand experience of this and it is great to see both institutions and jurisdictions working hard to repair the damage.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">One of the issues highlighted through the recent provider closures was the ability to gain a national picture of education providers to determine how many students were going to be affected. Current figures indicate that approximately 230 providers operate across sectors and jurisdictions, contributing to a disjointed system for these providers in that they experience different processes and charges in each jurisdiction, and different initial and annual registration charges at the Commonwealth level. There may also be a duplication in registration assessments which are more global to the organisation rather than local to the course being delivered at a particular campus. Only 11 of the 54 providers that closed between 2008 and the end of March 2011 met or partially met their refund obligation to students. That would significantly play into the reputation of our Australian providers in this area, the issue obviously being that the international studentsâ€”all 11,000 of themâ€”are the ones left holding the can.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The Education Services for Overseas Students Legislation Amendment (Tuition Protection Service and Other Measures) Bill is part of a package of three bills to establish a tuition protection service for all our overseas students. The bill amends the Education Services for Overseas Students Act 2000 and places obligations on registered international education providers when a provider fails to start or finish providing a course or when the overseas student fails to start or finish a course. It also provides for a national regime of national registration of providers. It limits the amount of initial prepaid fees that may be collected by a registered provider and it provides that students are only eligible for a refund of the unused portion of prepaid tuition fees and specifies what details must be kept on student records.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">In summary, the implementation of a new universal single-layer TPS framework will place students more effectively into the Australian tertiary education sector. It will limit refunds, remove unnecessary administrative layers and fees, and draw from a greater pool of available places in the education sector, with incentives for providers to place students. It will enable greater student choice and responsibility as well as direct contact with potential new education providers. It will also provide for transparent decision making and fee setting that better targets provider risks and ensures sufficient funds are collected from the sector to meet fluctuating requirements related to the risk of future provider default. We obviously appreciate greater transparency in this area. The changes will also complement Australia's migration laws by ensuring providers collect and report information relevant to the administration of the law relating to student visas. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">As I examine the detail, I want to comment on one of the issues raisedâ€”that of prepaid fees. Providers will be limited to the amount of prepaid fees they can collect at any one time to no more than 50 per cent of the total tuition fees before the student has begun the course. The current ESOS provisions have no restrictions on prepaid fees, with students possibly paying 100 per cent of tuition fees, sometimes before a student visa is approved. While many providers take no more than one study period fees at a time, this amendment is designed to help reduce the liability to businesses by limiting the size of refunds owed to students and reduce any potential refunds.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The changes also propose to restrict a provider from collecting student tuition fees not more than two weeks before the commencement of a course. Stakeholders have regarded this restriction as impractical. The Council of Private Higher Education suggests the period should be extended to four weeks while the public university sector wants no time frame when a university can accept prepaid fees. All but the low-risk providers will also have to keep initial prepaid fees in a designated account until the student commences their first study period. Whilst the requirements do not apply to low-risk providers such as universities who receive Commonwealth funding and providers administered by the state education authority, they will apply to many smaller private universities, colleges and schools who are similarly low-risk providers and have quite strong reputations in the sector.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The Department of Employment, Education and Workplace Relations argues that the proposed changes will ensure providers are able to meet their refund requirements should the provider default or the student visa application be refused and will assist and encourage sustainable business practices. However, one-size policy solutions rarely result in a seamless implementation across a sector or an industry, so there is a bit of wait-and-see on this one. The change is designed to stop providers from using prepaid fees for operating expenses before the student commences, despite the fact that a lot of operating expenses in order to start teaching a student actually occur before they have to rock up on day one of classes and encourage more sustainable business models. Penalties have been recommended for non-compliance and for the misuse of prepaid fees. It is reasonable that if a provider defaults and fails to provide a course at an agreed location or a course does not start on an agreed date, then the student should be reimbursed. However, there needs to be some recognition of those providers with strong reputations such as the Holmes Institute, which has been operating for many years in this sector and offering a range of programs to international students, and similar low-risk providers who will be caught in these hasty policy implementations. Whilst it will protect Australia's reputation for delivering quality education services, it will mean that all providers are able to meet their student refund obligations in a timely way. This will obviously impact on the financial operations of the business and many institutions. I have reservations concerning the impact of this legislation on regional universities, TAFE colleges and boarding schoolsâ€”all smaller institutions than the likes of Melbourne, Sydney or Monash universities. Invariably the most expensive two months of any year occur when the curriculum is being prepared, the teachers are gearing up and the equipment is being purchasedâ€”the charge will prove a challenging cashflow issue.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I recognise that the focus is on better managing risk upfront and throughout a provider's registration and that these need a legislative framework to provide security and support for all our overseas students. At the same time we must also ensure that the financial operations of all our educational providers is protected and a variety of educational providers is available in all areas of Australia. While international students provide welcome financial input into our tertiary sector and are a rich addition to the cultural and social experience for Australian students studying alongside them, it is incumbent on legislators and regulators to ensure that our higher education sector remains world-class. We have a responsibility to all students studying in Australia to ensure that they have a high quality educational standard. We also need to guard our reputation abroad as a destination of choice for the world's brightest. Financially, educationally and socially the experience of our international students needs to be positive, transparent and rewarding. There are challenges on these fronts, which universities, governments and communities are addressing. This legislation, based on the Baird review recommendations, goes towards addressing these concerns.</span>

                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Western Australia</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">12:02</span>):  I rise also to contribute to the debate on the Education Services for Overseas Students Legislation Amendment (Tuition Protection Service and Other Measures) Bill 2011 and cognate bills, and to affirm the comments of my colleaguesâ€”that is, the critical importance of overseas student education to this country, particularly in the Asian region. I am very pleased to acknowledge visitors in the public gallery who come from the very regions where we are hosting and, in some cases, receiving higher education. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">People must not overlook or dismiss the importance of overseas student education to the Australian economy, to our foreign affairs and to the long-term wellbeing of our relationships in the region. We are pleased to have a circumstance in which the export income to this country from the overseas higher education sector is now the third highest in the nation and it is the highest service based export income earner for Australia. This is undervalued by most Australians. It is not understood by most Australians, and it needs to be far more deeply seated into the psyche of our community. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The benefit for us is not just when the students are here; there is also the long-term benefit that comes from them having studied in this country. In 2009 I had the pleasure of giving the occasional address at Edith Cowan University in Perth, where I was informed that one-third of the graduands in front of me that day were from overseas. I think back too to the occasion in 2004 when the company that I then ran opened an office in Manila in the Philippines. There was a Filipino businessman who could not have been more helpful to us in opening doors and in introducing us to people in government and in the business sector. At a function at the ambassador's home, I asked him: 'Why are you giving us so much assistance? Why are you so keen to see our company here?' He said: 'Because I got my opportunity during the Colombo Plan back in the 1950s. I studied at the University of Western Australia. It was an opportunity that would otherwise have been denied me and I have never forgotten it. I have never ever wasted an opportunity to be able to join with Australian companies and government in trying to advance their interests.'</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I urge my colleagues and the wider community to understand and realise that as we move more into the Asian region, politically, diplomatically, militarily and economically, we have an enormous resource in the graduates and alumni of our Australian institutionsâ€”those who have come from overseas to study here and those who go back to their countries and who, hopefully, think well of their Australian experience. We should be building on that: we should be maintaining contact with the alumni and we should be using them as they move into senior positions in business, commerce and government. We should be using those links all the more into the future. That is why this legislation is so important. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">It has been mentioned by others that the income to this country from overseas students is now in the order of some $16.3 billion. It has been as high as $25 billion annually, and I want to explore for a few moments the reasons for its decline. Referring back to an earlier age, when I was engaged in business activities in India in the early part of the last decade, I remember reading and then discussing with our Australian consul in Mumbai the widely-publicised fact that Australia had passed the United Kingdom and was second only to America as a location popular with Indian students wanting to study overseas and gain overseas qualifications. I was very proud as an Australian and as one who had been on the faculty of the Curtin University in Western Australia, another university that has long had an association with overseas students and relies heavily on the income from full-fee-paying overseas students. I ask: why is it that we have gone down on the list? We would be no closer now than probably fourth or fifth. Yes, currency fluctuations and the high Australian dollar are points. Others have obviously alluded to the unfortunate publicity that occurred as service providers failed, as overseas students were left here helpless and, regrettably, as some students from overseas countries, particularly in this case India, seem to have been the subject of attacks, particularly in Melbourne. I made it my business to inquire about the background and the basis of that and I am absolutely satisfied that there was no deliberate attempt to target Indian students as such. What came home to me is the fact that those who arrive on our shores need some form of orientationâ€”to be aware that you do not get on a train late at night with a laptop computer and the sorts of objects that others might want to steal from you, or they might cause physical damage to you. I am sure that we have seen that overcome.</span>

                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Unfortunately, also evident to us when we undertook the hearings on this particular matter under the chairmanship of Senator Marshall in the Senate Education, EmployÂ­ment and Workplace Relations Legislation Committee was the lack of consultation prior to decisions being taken. I learnt that recently from vice-chancellors; we have certainly learnt it from other registered training providers. If there is one lesson that we all want to get out of this process it is that we must engageâ€”government must engage and departmental senior officers must engage with all of the players before we make precipitous decisions. We had a circumÂ­stance in which overseas students were coming to this country and enrolling in spurious coursesâ€”hairdressing and cooking type coursesâ€”with the expectation, often driven by agents in their home countries, that this was an easy path to Australian residency, ongoing to Australian citizenship. Those are the sorts of issues we should have foreseen and we should have put measures in place to prevent them happening.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We all know very well that overseas agents and, in some cases, Australian providers are only too willing to see the short-term benefit and ignore the long-term loss and the long-term damage that they cause by building up expectations that can never be realised. From this side of the chamber to the government side of the chamber, if we can work constructively to put those sorts of activities behind us we will be all the better for it.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The figures are interesting. A previous speaker mentioned that 125,000 full-time equivalent positions were generated here in Australia for service providers to provide educational services for overseas studentsâ€”a very impressive figure. When we saw the downturn, unfortunately the dramatic loss of those positions was also reported to us. What is equally interesting to me is that, of the 380,000 students who had student visas, the average number of family member visits per student was 1.8 last year. If my calculations are correct, somewhere approaching 700,000 visitors come to this country who would not have come had their relative not been studying here. Again, that is something which we should surely be encouraging. I would be very interested to learn from tourism authorities and others about what the yield might have been. How high spending were those overseas visitors who came directly as a result of their student relative being here?</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Of course, that 380,000 student figure is low because it only includes those on student visas. When you add in short-term, English-as-a-second-language students who come here on tourist visas, we would see that number of students, with the multiplier effect, dramatically increased. Those of us who have had sons or daughters overseas on Rotary exchange or similar types of programs always seem to find an opportunity to visit them when we otherwise would not have gone there. We all know the attraction and the power that accompanies these sorts of visits, and we would often see a multiplier effect with the visitors going back to their home country, speaking well of Australia, speaking well of their relative's experience here and generating others to come.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">It is interesting to listen to the evidence, particularly from those who were providing short-term training, especially in the English language. For example, English Australia advised us that the number of students under the umbrella that they represented had decreased from 219,000 in 2008 to 122,000 in 2011. The number had almost halved in that three-year period. That has a dramatic effect on employment, service provision and the jobs of those who would have been providing the service. It is also interesting that there was a 30 per cent decline in the number coming from China for short-term courses in the English language, a 40 per cent decline in those coming from Thailand and a 50 per cent decline in those coming from Vietnamâ€”some of the very markets that we want to promote to. I go back to tourism. Naturally enough, in terms of yield, in terms of dollars left and dollars investedâ€”not in terms of numbers yetâ€”we know that China has become the highest contributor to offshore tourism to this country. We should not overlook those opportunities.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Recommendations were put forward to the department and onwards to the government, especially when it came to questions about prepayment fees. I thought very good suggestions were put forward by those organisations. They said that we are now in stiff competition with service providers from other countries and that we do not want to put into place legislation that would make it so unnecessarily onerous for those wanting to come to Australia that they look to other countries. We would simply be denying ourselves the opportunity.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">It was put to us that representatives support the intent of the legislationâ€”and I am quoting here from correspondence to meâ€”'to ensure that fees are utilised for the study period for which they are collected' and that 'the proposed legislation proposes two broad mechanisms to achieve it: firstly, depositing funds into a nominated account and drawing it down; andâ€”not or; andâ€”secondly, putting a limit on collection of no more than six months or 50 per cent of the fees themselves'. These people made the point eloquently that the objectives would be served by either one of those two but that the administrative burden of having to comply with the two of them was certainly unnecessary. They said it would be expensive and it would be confusing for the overseas students. So I still ask that the government give consideration to what have been very reasonable submissions from them.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">If nominating an account and drawing it down was not enough, they would strongly recommend that legislation to limit fee collection to no more than two weeks prior to the course commencing be abolished entirely or extended to a minimum of six weeks. The point they were making is that, in a very short course, the confusion associated with having to break the payment into two, the administration associated with collecting the funds a second time and the inconvenience to those who are supporting overseas students in having to make two payments rather than one is simply unnecessary.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">If ever there was an instance in which a risk management approach should be taken to this whole question, then the funding for and protection of overseas students as part of their education is a prime example. I am interested in knowing the sort of risk analysis that was done on those service providers who failed. I am interested in knowing, for example, the status and structure of those which failed. Were they the university sector? Were they the publicly owned TAFE sector? Were they long-established Australian companies? Were they long-established Australian private providers? Were they substantially overseas companies or organisations that had come into Australia to take advantage of this burgeoning demand?</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Until we know the background of those who failedâ€”of those who failed their students, of those who took money and ran with itâ€”I do not believe we can introduce legislation that is a catch-all for all purposes. For example, do we think for one minute that any one of the 28 or 29 universities in this country are going to close up shop and run away with overseas student money? The answer is patently no. Do we think that would happen with state owned, run and managed TAFEs or their equivalent? The answer is no. Therefore, it is critically important that we apply legislation on the basis of risk, and where there is no risk or low risk then the legislation should reflect that. We have many analogies. We have the capacity to put funds into escrow. We have the capacity to place a bond on a new provider if we perceive there is a risk associated with their capacity or willingness to deliver on what they are charging and claiming. I do not yet see that we have this approach.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I see we have a sledgehammer to kill a nut. I see we have a one-size-fits-all approach. I do not think this is the way to go. I do not believe we get the best when we penalise those for whom there is no risk associated with the activity, function or legislation under which they will be caught. I made this point to the department, I made it in the hearing itself: we must be much more forensic, if that is the term, in identifying where the risk lies and in applying treatments to that risk to ensure that we minimise or negate it. If it does not exist, do not impose the penalty or imposition in the first place. Witnesses before us and submissions placed before us from the various service providers made that point.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">On the point of competition, Australia has a great track record of 'aid, trade and fade'. If time permitted I could go through industry after industry where we have provided aid throughout regions of interest to us, that has led to trade and, for various reasons, we have faded. I make the plea that we do not fade. But, in so doing, I also make the point that it is such a lucrative opportunity that it is not just this country that has that opportunity, it is countries throughout Asiaâ€”the Philippines, for instance. Our universities have campuses in Singapore, Malaysia and other countries, and increasingly now in the Middle East, in the United Arab Emirates et cetera. So let us not think for a minuteâ€”arrogantlyâ€”that we are the only country capable of providing these educational services.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">There are two things I do not want to see happening: firstly, our own service providers shifting offshore because they cannotâ€”or do not want to and do not believe they need toâ€”comply with restrictive legislation here and move offshore to locations where they do not have these levels of governance and insistence but can still equally and safely provide the education; and, secondly, our being disadvantaged as a result of overseas service providers setting up and taking the very market that we are building a reputation for and in which we have enormous capacity for growth.</span>

                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">

                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">South Australia</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">12:22</span>):  I will first reflect on some of the comments made by Senator Back in his comprehensive contribution on this package of education services for overseas students legislation, not so much on points of difference but on matters that need to be sorted out in the committee stage. There is no doubt there is unanimity in this place about the importance of the overseas student sector. It is a significant part of Australia's economy. In my home state of South Australia it is one of the biggest export earners. South Australia is better as an economy and as a community because of the overseas student sector. It would be fair during the committee stage to explore the concerns around risk raised by Senator Back and others in the coalition. My understanding, as I read the bill, is that all but the lowest risk providers will have to keep prepaid fees in a designated account for the first study period. There is an element in the report of the Senate Standing Committee on Education, Employment and Workplace Relations that relates to risk that ought to be explored. The committee inquiry was very ably chaired by Senator Gavin Marshall and the deputy chair, Senator Back. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We not only need to strike a balance between ensuring that we do not have so much red tape that it becomes an onerous burden on educational institutions but also need to have some security, some sense of guarantee, for those overseas students who sign up for these courses that they will be able to pay those fees with the security that if anything does go wrong with an education provider they will not be out of pocket. That is the very important policy balance that needs to be obtained.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Let us put this in perspective. This is a major sector which is very important to Australia's economy and very important to my home state of South Australia. I have spoken in the past about my concerns for the overseas student sector in Australia and how we slipped back for a whole range of reasons. One of the big challenges we now have is a very strong Australian dollar, which is making us less competitive in the overseas student sector. The government needs to be congratulated for the action it has taken so far. The Baird review was a positive review that looked at a whole range of issues to comprehensively deal with these problems. The fact that Mr Bruce Baird AM was a former senior coalition politician indicates that the government has tackled this issue in a bipartisan fashion, and that is a good thing.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">In my home state of South Australia, overseas students make up nearly 10 per cent of the state's total exports compared to between seven and eight per cent nationally. That is why I have a vested interest, if you like, on behalf of my constituents to make sure we get this right. Unfortunately, some unscrupulous education providers have taken advantage of the strong growth in this sector to make a quick buck. In 2009 and 2010 we heard story after story of students who had come to Australia only to find the course was not what they paid for and, in some cases, the course and the provider no longer existed. There were also distressing stories of students forced to undertake long hours of physical labour in exchange for minimal education. This, coupled with disturbing accounts of isolated attacks against overseas students, even though they were universally condemned, began to reduce confidence in the sector. The overhaul of provider standards and regulations along with the establishment of an overseas students ombudsman have finally begun to pay off with improved standards and increased confidence for providers and students alike.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I note the work the government has done in implementing the Baird review, and this package of legislation is a part of that. The Australian overseas student education sector is much stronger as a result of these changes, and I support the government's intentions in these bills. I also support the government's amendments to these bills, which are in line with the recommendations made by the committee.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I will be moving againâ€”I hope it is a case of third time luckyâ€”amendments to the Education Services for Overseas Students Legislation Amendment (Tuition Protection Service and Other Measures) Bill 2011 and I will discuss these in more detail during the committee stage. In brief, my amendment simply gives the minister the discretionary power to make payments to overseas students to cover incidental costs such as travel or accommodation where a provider has failed to deliver the services as promised. It is a discretion for the minister that I think can be exercised in a way and in a manner that could enhance confidence in the sector. These payments could only be made after consultation with the Director of the Tuition Protection Service and if they do not put the TPS in financial difficulty. I am trying to get that blend of ensuring that it strengthens the sector and also ties it back to fiscal responsibility. These measures are sensible and straightforward and have appropriate safeguards in place to ensure that they do not place an excessive burden on the scheme.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I support these bills. I think it is fair, though, that some of the concerns raised by Senator Back and other coalition senators in their additional comments to the committee report be addressed. As I see it, we need to strengthen support and confidence in the sector. That will involve some costs, but the benefits of that will be to have more overseas students coming to Australia knowing with greater confidence that they will be protected from unscrupulous operators, the very small minority that taint the sector. The measures in this bill are a positive step.</span>

I will not delay the chamber too long in summing up other than to say that this is the final response to the Baird review, which I think has been a very good process designed to address some of the issues which were exposed in terms of the management and support for overseas students studying in Australia. I congratulate Mr Bruce Baird on the role he has played.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I also thank all those who contributed to the debate around these bills. We have listened to the sector and their concerns, but there is one overriding objective in all of this, which I continue to stress: this is a competitive international industry. Brand Australia is really important in this debate. For every closure of a college or every student who is treated poorly, the impact is felt around the world in terms of Australia's reputation. It does not matter whether it is the small cooking college in Melbourne or the Australian National University; a poor experience for someone in the small cooking college in Melbourne impacts on the ANU and every other university and college that is out there marketing its services as part of Australian international education.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">So it is very important that we get this right. It is very important that we provide as much protection and support for those international students and the sector as possible. That is done by making sure we have a very rigorous regulatory environment which supports the sector, supports its capacity, supports its responsiveness to the needs of students and ensures that we continue to support a really strong international reputation for our international education sector.</span>

We think these suggestions, made and picked up by the Senate committee inquiry, are good ones and so we will be moving amendments to support the approach that was recommended in that report.</span>

I think it reflects the additional comments of the coalition senators. It is a genuine question based on the coalition's concerns in saying that this is a one-size-fits-all approach. I think that Senator Back said that for a university, one of the Group of Eight, or a state-run TAFE, the risks involved of anything going wrong with that institution are practically non-existent or negligible compared with, say, a private institution of the sort that have collapsed. My understanding is that the issue of risk is factored into the legislation in considering the regulatory burden. I just want that clarified, because it seemed to be the main criticism, as I understood it, from the coalition. I am just trying to establish whether issues of risk are greater. There was a gradation of issues of risk in determining the regulatory compliance.</span>

We decided to go down that path. That was what was recommended. We thought it was the best way to approach the issue. There were a lot of discussions in the sector about that, rather than trying to split off different sections and having different systems apply to them. There was some initial resistance to that, but I think most people came on board and understood that.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">It is based on risk assessmentâ€”that is trueâ€”but I make the general point that I disagree with Senator Back in one regard. I think it is true to say that the universities are enacted by state legislation and they are much more secure than some of the other providers in the sector. That is the case, but I would not want to pretend that we have not had concerns about the university sector in Australia, that there were not a number of universities whose practices were of concern. I have certainly raised it directly with them, and a number of them are addressing those things. They are addressing them in terms of the Knight review response as well. It is equally true that not all the TAFEs have been, in my view, perfect citizens in this regard. So I just want to dispel the myth that somehow all of the concerns across the sector and how we deal with international students were centred on private colleges. I think I had a reputation for going pretty hard at some of the cooking college and hairdresser sector of the market as immigration minister. It needed to be cleaned up, and it has been. We have to be wary, but it is equally true that we need universities and TAFEs to provide first-class education services and proper supportive services for students. I am not one who believes 'university good, private college bad' or 'TAFE good, private college bad'. I think it is a much more complex set of circumstances than that. I think it is important that we have a universal system. But it is, as you say, important that, as we have done in response to the Knight review, we try to risk-rate what we are dealing with.</span>

I think it is fair to say that they generally reflect the findings of both the House of Representatives and Senate committees. We will discuss them in a moment, but I just want to thank you for that. I think that has moved the debate on considerably this afternoon, and I want to thank you. There was an issue raised in the Senate committee by several witnesses about the level of consultation by the department with many of the stakeholders, and we addressed this in the committee hearing in Melbourne. Can I just relay that concern and ask you, Minister, whether you are happy with the level of consultation. If you are not particularly happy, will we see improvements next time and how will that be done?</span>

There is obviously ongoing consultation. I myself have met with many providers. I had one of them in my room just before we came into the chamber, so I see providers all the time. Obviously, once we pass the legislation, the department will conduct information sessions for providers to explain the changes in detail. I have no reason to be critical of the department's consultative processes, but I am happy to take those up and make further inquiries. I did not realise that the criticisms were as strong as you indicate. Certainly the whole approach to this has been based on this being something that impacts on the sector and that they have to manage, so the whole thing has been about trying to get the sector to a place where, if not everyone is happy, at least they accept the legitimacy of it and accept that it is a broadly appropriate response to dealing with the problem. As I say, we very much followed the Baird-recommended approach. But I will have a look at the question you raise and seek my own feedback to see whether that concern is justified. I heard some initial rumblings, but they were more about whether or not they agreed that some of the universities were reluctant to be put into a universal scheme et cetera. But I will take on board your concern and make my own inquiries. That is the best I can do at this stage.</span>

I am just relaying that, if I might. On the cost of the new scheme, again there was concern expressed that some of the small independent schoolsâ€”with, let us say, fewer than 50 overseas studentsâ€”may not continue to maintain their CRICOS registration as a result of these changes. Is that of concern?</span>

We understand that schools will continue to recruit in that way, and we do not think the TPS arrangements are onerous for them. But certainly there has been no indication to us that somehow this is going to drive change in the sector.</span>

You would be aware, Minister, that this has been a constant issue with respect to these reforms. With respect to the default provisions in the legislation and the time frames, has the government discovered that stakeholders are concerned about the time frames? Many of them, in fact, say this is a significant increase in regulatory burden. Of all the concernsâ€”indeed, the complaintsâ€”expressed at the Melbourne hearing, I think it is fair to say that the time frames were the most significant, the most broadly expressed and perhaps the most virulent criticism of the legislation.</span>

Quite frankly, we have not responded in the same way as some would ask us to because there is the integrity of the system to protect. It is important, and this is why we are doing this. I think that one of our amendments goes a bit further than the committee recommended in terms of the timeâ€”it went from three days to five, I think. So we are trying to pick up what is reasonable without undermining the integrity of the system.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">In terms of the commencement provisions, I think people have had a pretty strong warning about what was about to occur. Obviously they have had the Baird report since March 2010, and the bills have been in the parliament since September 2011. The first TPS levy, which has the most significant impact for providers, will not be imposed until 2013. I do not accept some of the wild claims made about the onerous nature of administrative costs. There is no doubt that there are requirements on providers, but I make no apologies: if you are going to have a system which provides protections, you have to make sure that people actually provide a framework that allows us to do that.</span>

                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Senator SINGH</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Tasmania</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">12:45</span>):  Over the last six months Tasmanians have opened their hearts to men seeking asylum at the temporary immigration detention facility at Pontville in southern Tasmania. Despite attempts at fearmongering and whipping up moral panic by the Leader of the Opposition in the Senate, the Pontville Immigration Detention Centre has been embraced by Tasmanians, so much so that in recent weeks there has been a groundswell of support from the Mayor of Brighton, Tony Foster OAM, the Tasmanian government, including Premier Lara Giddings, support organisations and locals, who see the presence of the centre in their community as an opportunity rather than a threat. There can be no doubt that at the end of its six months in operation, Pontville has been a success and its impact on the local area overwhelmingly positive.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Not only is the Pontville centre safe and secure, but it is also supported by the outstanding Brighton community. In the months in which it has been open, the centre has become a focal point for national and local service providers, community organisations and volunteers, who have dedicated themselves to compassionate care and support to the asylum seekers. And there is no doubt that the great cooperation between the Department of Immigration and Citizenship and service organisations has assisted in the rapid processing of visa applications.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Tasmanians have reached out to these men, many of whom depend on the companionship of volunteer buddies to ease them through the trying time while their claims are being assessed and, in doing so, made that process smoother than it might otherwise have been. In these six months, almost 400 men housed at Pontville have already been released on permanent or bridging visas or into community detention. There remain currently 262 men in the Pontville Immigration Detention Centre. The large majority of these asylum seekers will be released into the community on permanent or bridging visas or released into community detention. I have been assured that the Department of Immigration and Citizenship is working as hard as it can to enable the greatest number of asylum seekers to be released from Pontville over the next month before the centre closes. A small group of asylum seekers will be relocated over the next month as their applications are still being processed.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">On 16 February 2012, the Minister for Immigration and Citizenship, Minister Chris Bowen, reiterated his commitment that the Pontville Immigration Detention Centre will close. It is my belief that the proximity of the Pontville centre to Brighton and to Hobart has been critical to facilitating volunteer support, and I am encouraged that the men still being assessed will be relocated to immigration centres located near capital cities.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I would also take this opportunity to impress upon this chamber that the centre at Pontville was not only a model of detention that was mindful of the needs and care that ought to be accorded asylum seekers but also a model that was effective. I want to acknowledge the role of the facility's DIAC manager, Dean Hulme; SERCO manager Andy Senior; and the staff who all approached a challenging situation with good planning and respect for the needs of the centre's occupants. Though I understand the minister's commitment to close Pontville, I hope that this model can be replicated in other detention centres and the building's facilities at Pontville are maintained against the possibility that they may be required again in the future.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Naturally, all of us in this chamber hope for an orderly and regular refugee migration systemâ€”and one from an ever-decreasing pool of global refugees. But if we should be required to accommodate irregular migration on the basis of our international commitments then let us follow the lead of the Brighton community and do so with open arms. Let us be as the volunteers in that community and the people calling for this centre to stay open, and stand ready with the generosity and care that that community has demonstrated.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Alongside staff-run programs, the volunteer support has been able to provide activities that accelerate and ease the transition of asylum seekers into the community and make the time necessary for assessment useful. Those activities have included a range of English and Arabic language classes, driving lessons, world news updates, visits to iconic areas, gardening and yoga. In many cases, the volunteer programs have not just been about acclimatising asylum seekers to their new Australian environment; they have also been about sharing the skills, knowledge and experiences of asylum seekers with localsâ€”providing a real opportunity to foster the kind of understanding and connection that is necessary to bind a community together outside the walls of detention.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">One particular story, I think, captures the spirit of these relationships. The Brighton Knitting Club welcomed the asylum seekers by dedicating their time to knit beanies and other clothing in all sorts of colours for the men in the centre, cognisant of the newness of Tasmania's colder climate to the mainly Afghani asylum seekers. But a number of women went further, visiting the centre with knitting needles in hand, prepared to teach the men how to supplement the clothes they had been provided. They were surprised, and pleased, to discover that the Hazara occupants of the centre were already skilled at knitting, many having made their livelihoods with similar skills in making and weaving carpets. In the regular visits to follow, the men and women swapped skills at the same time as they swapped stories. There is little greater example, I think, of multiculturalism in action than people of totally different backgrounds and experiences bonding over the interests and activities that they share, each teaching the other a new ability and a new empathy.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">It was a belief in these things that led Emily Conolan to harness the enthusiasm of the Tasmanian community and establish Tasmanian Asylum Seekers Support. Shortly after announcing the purpose of the group, Emily was overwhelmed by the number of people who wanted to be part of a constructive engagement with Australia's humanitarian immigration program. Over 150 volunteers have visited asylum seekers on a regular basis through the kind of coordinated activities about which I have spoken. Some have worked one on one with an asylum seeker to provide direct company and support. Each of those people deserves thanksâ€”not just for their compassion but also for their preparedness to look past the barriers, the physical walls, the trepidation of the unexpected and the cultural differences that too often prevent us from genuinely engaging with others. Their support has helped to make Pontville a more hopeful place. And of course Emily deserves thanks for seizing the initiative that has made such a positive experience possible.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">There is bipartisan consensus on the need for thorough immigration processing, including a period of mandatory detention. But we must always remember that the object of an orderly immigration program is not only to protect the Australian community but also to provide refuge to those seeking safety. The vast majority of people who seek asylum in Australia are those who have a well-founded fear of persecution in their country of origin. For one reason or another, their very identityâ€”their ethnicity, their beliefs or sexualityâ€”make them unwelcome in their home countries. They have made the decision to uproot their lives because they face violence, intimidation and discrimination, without recourse to the laws we in Australia take for granted.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The stories of most asylum seekers are stories of fear. For them, Australia is exactly the lucky country of which its people are so proud. Asylum seekers come to our shores by whatever means they can in search of the freedoms, opportunities and rights that make us the liberal democracy we are. Through a storm of danger and desperation, Australia is the first safe harbour in which refugees are permitted to be themselves. In Australia, every person is protected by the law and by the social contract that is so deeply a part of our community, no matter the person's background or identity. Those who violate that contract by breaking the law surrender some of its benefits, such as liberty. But those who seek refuge from lawlessness or from violations of the universal laws of human dignity must be protected by our contract. They must have access to the protections of our society and the security and safety that implies. Such protections are the seeds of possibility. They offer the chance to make a life inspired by optimism rather than by apprehension. They offer hope.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">During the years of coalition government from 1996 to 2007, Australia's immigration detention regime had the effect of systematically crushing the hope of refugees that they would ever have the chance to begin a new life. Under the Howard government, families with young children were kept behind razor wire for years on end. Some were released into the community with papers known as temporary protection visas, under which genuine refugees were required to constantly reapply to remain in Australia or be forced to return to the country in which they had suffered persecution. Under the so-called Pacific solution, other refugees were sent to detention on Nauru, a tiny island where some stayed for up to three years with little human contact. For every refugee who has overcome incredible odds to build a new life, there is a person whose hope has been consumed by tragedy or a journey to shelter which is just too far. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Worst of all is when the promise on which their hope rested turns out to be as precarious as the lives they left behind. It is no surprise that many refugees who are already suffering under the weight of psychological traumaâ€”from fleeing a crisis or enduring a prolonged ordealâ€”simply could not cope with such gruelling stress. Instead of escaping to safety, these asylum seekers too often found a novel type of torment: physical or psychological isolation, captivity and the restriction of freedom. In such conditions, the most tenacious hope would turn to a spiral of despair. In these conditions, optimism degenerated into severe mental disorders. The evidence is clear that length of confinement is associated with the progressive deterioration in mental state. Similarly, the uncertainty of TPV status was the greatest single contributor amongst refugees to post-traumatic stress disorder. The effects of such trauma are profound and enduring. Refugees held in detention for only a short time have far better settlement outcomes than those in prolonged detention. Those whose faith has survived until settlement in the community are less restless and far more likely to move quickly into employment and accommodation and to build relationships in the community.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I am pleased that under the Labor government the parameters for mandatory detention have been dramatically recast. Labor abolished TPVs, ending that regime of dreadful fear and uncertainty. On 18 October 2010, the Prime Minister and the Minister for Immigration and Citizenship announced that the government would expand the numbers of low-risk and vulnerable family groups and children being housed in community based accommodation rather than in detention centres. Today, children are no longer held in detention centres, and 1,600 people, mainly vulnerable families, are in the community under residence determination. Recently, the Department of Immigration And Citizenship updated this house through Senate estimates. By next year, one-third of asylum seekers will be issued bridging visas to live and work in the community while their claims are assessed, and another 20 percent will be in community detention.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Yesterday the Attorney-General and the Acting Minister for Foreign Affairs announced the next stage in the ratification of the Optional Protocol to the Convention Against Torture in order for Australian law to better reflect our commitment to human rights. OPCAT provides for a robust and thorough inspection regime amongst the detention facilities, including prisons, police custodial facilities and, of course, immigration detention centres.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The national interest analysis tabled yesterday by the government makes it clear that even when human rights are a principal consideration of existing detention facilities, as I believe they are under this Labor government, there is still great benefit in a strengthened inspection regime. Indeed, the New Zealand Human Rights Commission noted in its 2010 annual report that OPCAT was valuable for 'identifying issues and situations that are otherwise overlooked, and in providing authoritative assessments of whether new developments and specific initiatives will meet the international standards for safe and humane detention'. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Checks and balances on any sort of power are a basic requirement for fairness and justice, and there can be no doubt that vigilance regarding human rights should be a basic requirement in the power exercised through the detention system. I look forward to discussing OPCAT, in particular when it comes to the Joint Standing Committee on Treaties, as I believe its ratification is of vital significance to the national interest and to honouring our obligation to the global community. I and this government are deeply committed to finding ways to promote the dignity of the individual, especially the vulnerable and those in need, while advancing the interests of the community as a whole. The continued reform of our immigration system is part of thatâ€”a reform program that will need to be sustained in order to reverse a punitive culture, reflecting the worst of attitudes towards those who seek only safety, that developed under the previous government. I acknowledge that, right now, too many people still languish in long-term detention, I acknowledge that we are still seeking an agreement to prevent lives being risked on leaky boats, and I acknowledge that immigration continues to be one of the most vexed policy issues in Australia, but surely the compassion displayed by Tasmanians at Brighton shows we all agree our policies should be guided by the hope that brings people to our shores to start a new and better life.</span>

                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Senator BACK</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Western Australia</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">13:00</span>):  I rise to express concern over what I see as an increasing disconnect in Australia's education system, a circumstance in which children have become incidental to the whole process and in which process has replaced outcomes. It is delightful to see representatives of the primary schoolchildren of Australia sitting in the chamber observing today.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">In Senate estimates recently, in the Standing Committee on Education, Employment and Workplace Relations, I could not help but think I was on the set of <span style="font-style:italic;">Yes, Minister</span>, that iconic program in which Sir Humphrey Appleby explained to the minister why there were no patients in the hospital beds. This is by no means a reflection on the excellence of Ms Paul and her staff, because I believe they are very diligent officers, but I could not help but think of Minister Hacker saying, 'But, Humphrey, there are no patients!' I am concerned that we have lost the focus. We have taken children out of the centralism for which education should be there. It seems now to have become all about the dollars. It seems to have become all about the process and not about the outcomes. We are not learning about the opportunities for children and what is holding them back from their aspirational goals in education and in development.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">It seems to me that we have almost lost the plot for the direction of education delivery in this country. Despite being some two generations after the postwar period, in which time there has been heavy emphasis on education in this country, and despite an increase in education funding of only 40 per cent in the last 10 or 20 years, where are we? I draw attention to an article by Ms Louise Maher on 24 February on the ABC, in which she recorded that recent surveys have indicated seven million adult Australians have low literacy levels. Some 46 per cent of this survey were poor on prose literacy and 47 per cent were poor on documentary literacy, and it was even lower for numeracy and problem solving. This has to be holding them back in both their life and their employment opportunities. It must be holding business, industry and government back, and therefore it must be affecting productivity.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">It is a decline which Australia cannot afford. For the current generation of children, surveys indicate that in 2000 only one country outperformed Australia in reading and scientific literacy, and only two outperformed Australia in mathematical literacy. Moving forward from 2000 to 2009, not one but six countries outperformed us in reading and science, and we went from third to 13th in mathematical literacy. This is not good enough. It is not good enough for the investment we make, and I believe that this place is where we should be examining it.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Only recently, following Senate estimates, did we have the release of the Grattan Institute report, in which comparisons were made with equivalent schoolchildren in Hong Kong, Shanghai and Singapore. Only then did we learn that we were at least two years behind in those same literacy and numeracy skills. I spoke to primary school principals last night who said to me: 'Yes, but they're only rote learners in Asia. Our students are far more developed. Our excellent students are internationally in demand in engineering, medicine, science and the arts.' Of course they are, but education, as we all know, is across the board. I said to these principals, 'I hope you're not being drawn into a 1960s "Japanese cars are inferior" type of scenario,' and they assured me they were not.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">These are great causes for concern, and I ask, 'Where are the solutions?' In the consultations I have had it seems clear that the solutions lie in developing the team theme. The saying is that it takes a community to raise a child, and it takes a team of three key members to educate that child and to develop them educationally. Those three key members are the parents, the student, and the teacher and those who support them. The point is that if one of that triumvirateâ€”that holy Trinityâ€”is absent then the outcome will be compromised and the child will not develop. I support the strongly made point from teachers that they cannot play the role of two of those three. So I give the challenge: let us get back to the basics; let us let teachers teach; let us promote an image of professionalism in teachers and their profession.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Those of us who have worked in and moved through Asia and India know the reverence with which teachers are held there. Only last night on the ABC program <span style="font-style:italic;">Lateline</span>, I saw the Director-General of Education for Finland being interviewed, telling us that is harder to get into primary school teaching in Finland than it is to get into medicine, that only 10 per cent of applicants for teaching are successful and that nearly all teachers have a master's degree. I say that we must commit parents to engaging in and supporting their children's education and their school, and that they must be there on the positive side and not on the neutral or the negative side. We ought to be putting resources into teachingâ€”not into school halls but into teaching. You can teach a child under a tree if they want to learn. In fact, there are many instances in which many children might be better off spending a good deal of their time outside. They tell me that in Scandinavia, up to year 10, a lot of the learning is done outside. The focus has to be on teaching.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We have to identify the poorly performing teachers. We must counsel them to improve, or if teaching is not for them we must counsel them out of teaching. How would it be, being in charge of children from nine in the morning until 3.30 in the afternoon, if you hate the job day in and day out? All of us know teachers like that. One of us at least I know has been married to a teacher who found themselves in that position. I say we must improve transparency and visibility in the education systemâ€”to children, to parents, to the parents' peers, to the teachers' peers and to the wider community. There is a perception being expressed out there that we have lost the truth and that we need to tell it as it is. It is not about the dollars, I believe; it is about how we spend them.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I am glad my colleague and leader in this area, Senator Mason, is here. We should be asking these questions of the department, the state education systems and the Catholic and independent schools. Why is education so poorly valued in this country? Why do so many teachers have such a poor self-image when it comes to teaching? How many teachers of year 12 students recommend teaching as a profession for their graduating students leaving school? If the answer is zero then we must be asking why that is the case. We must be asking: what aptitude tests are undertaken by universities to identify those students before they commence their course? I richly benefited last night from speaking to primary school principals. There were three groups of five, and I think they all said to me that they believed too many young teachers were graduating without the aptitude for teaching. For heaven's sake, these things are basic! We know that in so many professions nowâ€”medicine, veterinary science, nursing and many othersâ€”we try to understand whether this is a career for that student.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Why is it that so many young teachers go into teaching with so much vim and vigourâ€”usually in country areasâ€”only to find that the isolation and the complexity drags them down, and then they either leave that school or that town, or teaching, dispirited? Why is that the case? Are we examining what the wastage rate is? What number of teachers after one, three or five years are no longer teaching? I would like to see that information in the state system and also in the Catholic and independent school systems.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I would like to know the movement rate between those schools. In my own state of Western Australia I think up to 40 per cent of state schools now have, or are moving to, independent public status. We in this place need to understand what I term the 'wastage rate'â€”that is, those who are leaving the professionâ€”in the independent public schools as opposed to the traditional state schools. We all know, and probably we in this place are an example, that people move between professions. I have the privilege of being in my eighth complete career change. I ask the question because we know in many instances people will leave a profession but at some time in the future they will go back to it because the original career was of enormous interest and benefit. Among those of my associates and family members who have been or still are teachers, I do not know of a single one who left the profession to go into something else who then said teaching was more appealing and more satisfying and they wanted to go back into teaching. Even those who remain in the education system and get elevated into the halls of powerâ€”how many of them go back into the classroom? This is the disconnect about which I speak, and I think we simply do not have sufficient information to be able to assist and drive that process.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">From listening to the director-general of education from Finland, and also from reading briefly the executive summary of the Grattan Institute report, I know about the amount of mentoring that younger teachers get from more senior teachers, the support in the classroom and the emphasis and focus on the students themselves. A teacher very close to me made the point that teaching can be a very isolating experience: 'Parents, principals and local communities need to back the teachers. They are often left to defend themselves in the face of unreasonable parents and unsupportive principals and, in many cases, students who are totally unresponsive.' Principals must have the right, in my belief, to hire and fire and should also be able to set reasonable standards not only for their own teachers but for classroom behaviour, and they must be able to deal with students who do not fit in. This is a three-part race: it is the teachers, it is the parents and it is the students. Disruptive students should not have the right to dominate a class environment, a team environment, and disrupt others from learning.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I was asking a principal about this once and he said to me: 'Why can't we look at an option in the same geographic area, so as to not disturb people residentially, where we classify schools into 'excellent', 'ordinary' and 'poor' and teachers rotate on a two-yearly basis so that one who is in an excellent school moves to a poor school and hopefully takes some of the practices of that excellent school to the poor school.? A teacher in an underperforming school will know they have got only that two years and then they we will be moving up, so, over time, we will see continual improvement.' All too often we have a scenario in which teachers find themselves in the one school and never move.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">
                  <span style="font-style:italic;" />I believe very firmly that we have got to get away from this practice in Australia where nobody is allowed to fail. We do fail; we all fail. Teachers must be able to be honest. Teachers must be able to make mistakes, and so must their students. Teachers must be able to grade honestly and they must be able to fail students. Students must know where they fit in the group; only then can a student start to make reasonable choices and realise that more work is required of them if they are to achieve. If they do not learn this in the school environment, they are in for an almighty shock, as we all know, when they get into the postschool environment. I believe that we are underselling our students. We must tell students that life is what they make of it: that, if a door opens and they do not take the opportunity behind it, the opportunity will not be there againâ€”but who knows what other opportunities will emerge? We must tell them that success is the direct result of determination and effort. Incidentally, I have seen these comments made in the media recently. We must allow students to stop looking for easy options and to get out of their comfort zone. I urge young teachers to apply that thinking as wellâ€”get out of your comfort zone and take responsibility for your own decisions and courses of action and for their consequences. It is okay to make a mistake; but learn from it and do not repeat itâ€”learn about risk. I believe that, at the moment, the education system is not imparting the skills that students and teachers need. <span style="font-style:italic;">(Time expired)</span></span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">
                  <a href="I07" type="MemberSpeech">
                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Senator LUDLAM</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Western Australia</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">13:15</span>):  I rise to make a few comments on the WikiLeaks publishing organisation and its editor-in-chief, Julian Assange. Although most people probably had not come across WikiLeaks until its stunning series of document releases in 2010, the organisation has been around since 2006. Its key innovation is a secret drop-box where whistleblowers can provide documents to journalists, and the journalists do not necessarily know who the sources are. That is, I think, the key innovation of this organisationâ€”a journalist cannot be hauled into court and forced to disclose who their source is, because they do not know who it is.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">WikiLeaks, despite having existed and done valuable work for a number of years, did not really burst into public consciousness until 2010 with the release of a collateral murder video which shows US forces quite casually obliterating a city block, killing a Reuters journalist and his associates and then seriously wounding a number of children who happened to be in a van that drove up to try to clean up and take the bodies out of the combat zone. Subsequently, the Afghanistan and Iraq war logs provided us with a glimpse into the conduct of these wars, one of which Australia is still engaged in. In the Afghan war logs we discovered that there had been 114 incidents of coalition military attacks on civilians. Ninety-one thousand field reports were made public. Many of them are mundane, but many of them also give us an extraordinary insight into how war is fought in the 21st century.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">There are revelations in the Afghan war logsâ€”and in the Iraq war logs, which were released a short time laterâ€”of war crimes on the part of our ally the United States. Iraq Body Count, the London-based group that monitored civilian casualties during the Iraq conflict, says that it identified around 15,000 previously unknown and unreported civilian deaths from the data contained in the leaked war logs. Iraq Body Count discovered that US authorities were systematically failing to investigate hundreds of reports of torture and rape and of extrajudicial killing by Iraqi police and military forces. The conduct was systematic and completely unpunished, and the Australian public, who were taken into the disastrous and illegal war in Iraq, did not know about it because the material had failed to make its way into the press and onto the public record.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Late in 2010 occurred probably the most important release to dateâ€”depending on how you see these thingsâ€”when the publication of Department of State cables put the WikiLeaks organisation and its editor-in-chief, Julian Assange, onto the front pages of the world's newspapers. The Department of State cables give us a different view: an insight into how global diplomacy is conducted. They contain interesting things about Australian political personalities and about the conduct of ministersâ€”foreign ministers in particularâ€”and they give us a window into how the United States conducts its activities around the world.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">It should be said, of course, that WikiLeaks does not exist to undermine the United States government. Mr Assange is on the recordâ€”and I paraphrase hereâ€”as saying: 'The more you have to hide, the more you have to fear. Regimes such as China, which do not have the democratic protections that exist here in Australia and even in the United States, have more to fear: there are more secrets there, so there is more to be disclosed.' Indeed, the first serious revelations which WikiLeaks was able to publish in partnership with other media organisations were about Kenya. There is nothing necessarily anti-American going on here, but leaks are emerging from within the United States military and diplomatic corps that shine a spotlight on how the US government works and just how far from reality the spin is.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">For its extraordinary and important work WikiLeaks has been correctly recognised as a publishing organisation and its editor-in-chief as a journalist. As recently as late last year the Walkley Foundation awarded Mr Assange the Walkley award for most outstanding contribution to journalism in 2011. The ruling of 2 November 2011 by the Queen's Bench division of the British High Court acknowledged that Mr Assange is a journalist and WikiLeaks a publishing organisation. Right around the worldâ€”in Italy and in Spain and in the form of the Amnesty International UK media award 2009â€”it has been acknowledged that WikiLeaks is a publishing outfit and that this organisation has nothing to do with terrorism.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Senior US administration figures are on record as saying that no essential damage has been done to US interests as a result of the activities of WikiLeaks. On 11 August 2010, a spokesman for the Pentagon told the <span style="font-style:italic;">Washington Post</span>:</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Small">We have yet to see any harm come to anyone in Afghanistan that we can directly tie to exposure in the Wikileaks documents.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Moreover, an Australian Department of Defence investigation concluded in October 2010 that the leaked documents had 'not had a direct significant adverse impact on Australia's national interests'. That assessment has been backed up by the then US Secretary of Defense, Robert Gates, and the US Secretary of State, Hillary Clinton, who have been downplaying the impact of the releases and saying that they have not in fact affected US security interests.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Nonetheless, there is a fierce campaign afoot to destroy WikiLeaks: to discredit Mr Assange and his associates and colleagues and to set the organisation backâ€”in fact, to simply destroy it. We discovered a great deal about this last night when five million emails from the private American security organisation Stratfor were released in the latest document drop by WikiLeaks. Stratfor's Vice President for Counterterrorism and Corporate Security is a gentleman named Fred Burton. He is a former deputy chief of the Department of State's counterterrorism division, so there has obviously been a revolving door in the United Statesâ€”many of Stratfor's staff have come to it from the US intelligence and defence community.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">In early 2011, Burton revealed in internal Stratfor correspondence that there had been an indictment made by the secret grand jury which, as we were aware, had been empanelled in the United States. This email, which is from Australia Day 2011, reads:</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Small">Not for Pubâ€”we have a sealed indictment on Assange. Pls protect.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">In a later email he says:</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Small">Assange is going to make a nice bride in prison. Screw the terrorist. He'll be eating cat forever.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Charming! Further emails reveal that the strategies that were enabled by things like the US Patriot Act which were implemented by the Bush and Cheney administration after the attacks of 9-11 were being used not simply to track down and destroy terrorist networks but to track down and destroy media organisations. This further email says:</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Small">Take down the money. Go after his infrastructure. The tool we are using to nail and de-construct Wiki are the same tools used to dismantle and track aQ [Al Qaeda]. Thank Cheney &amp; 43â€”</span>

                <span class="HPS-Small">Ferreting out [Julian Assange's] confederates is also key. Find out what other disgruntled rogues inside the tent or outside [sic]. Pile on. Move him from country to country to face various charges for the next 25 years. But, seize everything he and his family own, to include every person linked to Wiki.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">You thought Team America was fiction, but that is how these people appear to behave behind the scenes in emails that they do not think will be read by the general public.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">There has been a targeted campaign of character assassination in the public realm that ties in with this secret process of a grand jury indictment. Now we know, from an email that was sent on Australia Day last year, that such an indictment exists. That means the United States can potentially move to extradite Mr Assange from Sweden if he ends up there, from the UK if he remains there or from Australiaâ€”in fact, from any country with which the United States has an extradition agreement.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The campaign to destroy the WikiLeaks organisation needs to stop. This is a publishing organisation and it is essential that we know that the Australian government has done, and intends to do, everything that it can to protect Mr Assange and the organisation.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">There is one further email from Stratfor for the Senate to consider. Burton says that he will:</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Small">â€¦ pursue [c]onspiracy and [p]olitical [t]errorism charges of declassified the death of a source someone which [he] could link to Wiki.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Burton's strategy is to:</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Small">â€¦ [b]ankrupt the arsehole â€¦ ruin his life. Give him 7-12 years for conspiracy.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">That is absolutely key. At the point where this indictment was meant to hit the table, all of a sudden by pure coincidence the world's newspapers would be carrying a story that a source named in one of the WikiLeaks documents, which were extensively redacted by the organisation, would be all over the front pagesâ€”that somebody had died as a result of the WikiLeaks drop. It is unbelievably cynical to pursue a strategy like that in order to try and destroy this organisation.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We need to know what the role of the Australian government in this has been. If a private security company in Texas has known for well over a year that this sealed indictment exists, did the United States government share that with its close ally Australia or not? The Prime Minister, the Minister for Foreign Affairs, whoever that currently is, and the Attorney-General have some very difficult questions to answer. I will be putting this question to the Prime Minister's representative in this chamber shortly after two o'clock this afternoon. So I am putting the Prime Minister on notice now.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Is Australia ignorant in this matter or complicit? I do not see a great deal of room for splitting the difference. Did the United States government hide this information from the Australian Prime Minister and the Australian defence and intelligence community, keeping us ignorant about the fate of an Australian citizen and journalist, or did they disclose that information which makes Australia complicit in this unbelievable attack on a media organisation that has done nothing more than do what journalists are supposed to doâ€”tell the truth about what is going on behind the scenes by people in power? </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We have heard quite sensible comments from Senator Brandis. We have seen Mr Turnbull on the record. We have had Mr Rudd on the record saying, 'People tearing up passports is my responsibility.' We have no idea yet what the new foreign minister will say. We have not heard anything from our current Attorney-General.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Late last year I initiated a series of freedom of information requests. They have been stonewalled, they have been blocked, they have been frustrated and there have been excuses every couple of weeks about why it is so difficult to disclose this kind of information; so we do not yet know whether the Australian government is incompetent and ignorant or complicit. But if there is some other answer I would be very interested to find out what it is. We have put dozens of questions on notice to try to establish what the Australian government knew and it is time that the Australian government came clean. It is no longer acceptable for the Prime Minister to simply keep her head down and hope this will all go away, because push is about to come to shove, quite seriously.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Mr Assange has now been under house arrest for 448 days, an extraordinary period of time, during which the organisation has continued to do extraordinarily valuable work in feeding the world's media news organisations with the primary source documentation for story after story after story. So if Mr Assange is complicit and has committed crimes then so is the editor of the <span style="font-style:italic;">New York Times</span> and the <span style="font-style:italic;">Guardian</span> and the people who write for Australia's Fairfax press and the ABC.

                <span class="HPS-Normal">There is one final email that I want to quote from which I think really underlines the importance of the Australian government stepping up now, today, in defence of this Australian citizen:</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">

                <span class="HPS-Normal">I am one of those. I met Mr Assange late last year. He has met with many news editors, he has met with journalists from all over the world and he has helped them do their job. So we are all implicated in this. If you are hearing this from the press gallery, the people who signed on to the Walkley Foundation's sign-on letter last year, publishing organisations around the world and around the country, an attack on this organisation is an attack on all of us. If the world is not safe for an organisation like WikiLeaks, then it is not safe for any of us.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">I am calling on the Australian government to come clean about what it knows and do what it quite rightly did in the instance of the boy in Bali who found himself in serious legal trouble when he was caught in possession of a small quantity of marijuana. The Australian government put people on planes, they sent assistance, phones rang and people got onto the Indonesian authorities to make sure that that boy had the best consular and legal assistance that could possibly be made available to him, and rightly so. What we have seen in the case of Mr Julian Assange, who is working as a journalist and has provided some of the most important revelations on the conduct of war and commerce and diplomacy in modern history, is silence. It is time that that silence was lifted.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">
                  <a href="204953" type="MemberSpeech">
                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Senator GALLACHER</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">South Australia</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">13:29</span>):  I rise to speak on an issue of great importance to all South Australians, and that is the health of the River Murray. Indeed, we are within the 20-week consultation period, which I believe is an opportunity for the Murray-Darling Basin Authority to really discuss the outcomes of the draft plan and develop the final plan without the extreme rhetoric that has been played out in the media.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">If we do not have the level-headed discussion needed, we run a very high risk of no action. I am talking about a plan that does not favour one outcome over another, but an outcome that achieves healthy rivers, strong communities and sustainable food production. I believe this is paramount and we have a real opportunity to achieve this now. We must not let it slip. If no action were to occur it would result in some major implications for South Australia, because that state has the most to lose. Not taking any action will not only result in the environmental deterioration of the River Murray but also run the risk of destroying whole communities in South Australia.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Future droughts, coupled with the status quo, would devastate the whole River Murray. When seeing coalition leaders playing politics on this issue rather than doing the right thing for the Murray-Darling Basin a lot of South Australians are very concerned.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I believe we should recognise that the Murray-Darling Basin Authority is an independent authority that has no political motive in this debate, so its process of consultation and science must be respected. It is pleasing to see prominent South Australian Liberal Party members recognise this and even support the Murray-Darling Basin Authority Plan. However, their federal leader, Mr Tony Abbott, is far less than convincing. On this side of the chamber, our position remains unchanged. It is well known that in the 2010 federal election the health of the River Murray was a primary issue for the South Australian Labor Party.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I am not going to stand here and play the numbers game on the sustainable diversion limits. We have seen the debate progress from the numbers produced, when the guide to the draft came out, through to November, when the draft plan was produced. Now we are hearing groups state various numbers in this consultation period, and I am sure there will be even greater debate when the actual plan is released.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The number of gigalitres should not be the issue in this debate. Instead, we should be discussing what is needed to achieve the right outcome. What I have seen of the draft plan is that this is an achievable goal, and I am confident that after this consultation period the three main outcomes will set out our path to long-lasting reform. These main outcomes are healthy rivers, strong communities and sustainable food production. This reform will strengthen the resilience of the Murray-Darling Basin system so that in times of drought and with the effects of climate change the Murray has a chance to remain in a position that will not be compromised.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">One of the major issues for South Australians when talking about the three outcomes is salinity. This is a real issue for the lower regions of the Murray as on occasions some areas are too salty for drinking, irrigation and livestock. For many years now we have heard expert after expert express the problems, particularly in the lower regions of the Murray. Salinity does damage to the crops for irrigators and also damages the ecological life that resides in the Murray. Low flows have meant exposure of acid sulphate soils to the air and increasing salinity.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The issue of salinity was wonderfully put in the House committee report into the Murray-Darling system:</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Small">The soils and groundwater of the Basin release salts into the rivers. This salinity is natural and, under natural conditions would be transported down the system and out the mouth during times of high rainfall.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">It goes on to say:</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Small">â€¦ the MDBA estimate that two million tons of salt would need to be flushed out of the system each year to balance the entry of salt into the rivers.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The report continues with a detailed explanation:</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Small">Droughts tend to see less salt regularly flushed from soil profiles or flowing through depleted aquifers. Flows move salt through the river system. Flows out of the Murray mouth prevent the accumulation of salts in the Lower Lakes and Coorong. During the drought, the Murray mouth has been dredged open. The mouth of the Murray was regularly sand blocked prior to river regulation by structures and lochs. The health of the entire Murray-Darling Basin is not indicated by the open or closure of the Murray mouth.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Small">The saline nature and propensity for blue-green algal outbreaks are inherent in the character of the ephemeral Basin streams. Ensuring there are adequate flows to move and flush salt and nutrients out of the system is a responsibility of all who depend on its waters</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Yes, this does go into the issue of dry-land salinity, as well, but also illustrates the need for the Murray to dilute the saline inflows and to the flush the saline water that has entered the river and simply sits there due to the lack of flow. This is very insightful, and shows the importance of a healthy river system.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">South Australia has also been acting to reduce salinity by keeping the mouth open through dredging. Other important initiatives, such as recycling water through stormwater capture and the construction of the desalination plant, have been aimed at reducing our reliance on the Murray. However, the most important way of flushing the salinity out of the system is through greater flows, and the only way for this to occur without waiting for floodwaters or greater rain is by returning more water to the Murray-Darling Basin.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">South Australian communities have also felt the full brunt of the drought, on top of the low flows to the mouth of the Murray. Communities have suffered from a lack of tourism, which has only recently come back to life due to last year's floods. Fish are back and the boats are back and activity is occurring.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">But let us talk briefly about the lost voices in the deterioration of the River Murrayâ€”that is, the native fish, birds and other animal species. They should not be lost in the conversation. I am confident that the Murray-Darling Basin Authority is using the best available information to develop the basin plan and help the natural habitat of these species.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">South Australians do not want to see bandaid solutions such as dredging, which has come at a cost of around $40 million. For eight years, six million cubic metres of material has been removed from the mouth. Thankfully, with the floodwaters making their way to the mouth, dredging was halted in 2010. However, South Australia should not accept bandaid solutions any more, and that is why reform is drastically needed. I ask all senators and members in this place to consider the plight of South Australia, a state that has done its share of hard yards supporting the Murray. It is not just about the Murray mouth being open. Let us not forget that during the drought South Australian irrigators also faced increasingly greater costs in purchasing additional water allocations or in reducing the water to their crops, typically a lose-lose situation. In this debate we must also remember that in 1969 South Australia had capped its own allocations, using only seven per cent of the extracted water in the Murray-Darling Basin. Continued growth in water use led to a basin-wide cap on surface water diversions being imposed in 1995. All jurisdictions now have a cap on surface water diversions in place. It should also be noted that many parts of the basin have seen little or no growth in diversions for some decades.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The Australian government's approach to water recovery is based on the common starting point of today's allowable diversions. No-one has been singled out under this approach, and no-one is disadvantaged. It is a real  shame that other states do not recognise this move by South Australia in 1969 or recognise the work that South Australia has done for the Murray. What this cap did for our state is that our irrigators had to change their behaviour with regard to water. They have done this with the greatest success, maintaining high levels of food production within their allocation of water. We are well-known improvers on how we use water, and this has been done through investment in technologies and increased efficiencies. We hope that the model of innovative technologies improving efficiencies for irrigation will be integrated throughout the Murray-Darling Basin.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I have been very public on the issue of infrastructure and I will continue to advocate for investments in this area because it is a practical solution that benefits irrigators and the river. It is extremely pleasing to see that improvement in infrastructure is an important objective of this federal government. As I have said, we have seen infrastructure projects work in South Australia. If these are applied to the rest of the country with even greater innovative advancement, much more water can be left to flow down the river. The Labor government is putting $4.8 billion in to hundreds of infrastructure and water management projects across the basin as part of the Water for the Future initiative. This is part of the government's commitment to bridge the gap to the proposed levels of water use through investment in irrigation efficiency upgrades and voluntary water purchases, which are getting much more water back to the environment.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">If no action is taken and outcomes are not reached, then that will continue to contribute to the trend of decline in many local communities, especially in South Australia. Putting reform in the too-hard basket should not be an option. We have already seen over 1,000 gigalitres recovered. Stopping now will be to the detriment of the work already achieved. The government has also made a commitment that we will not forcibly take water from irrigatorsâ€”something that is easily forgotten in this debate. The possibility of no reform is not an option that a South Australian federal parliamentarian can take. Â Â Â I am sure I have the support of all my South Australian federal parliamentary Labor colleagues, and I am certain that reform is the sentiment of the majority of South Australians.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The Murray-Darling Basin is not a system that should be looked at solely through the eyes of a South Australian, and I can well understand some of the concerns raised by other states and groups. However, we all have a lot to lose if we cannot take this once-in-a-lifetime opportunity to fix things. The health of the Murray-Darling Basin is an issue for all Australians, because it affects our ability to produce food in the basin and the ability for communities to thrive. This is not a time to come to a grinding halt halfway through the job. If we pull through, we can achieve the healthy river, strong communities and sustainable food production that we are all seeking. I urge all those in the Senate to understand what the river means to South Australia and to support the federal government and the reforms that are needed to ensure we achieve these goals.</span>

                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Senator JOYCE</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Queensland</span>â€”<span class="HPS-MinisterialTitles">Leader of The Nationals in the Senate</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">13:41</span>):  I rise today to talk about the Murray-Darling Basin. Being within my shadow portfolio responsibilities, it is something that is obviously very close to my heart. If we did a word association game with the Murray-Darling, I think many Australians would think of the food the basin produces and the environmental assets it contains. The Murray-Darling has played a pivotal and iconic role in the development of Australia, from a country that at one point had problems with food production. We had times of starvation in Australia not long after whites settled, in the convict daysâ€”and we would not want to return to those days.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Not too many Australians realise that 2.1 million of us live in the Murray-Darling today. Another million, while living outside of the basin, rely on it for their water supplies. If the Murray-Darling were a state it would be roughly equal in size to Western Australia. The people who live and work in the basin are often the forgotten elements of the Murray-Darling Basin Plan. There is much talk about gigalitres and environmental watering plans but less about how we can design a plan that does notâ€”and this is extremely importantâ€”pull the economic rug or the social rug out from underneath millions of Australians. These Australians are the descendants of thousands of Australian pioneers who went west and scratched out a living, as was asked of them by their nation. They fed their family, they fed their town, they fed their community, they fed their state and they fed our nation. Now they feed not only our nation but people overseas as well. Their labours have produced the towns of Shepparton, Mildura, Renmark, Griffith, Bourke, Moree, my home town of St George and many others. The economies of these towns are quite substantial. Towns such as St George in the last year produced $640 million worth of cotton and a couple of hundred million dollars worth of grain, as well as cattle, sheep and everything on top of that. If a nation wants to pay its debts, it must make money; it must invest in where it makes money and it must accept that it produces a product that other people are willing to buy.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">The pioneers who went out west and developed our nation sometimes do not get full kudos. We have this long-lasting legacy of real wealth and easy access to a wide variety of fresh food. One of the greatest responsibilities of any government is to feed its people and to protect its food sovereignty: the capacity to feed itself. So often we are losing this as we import more and more products and as we shut down agricultural areas, which will exacerbate the problem. We have representatives of these Australian people here in Canberra today. I would like to formally recognise the representatives from Women for a Living Basin who have made the trip to Canberra today. Their stories are some that are not told often enough. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The Basin Plan will have its biggest direct impact on those that hold irrigation licences. Those who hold an irrigation licence will generally get paid, but those who live in a town from which irrigation licences are taken will not. It is a ripple effect through the townâ€”to the mortgage holder, to the tyre shop, to the motel. These people do not get paid. These people are left literally high and dry and are put out of business by the government.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We can see that impact in the data. House prices in 25 towns that the authority identified as 'vulnerable' have fallen by four per cent, according to RP Data, in the year after the release of the botched <span style="font-style:italic;">Guide to the Murray-Darling Basin</span>. House prices have fallen in Finley by 17 per cent, in Hay by 15 per cent and in Stanhope by 10 per cent. Those price falls came after house prices had risen in these towns in the year prior, by nine per cent. I saw that in my own town. During the drought house prices went through the floor. Since the drought we have had one of the most successful increases in house prices. But what this has the capacity to do is lock in a permanent 'drought' in some areas.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The government's botched Basin Plan process, however, has dampened that new confidence even as the rain has continued to fall, because people are asking, despite the rain falling, whether the government will turn off the water. We can see that impact at the consultations that the Murray-Darling Basin Authority has held throughout the basin. In one week, more than 15,000 people turned out in Shepparton, Griffith and Deniliquin to voice their concerns about the plan. Deniliquin experienced its biggest-ever traffic jamâ€”possibly its first-ever traffic jam. We can see the impact in the impassioned speeches that were delivered at these consultations. Bernie Roebuck, the principal of Finley High School, gave an impassioned plea for us to concentrate not just on the farms and the wetlands but on the broader impact of what we are doingâ€”and this is a teacher talkingâ€”on the schools and on the social fabric. As Bernie said:</span>

              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Small">Constantly I hear that emotive calls, emotive language, emotive pleas, emotive people should be dismissed as the lunatic fringe because they exaggerate, they misrepresent, they do not produce balance nor facts in dealing with the plan.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Small">I would say how can one not be emotive if your livelihood, and all that is important to you, is at stake. I see no reason for us to need to apologise for being emotive. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">It is for this reason that it is so important that these women have made the trip to Canberra today. The fundamental problem with the Basin Plan approach has been that it is driven from Canberra, not from the people in the basin with the greatest knowledge and the capacity to bring about an outcome that will have the least economic and social effects and will deliver what people want, which is water for the basin. It is of constant bemusement to me that the Murray-Darling Basin Authority has one office for the basin, in Canberra, and another in Adelaide, Adelaide not actually being in the basin while Canberra is, in fact, the biggest city in the basin. So the question has to be asked: what about the other placesâ€”Griffith, Deniliquin, Swan Hill or Berri? It would be helpful if there were a greater concentration of shopfronts for the people in the basin in the areas most likely to be affected by the decisions of this plan. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">When you read the draft basin plan there is no indication of how they have factored in the economic and social impacts of their decisions. You do not read anywhere, 'Well, we won't take so much water from this area, because the impacts would be too great on a social or an economic basis.' They made promises and they paid for consultantsâ€”and no doubt they have all got their chequesâ€”but we have never actually been able to clearly identify a change to the plan by reason of social and economic factors. The draft plan reads as one giant black box that none of us, those who eventually have to vote on this plan, have the privilege of seeing inside. I fear that this black box has had to be constructed because the plan has become more about political compromise than a true and fair balance of economic, social and environmental concernsâ€”which is actually what both the Labor Party and the coalition promised. I fear that, as Bismarck would remark, 'the lesser the people know about how sausages and laws are made, the better they sleep in the night'.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">This approach is not good enough. We promised the people of the basin a triple bottom line. We promised people we would balance the economic, social and environÂ­mental outcomes. We cannot yet tell whether such a balance has been achieved because we do not have the detail in front of us. We all recognise that we need to protect the environmental health of the basin and that some of that will require a reduction in the amount of water used in the basin. But that is already happening.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Before the Basin Plan process was even started, the last Liberal-National government returned almost 500 gigalitres of water to the Murray through the Living Murray Initiative. Such amounts were achieved without the rancour and wasteful buyback rounds that we have seen from this government. These reductions were carried out in consultation with local communities, a process that the recent Windsor report praised but which the government seems to have ignored. They do not seem to look after their Independent mates when it actually counts for the rest of us. When it came to office, the government turned its back on these successful approaches and instead launched headlong into a haphazard and ill-thought-through buyback process. It all sounds good in theory: buy water from willing sellers. What could go wrong? Well, plenty did. The government spent $23.75 million to purchase Toorale Station, near Bourke. They did not even bother to inspect it before they purchased it. We know that today the government is yet to touch the infrastructure at Toorale, partly because an environmental assessment deemed that the irrigation infrastructure had created its own ecological climate which should not be destroyed. So the ring tanks and cells continue to fill but there are no jobs and the Bourke Shire Council has lost a substantial section of its rateable base. What is more: even if they were to let the water go, it would not go to the river but out to a floodplain.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The government also bought $303 million of water from Twynam Agricultural Company. From the government's own figures, we know the cost of this water was around $2,800 per megalitre, compared to an average cost so far of $1,900 per megalitre. So when they do buy water they are not prudent enough to do a proper assessment of how they could buy it for a proper price. Its rushed approach to buybacks was in stark contrast to its foot-dragging on investment in upgraded irrigation and on-farm infrastructure. Investing to upgrade our water delivery practices can save water for the environment and local communities. It is a justified choice given the social dividend that this investment provides. That is why when the last Liberal-National  government announced its Murray-Darling plan, it called for this spending to be prioritised. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Instead, the exact opposite has happened. The government has spent more than originally planned on buybacks and less than hoped for on infrastructure funding. So far $1.75 billion has been spent on water buybacks, while only $280 million has been spent on infrastructure which actually delivers water into the basin. Now they are continuing that process. Just last year the inquiry of the House of Representatives Standing Committee on Regional Australia into the Murray-Darling Basin lambasted the government for its poor handling of the buyback and infrastructure programs. The report, which was agreed to by Labor, coalition and Independent members said:.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">the department of waterâ€”</span>

                <span class="HPS-Small">across Basin communities resulting from the failure of the department to identify and respond to community concerns on a range of issues. In addition, this department has demonstrated a consistent failure to deliver water programs, including strategic water buyback, which is in the best interests of productive communities. This department should no longer be responsible for delivering these programs.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The report recommended that the government end its non-strategic approach to buybacks, and this is something that the coalition put forward in its Murray-Darling policy at the 2010 election. The government agreed that it would freeze buybacks in the southern system. So it came as a shock to many in the basin that the government announced a new round of buybacks in the southern basin last week. Minister Burke argued in the other place yesterday, in response to a question from the member for New England, that this really was a non-strategic buyback process and was exactly what Murray-Darling communities were asking for. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">That was news to them. Every major irrigation company has come out to criticise the government which, in its chaotic form of government that we are currently experiencÂ­ing, once again has failed to think this through. Once again, it has failed to talk to them properly. Today in the Colleambally <span style="font-style:italic;">Observer</span> John Culleton, CEO of Colleambally Irrigation, rejected Minister Burke's explanation to parliament as 'nonsense'. He said: </span>
              </p>

                <span class="HPS-Small">The notion this initiative is in any way strategic is just nonsense; itâ€™s quite clear the real purpose is about buying water as cheaply as possible and being seen to be ticking-off on one of the Windsor Inquiryâ€™s recommendations and little else. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Small">Whatâ€™s doubly galling is that this announcement should come as it has â€“ out of the blue; so much for commitment to recovering water in smarter ways and the promise of improved engagement and transparency. </span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">This is the hallmark of the government's approach to the Murray-Darlingâ€”lots of announcements, very little consultation and completely chaotic planning. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We are now 14 weeks into the 20-week consultation period announced after the draft. So far the Murray-Darling Basin Authority has announced only nine public meetings. After the release of the guide to the Murray-Darling Basin Plan they held 33 public meetings. This time meetings have been held at inconvenient times, such as during the grape harvest in Mildura. There is a growing sense of frustration at the lack of detail and lack of consultation that has been provided. Nobody can say how much water is needed for specific environmental assets. This plan is not just about the one or two iconic environmental assets; it is about 2,442 key environmental assets throughout the basin. Nobody can explain how much water is needed for each, how they are going to get it there, where they are going to store it and what the socioeconomic effects will be on the places they take it from. It is complete and utter chaos.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Every irrigator in the basin knows how much water is needed for the different paddocks in their fields. The government will now be the biggest irrigator in the country, but we cannot get any detail of how they are going to water their assets. They do not even know what to do with the water that they have got now. Last financial year they were allocated 724 gigalitres of environmental water but used only 387 gigalitres. Five gigalitres was wasted when it could not be carried over to the next year. The government cannot even say how much water will come from each catchment. Instead, they have hung X factorsâ€”I do not know what X stands for; maybe it is the Xenophon factorâ€”over every basin community. How can they say that the economic and social impacts are not excessive on a particular town if they will not even tell how much will come from that town? </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">But this is not just about the towns in the basin and the 2.1 million people who live in them. This plan involves all Australians. If you push a shopping trolley you are part of the basin. If you want grocery prices to stay down you are part of the basin. If you are proud of Austria's capacity to produce its own food you are part of the basin. If you believe that people who have done what this nation has asked them toâ€”go west, scratch out a living and deal with the privations of remoteness as honourable peopleâ€”then you believe in the basin. But, if we believe somehow that borrowing money from overseas to shut down productive assets and reduce our capacity to repay our debts is a smart move, then we are fools, all of us. </span>

The question does lie well outside my portfolio duties; but, given that I have only two question times left, I am very happy to answer the question for you, Senator, and I will be as direct as possible. I have not actually read the <span style="font-style:italic;">Australian</span> article so it is very difficult for me to deal with the detail in the article itself. I had no conversations, prior to my announcement and prior to talking to the Prime Minister, with former Premier Bob Carr whatsoever, and I was very surprised when it was raised in the media. The speculation that somehow there had been a deal or some sort of set-up is totally incorrect. When I spoke to the Prime Minister about my decision she was totally unaware, and that was following the leadership ballot. So I think the speculation in some of the newspapers and some of the online commentary is incorrect. <span style="font-style:italic;">(Time expired)</span></span>

We did not object on the basis that Senator Arbib was quite happy to give as good as he got; but, quite frankly, when the question is out of order, is not related to his portfolio and is so wide ranging, it is pretty hard to see how the minister can respond in any other way than be wide ranging in response. </span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Western Australia</span>â€”<span class="HPS-MinisterialTitles">Minister for Tertiary Education, Skills, Science and Research and Leader of the Government in the Senate</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">14:07</span>):  I thank Senator Crossin for her question and acknowledge her campaigns for paid parental leave for Australian women and men throughout her time in politics. This government is very proud that we have delivered real reform for working Australians, especially with the paid parental leave scheme. The government's scheme is just one example of the important reforms we are making to support families.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I am pleased to inform the Senate today that since being introduced in January 2011 the paid parental leave scheme has received more than 140,000 applications from Australian families. As a result of Labor's reforms, families now have the opportunity to take the time they need to welcome and support a new child into their family. They no longer have to worry about their job security when they take a decent period of parental leave. I am also pleased to announce that 82,000 parents have already received the parental leave entitlement in full. These Labor reforms have provided essential financial security to people during one of the most important times of their lives. The scheme is also good for business in that it is based on recommendations by the Productivity Commission that said the scheme would not only support the health outcomes of children and mothers but also, as part of the arrangements we have put in place, encourage people back into work and training.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We have had large numbers of businesses registering for the scheme and we have had a successful operation of the scheme. This is delivering for families the sort of support they need. It is delivered through sustainable funding from this government. It is designed in a way that allows it to be affordable to the federal budget without putting an unfair burden on businesses. This is a responsible, balanced scheme delivered by this government after 11 years of neglect by the Howard government. <span style="font-style:italic;">(Time expired)</span></span>

It has generally been regarded as 'the millionaire mums scheme' because it is so generous to very-high-income earners. I understand now that his own backbenchers have described it as a 'Rolls Royce scheme', including Senator Boyce. They understand that the scheme can be funded only by putting an extra 1.7 per cent tax on employers.</span>

Is the minister aware of comments by the Chief Executive of Australia's largest power generator, Macquarie Generation, that as a direct result of Labor's carbon tax electricity prices will rise by more than the Gillard government has let on? Is this why the Minister for Resources and Energy, Mr Ferguson, said earlier this week that Labor's carbon tax could be to our disadvantage as a nation?</span>

That is why we have put forward, and this has been endorsed by this chamber, a very comprehensive set of assistance to Australian households that recognises the additional costs flowing from a carbon price. That assistance, as the senator knows, will be provided through increases to the pension, the disability support pension, family tax benefits and other payments including a tripling of the tax-free thresholdâ€”all of which are to be clawed back by those opposite. In relation to what would disadvantage the nation, I again go back to what I said yesterday.</span>

What would disadvantage the nation is a carbon price over double what the government is proposing, without assistance to Australian families, that will cost 1,300 per household per annum out to 2020, that will impose a greater cost on Australian business, that relies on bureaucracy to pick winners without any guarantee that emissions will actually fall. That is the coalition's proposition. It is a higher cost proposition not only for the economy, not only for Australian business, but also, and worst of all, it is a higher cost that would be levied on Australian households and familiesâ€”the same people that you want to take benefits from. <span style="font-style:italic;">(Time expired)</span></span>

We have already provided increases to assistance through the education tax refund and we are providing more funding to Australian families through the childcare rebate. We are serious about ensuring that we manage the economy, including managing the changes that a carbon price will bring, with a very clear eye to supporting Australian families, and that is what we have done. It stands in stark contrast to the economic illiteracy of those opposite, who are going to take taxes from Australian families and give them to large polluting companies with no significant benefit to the environment, at a higher cost to the economy and at a higher cost to the Australian taxpayer. The senator should remind everybody that he supports lower family tax benefits and lower pensions. <span style="font-style:italic;">(Time expired)</span></span>

Did our ally the United States give the Prime Minister the courtesy of a disclosure and, if so, when? Or did she read it in the papers along with the rest of us? Minister, for how long has the Prime Minister known of the existence of this sealed indictment?</span>

I obviously cannot comment on unsubstantiated media reports about sealed documents that have been discovered, because, quite frankly, all of that was news to me this morning as well. But I can tell you that the Australian government is not aware of any charges by the US government against Mr Assange. Our embassy in Washington continues to closely monitor developments. Mr Assange remains in the UK, awaiting the outcome of his appeal to the UK Supreme Court regarding his possible extradition to Sweden. We continue to monitor closely Mr Assange's legal situation and have sought and received assurances from Swedish authorities that he will be accorded due process if he is extradited. While Mr Assange was detained in the UK in 2010, Australian consular officials provided him with a high level of consular support. This remains available to him, as we have advised his lawyers on a number of occasions. I understand that officials were last in contact with Mr Assange's lawyers in late January 2012.</span>

That is more than can be said for anything the opposition has put forward. The entire carbon price package is included in the midyear review, the MYEFO bottom line, and that also shows the budget returning to surplus in 2012-13. We have been very upfront with Australians as to the cost of the Clean Energy Future package, far more upfront than those opposite, who continue to obfuscate and mislead people about the true cost of the policy that they are now advocating, contrary to the one they previously had.</span>

I am certainly not going to get into any speculation about how those updates might occur. I am sure the senator will have the opportunity to consider the government's figures post the announcement or the bringing down of the budget, which I would say again will be a surplus budget, unlike the $70 billion black hole that his leader is leading him to. That is the reality. We have offset new spending and those opposite do notâ€” <span style="font-style:italic;">(Time expired)</span></span>

Given the European ETS is forecast to continue trading below A$15, isn't it highly likely there will be a multibillion-dollar drop in carbon tax revenue in 2015-16 when the shift to a floating price happens? And, given that the majority of spending under the carbon tax is fixed, as the minister admitted in her <span style="font-style:italic;">Sky News</span> interview on Sunday, won't this lead to a multibillion-dollar budget black hole? Isn't there just as much chance of the carbon tax havingâ€”to use the minister's own words from Sundayâ€”a very negative effect on the budget when this shift occurs?</span>

I know Senator Birmingham is desperately trying to demonstrate that he can mix it with the best and throw all these questions at the government, but, really, that was a question almost entirelyâ€”I will give him one creditâ€”based on speculation. It is true that I was asked about an earlier move to a floating price and my answer reflected the proposition I put in response to his primary question, which is that we have already paid for and costed the carbon package, the Clean Energy Future package, in the budget and the bottom line still shows a return to surplus in 2012-13â€” something those opposite, out of the mouth of the shadow finance minister, have already walked away from.

Why has the minister only been open about this risk when it allowed her to rebuff Mr Rudd's leadership plans?</span>

In relation to the current period of the fixed price, as I have saidâ€”and this will be the third occasion during this set of questionsâ€”we have reflected the cost of the policies, including the household assistance package, in the budget bottom line, which shows the budget returning to surplus in 2012-13. I would remind those opposite that their policy is to claw back the age pension increase and the increase to the disability support pension, to not give the tax cuts through the tripling of the tax-free threshold and to claw back the family tax benefit increases. That is coalition policy. In relation to what occurs in the 2015-16 year, we will account for that properly in the usual way, which is something you can never give a commitment to, because you refuse to cost your policy; you know it will cost more. <span style="font-style:italic;">(Time expired)</span></span>

This followed some $100 billion of savings across four budgets.</span>

We saw that in the last budget and we saw that again in the mid-year review. But, of course, the alternative is a series of unfunded, unaffordable, undeliverable promises from those opposite. The real story of what is happening in the coalition is that they are having to walk away from a surplus. They are having to walk away from support of the National Disability Insurance Scheme. They have had to walk away from tax cuts because they know they cannot balance the books. So, instead of properly funded, properly costed policies, they have come up with a new one. They call it an 'aspiration'â€”a budget aspiration; a policy aspiration that you kind of hope about but you never actually have to fund. That is what your election promise will be: an aspiration. <span style="font-style:italic;">(Time expired)</span></span>

Is the minister aware that Adelaide Brighton, a leading concrete manufacturer in her home state of South Australia, has recently announced a $2.7 million profit drop and has warned of future hits to its earnings attributed to the introduction of the Gillard government's carbon tax? Can the minister explain how the government can stand by its claim that the world's biggest carbon tax will not penalise South Australian industry and, therefore, send South Australian jobs offshore?</span>

                  </a>  The government has put together a substantial amount of assistance in the jobs and competitiveness package very much having regard to those industries that are trade exposed. There is a substantial amount of assistance for industries which are emissions intensive and trade exposed through the provision of free permits, which will significantly alleviate the effect of a carbon price. The good senator also asked about jobs in South Australia. I would say to him this: the coalition's policy is to drastically cut and end continued support for the car industry, which, as he knows, is very important to the economy of South Australia.</span>

                  </a>  I will take that interjection and I would make the point that South Australian senators who come in here and lecture the government on jobs in South Australia while backing in the coalition's ending of assistance to the car sector, really, have no basis on which to make such an assertion. They have no grounds to stand on and some people might even say there is a touch of hypocrisy in those who ask such questions. We are very conscious, as a government, of the importance of supporting jobs, which is why we have put in place a very substantial amount of assistance through the jobs and competitiveness package. <span style="font-style:italic;">(Time expired)</span></span>

Despite trade assistance, Adelaide Brighton is predicting a further net $5.4 million drop in profit in its first full year following the introduction of the carbon tax. How is the government planning to compensate the additional costs for every business in South Australia, particularly when the industry is already facing difficult conditions as a result of weakening demand, increasing labour costs and a high Australian dollar?</span>

We recognise also that many businesses will be able to pass on the price increase to consumers and that is reflected in the assessment of the appropriateness of household compensation. That is why we are providing additional assistance to Australian households, to reflect the fact that there will be some prices that will be passed on. I would remind the senator his party supports an increase in the company tax levy to fund the Paid Parental Leave scheme that the shadow cabinet does not support. I would remind the senator that his party supports a policy which will cost Australian families $1,300 additional tax, for which they will not get any assistance. So, if he really cares about ensuring that our transition to a low-pollution economy is managed sensibly, he certainly would not be supporting the position that Mr Abbott is proposing.</span>

Is the minister aware that Adelaide Brighton is planning on moving part of its clinker business offshore to mitigate the additional costs as a result of the government's carbon tax? What is the government's message to the 1,300 workers from Adelaide Brighton whose jobs may disappear as a direct consequence of this government's job-destroying carbon tax?</span>

That commitment is demonstrated by the fact there are 200,000 Australians in jobs who would not otherwise be had we followed the advice of the Leader of the Opposition. Our commitment is demonÂ­strated by the fact that we have put substantial assistance in our clean energy package to support jobs and competitiveness. Our commitment is demonstrated by the investment in skills that we know is critical to give Australians the tools to get the jobs not just of today but of the future.</span>

Food Standards Australia New Zealand gave evidence during a recent Senate estimates hearing indicating that the impending ban on the in import of orange juice concentrate containing the fungicide carbendazim was now under review due to lobbying from processors. This is despite a prior commitment from the government as recently as last month that it would ban the import of carbendazim in juice concentrate after the first quarter of 2012. Can the government please indicate how the so-called review of the ban on carbendazim in orange juice imports has progressed?</span>

I can inform the Senate that food safety and setting health limits for imported food falls within the responsibility of, as he has identified, Food Standards Australia New Zealand, FSANZ. Further, it is the role of the Australian Pesticides and Veterinary Medicines Authority to approve and register the use of particular chemicals in Australia. The APVMA is reviewing carbendazim and in the interim has suspended use on a number of crops including all citrus fruit. As a result of the suspension of carbendazim use the APVMA is currently considering removal of a number of maximum residue limits for carbendazim from the Food Standards Code, including that for orange juice, so that effectively a zero MRL will apply. I am also informed that at present no decision has been made by the APVMA on this matter or on a change to the MRLâ€”that is, while FSANZ conducts a risk assessment for imported products and engages with industry it is important to have industry consultation.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">At present Australia does not have a maximum residue limit in place but allows the presence of carbendazim in citrus products at 10 parts per million. The advice of FSANZ is that a 70-kilo adult would need to drink about 140 litres of orange juice in one day to consume an unsafe amount of orange juice with carbendazim present at this level and a child would need to drink about 40 litres in one day. However, the APVMA suspended the use of carbendazim on a range of crops, including oranges, in 2010. This was following a review in 2007 and was focused on the use of the chemicalâ€” <span style="font-style:italic;">(Time expired)</span></span>

The Australian juice manufacturing industry is heavily dependent on imported product. Unlike the United States, which is a net exporter of citrus juice, the Australian domestic market is only able to supply about 45 per cent of the needs of the orange juice industry.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">I again note for the Senate that FSANZ, the regulator in this area, has not raised any concerns about the presence of carbendazim in the fruit juice Australians are consuming. The APVMA, which deals with agvet chemicals, has an ongoing review in progress. It is consulting with FSANZ on this matter, but FSANZ is not aware of any test results in which carbendazim levels in orange juice have been above this safe level. <span style="font-style:italic;">(Time expired)</span></span>

What advice does the minister have as to the impact that has on Australian citrus growers, who are struggling after years of drought and now a high Australian dollar in competing fairly with these imports?</span>

It is worth going back to what I said earlier to the Senate, which was that a review is underway. The APVMA is reviewing the use of this particular chemical in the agvet area. The APVMA is considering the removal of a number of maximum residue limitsâ€”that is, MRLsâ€”for carbendazim from the Food Standards Code.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">But it is important to allow the process to run. They do have to consult with the industry. They do have to include risk assessment by FSANZ, which is the food regulator, and until that occurs there is a suspension of the product in Australia. FSANZ, on the other hand, has not raised human health concerns for imported product. But in respect of our domestic market, our domestic processors are heavily reliant on imported concentrate as the domestic market simply cannot meet its demand.

What we have always said is that, without a genuine deterrent such as the Malaysia arrangement, the boats will still keep coming. You can chalk down the negativity that you are now reflecting to Mr Abbott, because Mr Abbott can only say, 'No, no, no, no, no.' You wonder whether or not he would change his name to Nanette! Boats will continue to come to Australia unless the coalition is willing to come to an agreement with the government to deter asylum seekers from making those dangerous journeys. These latest boat arrivals, of course, are just further evidence of the consequences of the coalition's negativity. The government has been prepared to negotiateâ€” <span style="font-style:italic;">(Time expired)</span></span>

Today I announce the preferred tenderer for a new $300 million defence contract. That contract is for the repair and maintenance of the Anzac class frigates. The preferred tenderer is Naval Ship Management Australia, a joint venture between Babcock and United Group Infrastructure. The work will be based out of Perth. This contract is the first of what I trust will be many contracts reflecting a new approach. For too long local suppliers have complained about hand-to-mouth contracts. What we want to do is to provide incentives for long-term investment in Australian-based companies and Australian workers. This is a five-year contract which allows us to judge the performance and allows industry to invest in its own future with confidence. That is a good approach for industry, it is a good approach in terms of jobs, it is a good approach for the Navy and it is good for the taxpayer. This is consistent with the approach that the government is taking in all forms of procurement.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">We have long argued that, when it comes to buying Australian, we can simply not get enough. But that does not mean that we should buy Australian at any price or on any terms. What the government emphasises is that we are not in the business of accepting second best. What we argue is that we should reject the assumption that local industry cannot compete in terms of global competitiveness. We reject the notion, and the small-mindedness and fearmongering of those opposite. This is a country that can do great things, and, I think, we can build high-tech, high-wage, high-skilled jobs in Australian manufacturing. We want to ensure that all our people share in the prosperity that they all have a right to expect. <span style="font-style:italic;">(Time expired)</span></span>

This year it will spend more than $10 billion, and 54 per cent of that, $5Â½ billion, will actually be spent in Australia. So defence procurement is in fact vital for our manufacturing base in this country. It supports some 27,000 jobs. It builds skills in industrial capabilities and it generates spin-off innovations that benefit many other manufacturing industries.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">Today's <span style="font-style:italic;">Australian</span> tells us that Senator Carr was offered Senator Arbib's job and former foreign minister Kevin Rudd's job last week. Senator Arbib told the Senate today that he told the Prime Minister on Monday, 27 February that he was resigning. If this is the case, whose vacancy did Prime Minister Gillard have in mind? There must have been someone in mind to roll in New South Wales to enable the offer to be given effect to. Or was Senator Arbib really pushed, despite his assertions to the contrary?</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Minister Carr has confirmed the offer; Julie Gillard had denied it. Who is telling the truth?

Julie Gillard has egg on her face. It is business as usual.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">It was very interesting to hear Senator Arbib's response to Senator Brandis. I am sure, Senator Arbib, that you take away from this place a wealth of information. I have of course suggested that you write a book. As I said yesterday evening, I am sure it will be a bestseller. But perhaps now, Senator Arbib, that you are retiring, you could transfer your considerable parliamentary skills and return to our screens on a full-time basis. Many of our colleagues in this place would be unaware that, before becoming a powerful New South Wales right factional leader, and ultimately one of the faceless men, our Senator Arbib was a star of the small screen.</span>

And here is a photo of himâ€”even with hair! Here he is with a serious, grim, focused look.</span>

                  </a>  Senator Arbib, of course I am happy to table it. Here he is with a serious, grim, focused look; a prelude to the political bloodletting, cutting and thrusting which was to propel him to the heights of New South Wales and national politicsâ€”but, as Senator Arbib allegedly gave Richo as his reason for leaving, he was 'sick of being covered in blood'. Anyone interested in seeing this, go to YouTube; I will give you the referenceâ€”clearly an omen for the current soap opera of unhappy political families that have become a daily feature of Australian political life. The closing credits recognise Mark Arbib as playing the character called Freddie. Funnyâ€”the acting was something, Senator Arbib, that you omitted to mention in your maiden speech when you listed the many occupations that you held before entering parliament. Mark Arbib's career has certainly been stellarâ€”perhaps not quite in the same league as other former soapie stars, like Kylie Minogue, but he has certainly become a household name. It is interesting to note, Senator Arbib, that in your maiden speech you made mention of your grandmother's great disappointment when you told her you were running for the Senate. You stated:</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Small">She questioned why I would take a job that lasted only six years and suggested I consider taking a more secure job as a bank teller.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">Sadly for your grandmother, your job here lasted all of three years and five months. Perhaps, with hindsight, the bank teller job may have been a safer and more edifying career option.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Senator Arbib may tell us that he is leaving to help the healing process. Great sentiment, Senator Arbib, but all it means is that there will be one less faceless man. There may be one less, but they will remain in charge. The only way to restore hope, reward and opportunity is to go to an election. In the sentiment in which my contribution was made, I take the opportunity to wish Senator Arbib all the best in his new career. </span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Queensland</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">15:08</span>):  It is only Thursday, and groundhog day continues with this obsession on the other side of what is happening in our caucus. We had questions put to Minister Arbib from Senator Brandis about his desire to move on. Senator Arbib has legitimate reasons: he is a family man. I have seen his two young daughters and they are legitimate concerns and legitimate reasons for him to consider his resignation. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Without casting aspersions on the other side, let us have a close look at what happens in their caucus room. Just yesterdayâ€”as you know, Deputy President Parry, because you were thereâ€”they were crying over spilt milk, or was it a glass of cheap milk? No doubt there were other members who leapt to the defence of the particular senator who was under attack by those from other factions when their groupâ€”</span>

                    <span class="HPS-MemberContinuation">Senator FURNER:</span>
                  </a>  Why don't you pop your Alzheimer's pills, Senator Macdonald? I am not directing that at you; I do not think you take any pills. You seem a fit and healthy senator.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Then it was Senator Boyce's turn. She wanted to talk about the Rolls-Royce parental leave scheme that Mr Tony Abbott has proposed that will harm big businesses and jobs. There is no surprise in that, about harming jobs, because we know their record when it comes to jobs. When we on this side implemented the national stimulus package, we protected jobs in our communities. Up to 200,000 jobs were protected from the global financial crisis. And what did those opposite want to do? They wanted to oppose it, and they did oppose it in this chamber and in the other place to stop people being employed, to stop people having opportunities to sustain their employment out in the community. That is just a small snapshot of what happens in the opposition caucus: spilt milk and Alzheimer's pills. Put them together and what sort of concoction will you get? Who knows.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Let us talk about some of the other questions that were put to senators on this side in question time today, particularly on climate change. Once again we heard the climate change coalition sceptics complaining about what we are doing for the environment. If I reflect back a couple of years ago, some senators who are hereâ€”Senator Cameron and Senator Prattâ€”were on a climate change inquiry with me. We heard cold, hard facts and evidence from the likes of the CSIRO, from NASA and from over 1,000 top scientists globally about why we need to act on climate change. Senator Cameron was well informed, along with the rest of us, including the now Parliamentary Secretary for Defence, Senator David Feeney, about why we need to act on climate change. Yet those opposite, the climate sceptics, buried their heads in the sand, like they always do, and denied it. What does Mr Abbott say about climate change? Doesn't he call it 'absolute crap'? It is fitting to use that sort of language, given the language that was used in the coalition's caucus yesterday, with some senator being called an 'f-wit'. This is the type of opposition that wants to gain government at some stage in the future. Let us hope that never occurs, because that is their style. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">When it comes to the opposition's style, we know their position on policy and legislation in this place. It is a vacuum of empty cupboards. There is one word they are consistent with, though, and that is no: 'No, no, no'. They are consistently putting that position forward to present their case on how they wish to look after our great nation. But we are going to look after our nation. This government will make sure that at least nine out of 10 citizens will be assisted. Households will have permanent assistance as a result of pension rises of $338 a year and singles up to $510 a year. And that will be indexed as well.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I want to spend a little bit of time on the issue of what the coalition is going to do, conversely. They want to take back $1,300 a year from families as a result of what their policy will provide. In doing that, they will have their $70 billion black hole and they are going to have to run into severe deficit for a number of years. Where are they going to get that money from? Are they going to get it from pensioners? Are they going to rip it out of other areas where people need it the most? Are they going to rip it away from single mums and single householders that need that money the most? Surely that is the position they will come to. <span style="font-style:italic;">(Time expired)</span></span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">The coalition's argument against a carbon tax is simple, has always been simple and can be said in one sentence: the carbon tax is not in our national interest, certainly not now. We argue that only when a sufficiently comprehensive group of our major trading partners, particularly those countries that are, like Australia, energy-rich, trade exposed nations such as Canada, Russia and Brazil, commit to a price on carbon will it be in our national interest to do so. The coalition has argued that from the beginning. If Australia acts unilaterally, it will not change the environment, it will not change our weather and it will not change the climate at all. It is a very simple argument, and has been from the word go.</span>

That is the lie that this government should be pinned on.

In the end, if we act fundamentally unilaterally it will destroy our economy and our way of life, and other resource-rich, trade exposed countries will take advantage of our leverage, our legislation and our carbon pricing. In the end, that is Labor's great failure. Only when this debate matures to the level where the Labor Party finally understands that we rely on the rest of the world to act will the government finally come to some sense, but I am not holding my breath.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">New South Wales</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">15:19</span>):  Through you, Mr Deputy President, I assure those in the gallery that there is usually a far more serious debate in this place than they just heard from Senator Fierravanti-Wells. Here we are in a period where the global financial crisis is still destroying jobs around the rest of the world, where the US and Europe are trying to deal with huge problems, and what do we get? We get an absolute comedy routine from the opposition. Senator Mason's response was not much better; that was merely a comedy routine as well. If you know the coalition's policiesâ€”and I use the plural because you never know what their policy on climate change will be from one day to anotherâ€”you will know that the coalition adopted a price on carbon to go to the last election that John Howard fought and lost. John Howard was arguing for a price on carbon.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Since people are showing things around, I will do a little advertising here. I picked up a book today called <span style="font-style:italic;">The Australian </span><span style="font-style:italic;">M</span><span style="font-style:italic;">oment: </span><span style="font-style:italic;">H</span><span style="font-style:italic;">ow </span><span style="font-style:italic;">W</span><span style="font-style:italic;">e </span><span style="font-style:italic;">W</span><span style="font-style:italic;">ere </span><span style="font-style:italic;">M</span><span style="font-style:italic;">ade for </span><span style="font-style:italic;">T</span><span style="font-style:italic;">hese </span><span style="font-style:italic;">T</span><span style="font-style:italic;">imes</span> by George Megalogenis, one of the key economic commentators and writers in this country. He describes how John Howard dealt with climate change. He says that John Howard was a climate change chameleon: he changed whenever it suited him from one position to another. It is not just John Howard who is a climate change chameleon; the coalition are also climate change chameleons. They change their position whenever they think it suits their political position.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">This is what George Megalogenis said about John Howard in this book, which was launched today and which I recommend everybody get a copy of to see the truth about the Howard government's position. In January 2007, it says, John Howard offered $10 billion for a federal takeover of the Murray-Darling without consulting Treasury for advice on the numbers. Those great economic managers over on the coalition side offered $10 billion and they did not even go to the Treasury to ask what it would mean and what it would do. So that puts the lie to the argument of economic responsibility on the other side. He said in June that he became a convert to a market based mechanism to deal with climate change after receiving his own report written by Peter Shergold, the head of the Prime Minister's department. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">If you do not know, Peter Shergold is highly respected around the place. He was one of the key advisers to John Howard and he wrote a report that said we should put a price on carbon and it should be based on a carbon emissions scheme. John Howard promised a domestic emissions trading scheme, a cap-and-trade system, beginning no later than 2012. We heard all that nonsenseâ€”and the chameleons were at it again over there. He said for years he had argued against Australia moving before anyone else in the regionâ€”and now he wants to go first! This is John Howard. He wanted to go before anybody with a price on carbon, as Australia had done with tariffs. 'Australia will continue to lead internationally on climate change,' he said, 'globally and in the Asia-Pacific region, not in a way that lectures and moralises but in a way that builds support for global action to meet the enormous challenge of climate change.'</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">That destroys the argument Senator Mason was putting up that the coalition are acting responsibly by not moving on climate change. The coalition's own report, the Shergold reportâ€”and anyone from the coalition who stands up after me will have to deal with the Shergold reportâ€”says you have to act early to deal with climate change because climate change is real; climate change is what your grandkids are going to be living with in the future; we have to deal with it, and the most economically responsible way to deal with it is by putting a price on carbon. These lunatics do not realise that. <span style="font-style:italic;">(Time expired)</span></span>

                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Senator IAN MACDONALD</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Queensland</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">15:24</span>):  I listened very intently to Senator Cameron's contribution. It followed the lines of Senator Wong today in question time, applauding and lauding the carbon tax that is going to be imposed upon all Australians and send every Australian's cost of living up. Senator Cameron, if it is so good, why is it that your leader, the leader of the Labor Party, the current Prime Ministerâ€”this week, anyhowâ€”promised before the last election that there would be no carbon tax under a government she leads? If it is so good, Senator Cameron, please explain to me why your Prime Minister, your Labor leader, promised to the Australian public, hand on heart, that there would be no carbon tax under a government she leads?</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I want to return to the carbon tax shortly. But this debate started with reference to Senator Arbib's imminent departure. I wish Senator Arbib well. I did not have a lot to do with him, but I thought he was one of the more competent Labor ministersâ€”not that that is great praise for him. I wish him well in the future. I do not know what Senator Arbib is going to do. Some suggest he might be joining up with his old mates Mr Eddie Obeid and Mr Eric Roozendaal from the New South Wales Right of the Labor Party. I understand they have had business dealings before. Perhaps they are going back into those business dealings. In fact, I just googled on my iPad a rather interesting article by Kate McClymont in the <span style="font-style:italic;">Sydney Morning Herald</span>â€”not a paper I usually read in Queenslandâ€”that made a very interesting connection between Senator Arbib, Mr Obeid, Mr Roozendaal and Mr Williamson, from the Health Services Union, who is very prominent at the moment. There is a sort of winding up of what seem to be business interests there. So I wish Senator Arbib well, and I hope that he enjoys life outside of parliament.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I want to return to the carbon tax debate that was mentioned in question time today. Let me read you a passage from <span style="font-style:italic;">Hansard</span>:</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Small">Let us deal with a few facts. Let us have a scientific debate about climate change and its potential impact on the tourism industry. Globally, aviation contributes just two per cent of greenhouse gas emissions but eight per cent of world GDPâ€”that is, 28 million jobs and $US3 trillion. Recently, the less than august Australia Instituteâ€”an organisation for which I have no respect because it seems to pride itself on belting low-income people in Australiaâ€”proposed a carbon tax, an elitist tax, on domestic flights and called for an end to the promotion of the aviation industry. Never mind that, according to the Australian Greenhouse Officeâ€™s National Greenhouse Gas Inventory, civil aviation contributes just 0.9 per cent of Australiaâ€™s emissions. If we got rid of the entire aviation industry, as the Australia Institute would have it, we would still be left with 99 per cent of Australiaâ€™s emissions.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Who said that? It was Mr Martin Ferguson, the current Minister for Resources and Energy. When he said that, back in 2007, he was the shadow spokesman on transport. Martin Ferguson is a minister who I think is reasonably competentâ€”again, that is not a great recommendation when you consider the ministers that we have. Martin Ferguson is sensible. There was Martin Ferguson saying what a ridiculous idea a carbon tax was. And yet, to Mr Ferguson's undying shame, he was one who breached the promise that the Labor Party would never introduce a carbon tax.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">In the north of Australia, which I represent, Airnorth has just started a new direct service between Townsville and Darwin. It is a great service, but the cost is going to increase by $7 each way because of the carbon tax. Come 1 July, prices for airline travel all across Northern Australia will have to go up because of this ridiculous carbon tax, which will just add to the cost of living of all Australians.</span>

                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Senator LUDLAM</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Western Australia</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">15:30</span>):  I move:</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Small">That the Senate take note of the answer given by the Minister for Tertiary Education, Skills, Science and Research (Senator Evans) to a question without notice asked by Senator Ludlam today relating to Mr Julian Assange.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I recognise that Senator Evans was sent in here for question time in his representational capacityâ€”this matter is not in his portfolioâ€”but what a remarkable response I received from him. I asked whether the Prime Minister knew of a sealed indictment against Mr Julian Assange which has been made by a secret grand jury in the United States. We do not have the grand jury system in Australia; there are very few jurisdictions that still have grand juries. However, we need to learn a great deal about it.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">What the Prime Minister sent Senator Evans in to question time with by way of a brief was remarkable. I have been foreshadowing that I was going to ask questions about Mr Assange all day. I told the press gallery this morning that I was going to ask the these questions of the Prime Minister, and I foreshadowed them in the MPI discussion earlier today. The first question was: what does the government know about this attack on the democratic rights and citizenship entitlements of an Australian? The answer that came back through the brief given to Senator Evans was vacant and ambiguous, and that is a perfect description of the Australian government's response to these matters over more than a year. When is the Australian government going to step up and do its job?</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The Prime Minister of the country did not necessarily know, Senator Evans told usâ€”although he did not directly engage with the substance of my questionâ€”whether or not such an indictment existed. So, even though some ex-State Department guy in Texas running a little intelligence organisation apparently knowsâ€”his knowledge has been revealed in an email which was one among a drop of five million emails from Stratforâ€”the Australian government apparently does not. Or maybe it does; that is what we are seeking to find out.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Mr Burton, who is the former deputy chief of counterterrorism at the US State Department and who is now the vice president of intelligence at Stratfor, turns up in a large number of this drop of five million emails. His Australia Day message for Australia in 2011 was:</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Small">Not for Pubâ€”We have a sealed indictment on Assange. Pls protect.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The 'we' that he refers to is the US government. If our government knew of this, why weren't we told? If the Prime Ministerâ€”or perhaps the Foreign Minister or the Attorney-Generalâ€”knew that the attack on Mr Assange was coming, why wasn't the information shared with the Australian people? Why wasn't it shared with me at any time during the interminable series of questions on notice I have asked and the freedom-of-information requests that I have lodged to try to assess exactly what the game is and how deeply involved and implicated in it the Australian government is? Some conspiracies turn out not to be theories at all.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The second question I put to Senator Evans was whether the Australian government had any intention of taking any action whatsoeverâ€”anything at all; name one thingâ€”to protect against the very real threats now being levelled at this journalist, Mr Assange, who works for a publishing organisation. In a short time I will test the Senate's views on whether it agrees that Mr Assange is indeed a journalist and that the WikiLeaks organisation is a publishing organisation. There is a motion on the <span style="font-style:italic;">Notice Paper </span>which I invite senators who are with us this afternoon to take a quick look at. It does not call on the Senate to do anythingâ€”heaven forbid!â€”but to recognise that Mr Assange is indeed a journalist, as the British High Court and the Walkley Foundation have done.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The Prime Minister, through the minister's vague and ambiguous answer this afternoon, did not seem to indicate that anything at all had been done. Here is an idea: call in the United States ambassador. That is why the United States ambassador is here in Canberraâ€”to keep the flow of communiÂ­cation open about matters of relevance between states, particularly between allied states. I have not had much luck in my request to meet with the ambassador; maybe it will jump a little bit higher up the to-do list after todayâ€”we will see.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The third thing I asked the Prime Minister was whether she plans on taking any action and whether the government would perhaps stop obstructing my freedom of information requests and put some material on the record. Let us know, because the Australian government in this matter will turn out to have been either complicit or ignorantâ€”either we have been kept in the dark or the government has been keeping secrets. The Prime Minister and the rest of the cabinet may think that the rest of this information will be disclosed when they are good and ready. Perhaps it will be disclosed along with a story of somebody killed in action as a result of the wiki-drop. The existence of such a story has also been disclosed in the email drop, so perhaps the strategy now is to wait until the appropriate time and then tell the world public through the world's media organisations that there has been a death and that it is Julian Assange's fault and then to move to unseal the indictment. What a breathtakingly cynical strategy that would be!</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I think it is time that the government put some material on the record, becauseâ€”you know what?â€”you may not get to do it at a time of your choosing. Who knows what material WikiLeaks has on your cabinet and on what the Prime Minister knows. We will find out one way or another. Please, Prime Minister, take the lead and release this information. <span style="font-style:italic;">(Time expired)</span></span>

                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">The Native Title Amendment (Reform) Bill (No. 1) 2012 is the second iteration of Native Title reform proposed by the Australian Greens. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">The Bill seeks to address key failures of the Native Title Act 1993 (NTA). We want to provide meaningful rights and a basis for economic and community development to Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people. Something the Act has failed to do in the 18 years since it came into force.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">By introducing this Bill and any further reforms we intend to contribute constructively to a debate about native title reform that can ultimately lead to simpler legislation which produces more meaningful outcomes in a more timely fashion for all those involved.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">In March 2011, I introduced the Native Title Amendment (Reform) Bill 2011. The Bill was referred to the Senate Legal and Constitutional Affairs Standing Committee in May last year. Over 35 submissions were received, from a range of stakeholders and government agencies during the course of the inquiry. The majority of these were supportive of the intent of the legislation â€“ many noting the great need for the Native Title Act to be reformed. The submissions contained many useful suggestions on how the Bill might be strengthened and improved.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">This new Bill builds on those suggestions. We have closely examined the submissions and incorporated numerous revisions, creating a more robust and effective piece of law.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">In the original Bill we sought to address some of the 'low-hanging fruit' of native title reform â€“ by targeting some of the areas of native title law where relatively simple amendments could have far-reaching implications for addressing some of the current barriers to effective native title outcomes. In this Bill we have chosen the most important and most urgent of those areas and drafted amendments which we hope will gain broad support.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">We are still committed to incorporating aspects of the United Nations Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples into the Native Title Act. We are currently exploring the best way to do this and intend to introduce another Bill later this year.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">As I said when I introduced the original Bill, if we do not work together to traverse the "impenetrable jungle"<span style="color:gray;">1</span> that is native title litigation, there is little hope for just outcomes for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander peoples. The second reading speech for the original Bill is still relevant for this current revised Bill:</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">... nearly two decades after the introduction of the NTA it is clear that native title has failed to deliver on its promises.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">The Preamble states that â€¦</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">"The people of Australia intend:</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">(a)Â Â Â to rectify the consequences of past injustices by the special measures contained in this Actâ€¦ for securing the adequate advancement and protection of Aboriginal peoples and Torres Strait Islanders; and</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">(b)Â Â Â to ensure that Aboriginal peoples and Torres Strait Islanders receive the full recognition and status within the Australian nation to which history, their prior rights and interests, and their rich and diverse culture, fully entitle them to aspire."</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">We hope that by the time we reach the twentieth anniversary of the NTA in 2013, the process of native title reform will be seriously underway, and we will be able to see native title delivering on some of the seemingly forgotten promises contained in the preamble to and objects of the NTA.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">In practice, the people who the Act recognises and describes as "â€¦the most disadvantaged group in societyâ€¦" as a consequence of the dispossession of their lands, have had to rely on one of the longest and most complex pieces of Australian legislation to try to "â€¦secure their advancementâ€¦" and to recognise and protect (not establish) their pre-existing rights.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">In nearly two decades since its introduction, only a handful of native title claims have been resolved, with many of these being in remote areas which had been of little interest to European colonists. For the majority of our Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people, particularly those in urban areas and regional centres, native title has offered little and delivered less.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">Meanwhile the promised complementary measures have also been a grave disappointment â€“ the land fund has only been able to help out a limited number of communities, and the social justice package never eventuated.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">It is clear that in the application and judicial interpretation of the NTA a huge gap has emerged between these original promises and intentions, and the on-the-ground experience of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander communities seeking to have their native title rights recognised and protected.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">Justice Kirby characterised the barriers to the recognition of native title rights as comparable to an impenetrable jungle, saying:</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">"It would be easy for the judicial explorer to become confused and lost in the undergrowth to which rays of light rarely penetrate. Discovering the path through this jungle requires navigational skills of a high order. Necessarily, they are costly to procure and time consuming to deploy. The legal advance that commenced with Mabo v Queensland, or perhaps earlier, has now attracted such difficulties that the benefits intended for Australia's Indigenous peoples in relation to native title land and waters are being channelled into costs of administration and litigation that leave everyone dissatisfied and many disappointed." <span style="color:gray;">2</span></span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">There are many who still believe that the recognition of rights to land, culture and resources through native title could provide a strong and sustainable basis for 'advancement' by underwriting and enabling community and economic development.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">The former Prime Minister Kevin Rudd, for instance, spoke of the capacity for respect for native title to provide a sturdy foundation for durable economic and social outcomes in his Apology speech.<span style="color:gray;">3</span></span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">It is a tragic shame that neither his government nor its successor have done anything to seek to strengthen and facilitate recognition of the native title rights of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Australians to help make that vision a reality. Instead the only changes to native title laws we have seen in these two terms of Labor Government have been those that either diminished native title rights or at the very least have failed to enhance the capacity of traditional owners to participate in securing meaningful outcomes.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">This of course comes on the back of over a decade of Coalition Government under John Howard that systematically wound back the rights of Indigenous Australians, diminished native title rights, and saw the scrapping of all the existing avenues for representation and decision making with the removal of ATSIC.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">The challenge for this government in moving forward to make the vision of the apology a reality is to put aside the paternalism of the Howard/Brough years and to actively engage Aboriginal communities in policy development, decision making and community development instead. This also means recognising, as the Cape York Land Council put it, that "[m]eaningful respect for native title as a valuable property right is part of the solution â€¦ not an impediment"<span style="color:gray;">4</span>.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">

                    <span style="font-weight:bold;">The impetus for reform</span>
                  </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">The impetus for this bill arose from the interactions with Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Australians and native title experts that took place in and around the 2009 inquiry of the Senate Standing Committee on Legal and Constitutional Affairs into the Native Title Amendment Bill 2009. A Bill which in and of itself had little to do with reforming native title to deliver better outcomes.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">The discussions that took place around that Senate inquiry crystallised many of my long-standing concerns with the NTA which lead to a continuing dialogue on broader native title reform that has ultimately led to these reforms.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">At the time of the introduction of the first 2009 bill, the Attorney General Robert McClelland stated that the intent of the Australian Government in introducing the bill was "â€¦ achieving more negotiated native title outcomes in a more timely, effective and efficient fashion"<span style="color:gray;">5</span>.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">The vast majority of the evidence tended to that Senate inquiry supported the need for native title reform that would achieve more effective native title outcomes in a more timely and resource efficient manner but disagreed with the Attorney General's suggestion that the Government's reforms came anywhere near achieving those outcomes.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">As Tony McAvoy of the National Native Title Council put it at the time:</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">"â€¦the amendments that are proposed in this amendment bill are not controversial. They may make some small difference but they are not going to make any vast change in the way in which native title matters are dealt with. There is not going to be any rush of settlement of native title applications as a result of any of these amendments."<span style="color:gray;">6</span></span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">The submissions to that inquiry identified a number of other possible reforms to the NTA that promised to address the barriers to timely and meaningful native title outcomes and went beyond the narrow agenda of the government's first 2009 bill. These included addressing the 'burden of proof' through a rebuttable presumption of continuity<span style="color:gray;">7</span>, strengthening the requirements for parties to 'negotiate in good faith', and raising the threshold on extinguishment, among others.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">Many of the issues raised in this inquiry were further discussed and developed in the Native Title Report 2009 of the Australian Human Rights Commission by the then Social Justice Commissioner, Tom Calma. This report made an important series of recommendations for native title reform, many of which have provided the basis for the reforms proposed within this bill.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">I note that this bill does not cover all of the reforms recommended by Tom Calma, and includes a number of measures that he did not discuss at the time. While many of the good ideas can be attributed to Mr Calma and to others, I take full responsibility for the way they have been interpreted as legislative amendments. I commend the work of the former Commissioner and thank him sincerely for his efforts.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">I would also like to thank the native title experts, Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander organisations, land councils and representative bodies that have contributed their thoughts, ideas and comments to us in response to our inquiries and as part of the consultation process we undertook around the discussion paper and draft amendments proposing these reforms.</span>
                </p>

                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">This item seeks to improve procedural rights over offshore areas for native title holders. In doing so it seeks to address the contradiction between the existing provisions of subsection 26(3) of the NTA (that limits the right to negotiate to acts that relate to a place on the landward side of the mean high-water mark) and the fact that native title rights have been recognised to exist in offshore areas.<span style="color:gray;">8</span></span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">This amendment is consistent with the views expressed by the then Attorney General Robert McClelland, who stated in 2009 that:</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">"When it comes to behavioural change, I accept that the Australian Government has to lead by example. I believe we are doing just that. For example, last year I announced that the Government will take a more flexible approach to recognising native title in Australia's territorial waters. The Australian Government now accepts that native title can exist out to the limits of the modern territorial sea, generally 12 nautical miles from the territorial sea baseline. Given that the Government is involved in all claims over offshore waters, this approach should help bring about more negotiated settlements."<span style="color:gray;">9</span></span>

                  <span class="HPS-Small">The limitation of procedural rights under subsection 26(3) that denies traditional owners a right to negotiate over future acts in offshore areas is clearly inconsistent with this recognition that native title can exist up to 12 nautical miles out to sea, and so item 2 of the bill remedies this by repealing subsection 26(3) to remove this unnecessary contradiction and allow traditional owners the right to negotiate over acts that impact on their sea country.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Small">The future acts regime plays a crucial role in the manner in which traditional owners are able to exercise their native title rights, by governing the requirements placed on parties negotiating agreements concerning proposed activities. There has been sustained criticism of the manner in which the future acts regime has led to protracted and uncertain outcomes, and calls for the act to be amended to create stronger incentives for beneficial agreements and to achieve greater procedural fairness by striking a better balance between native title and non-native title interests.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Small">Currently the burden of proof for proving the absence of good faith in negotiations is on the native title party, rather than the proponent of a proposed future act. This appears procedurally unfair as it is in effect the proponent who is effectively asserting that they have negotiated in good faith for the required period when they apply for a matter to be taken to arbitration.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">

                  <span class="HPS-Small">The NTA as it stands prevents parties from resorting to an arbitral body, such as the National Native Title Tribunal, for a period of six months from the issue of a notice that the government intends to grant a mining tenement. This fixed negotiating period does not take into account the relative scope or difficulty of the proposed negotiations â€“ it is the same irrespective of whether the parties have established previous agreements or are meeting for the first time, and irrespective of whether they are negotiating a single act or attempting to conclude an overarching agreement on a 'whole of claim' basis.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Small">So on the one hand, parties who are undertaking complex negotiations in a genuine attempt to make efficient use of their time and resources to secure wide-scale agreements over large areas of land and multiple future acts need to do so within the six month limit (irrespective of the number of negotiations and the lack of resources of the native title representative body). On the other hand, proponents who are not inclined to enter into serious negotiations with native title holders can effectively stonewall and sit on their hands for six months, knowing they can then force the matter to arbitration without any requirement to demonstrate they have made all reasonable efforts to come to agreements.</span>

                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">To this end item 3 of this bill substitutes a new paragraph 31(1)(b) which requires parties to negotiate in good faith for at least six months and to use all reasonable efforts to come to an agreement about the conditions under which each of the native title parties might agree to the proposed future act. As made clear in the evidence to the Inquiry, this provision does not limit the ability of parties to reach agreement within 6 months but it does require negotiation for at least 6 months before either party can apply to the Tribunal.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Small">The good faith negotiating requirements are one of the few legal safeguards that native title parties have to protect their native title interests under the NTA. While section 31 of the NTA seeks to oblige the parties to negotiate in good faith during the negotiating period, in practice it is virtually impossible for claimants to establish that a proponent is not acting in good faith. This is borne out by the decision of the Full Federal Court in the matter of FMG Pilbara v Cox<span style="color:gray;">11</span> - a decision which substantially watered down the right to negotiate, to the extent that any negotiation in which the native title party cannot demonstrably prove bad faith is effectively considered to be a good faith negotiation.</span>

                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">Item 4 strengthens the requirement to negotiate in good faith by including explicit criteria for the type of negotiation activities that are indicative of good faith and clarifies that deceptive or unsatisfactory conduct is not a perquisite to demonstrate a failure to negotiate in good faith. Furthermore, it places a requirement on the arbitral body to consider the financial resources, and in the case of the native title party, the demands of cultural and religious practices, when considering whether a party has negotiated in good faith.</span>
                </p>

                  <span class="HPS-Small">Item 7 reverses the onus of proof so that the party that is asserting good faith is the one that is required to prove it, by inserting a new subsection 31(2A).</span>

The new section 47C provides that in the case of National, State or Territory Parks, extinguishment is to be disregarded. Given the nature of national parks, it is appropriate for the non-extinguishment principle to apply and to allow for the co-existence of native title rights and interests. Chief Justice French has used the example of the vesting of a nature reserve on Crown land as one act which could be determined to have extinguished native title, where it would make sense to be able to disregard extinguishment and provide for an agreement between the traditional owners and the state to recognise native title rights in the interests of managing that reserve.<span style="color:gray;">12</span></span>

                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">Section 47 of the NTA provides a model for coexistence of native title and other rights on pastoral leases. The new sections in item 13 are consistent with the current application of the NTA, and allow the existing coexistence provisions to be extended to nature reserves and allow extinguishment to be disregarded by agreement in a wider range of circumstances.</span>

Instead it seeks to freeze culture in some pre-colonial past, which defines traditional culture based on a snap-shot of cultural practices at the time of European settlement and an expectation that they should continue unchanged. This ignores the fact that by their very nature the cultures of Australia's first nations were geared towards adapting to and surviving in an often harsh environment, not to mention the substantial efforts and resources expended by successive governments aimed at forcing or encouraging changes in behaviour.</span>

In practice, the policy decision to narrowly interpret continuity and traditional practice under section 223 in the Yorta Yorta<span style="color:gray;">19</span> case has created a situation which directly contradicts the original objects of the NTA â€“ in that it means that there is no opportunity to raise the role of past injustices in the interruption of cultural continuity in an Act whose every intent is to provide remedy to those injustices.</span>

                  </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">As with our previous bill, the reforms contained in this legislation put forward clear and specific measures to address a number of key areas of interest to native title claimants.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">They address the barriers claimants face in making the case to demonstrate their pre-existing native title rights and interests and they tackle some of the procedural issues within the future acts regime that restrict the ability of native title holders to assert and exercise their native title rights.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">As we stated before, native title has the potential to play an important role as a basis for the economic and community development of those of Australia's first peoples who have been able to maintain their connection to their traditional lands and culture in the face of dispossession.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">It is clear that the original intention of the Parliament was that the Native Title Act would 'rectify the consequences of past injustices' and secure their 'adequate advancement and protection', however, it is equally clear that in its application this complex area of law has failed to deliver on those hopes.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">The strong relationship of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander peoples with their land and sea country should provide a firm basis on which to strengthen their culture and build their future. To make this happen, native title reform is needed.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">The Native Title Amendment (Reform) Bill (No. 1) 2012 is an important first step on that path â€“ I commend it to the Senate.</span>

Perhaps there is some misconception that it is an attempt to compel the Senate to take a particular view or to compel the government to take a particular action. I would like to note that this motion, No. 666, says that the Senate notes that the Senate notes that Australian citizen Julian Assange has been recognised as a journalist by others. It is a fairly simple and straightforward expression of facts that other institutions and entities around the world recognise this individual as a journalist. </span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">I am not asking the Senate to acknowledge that he is a journalist; I am asking us to acknowledge that these entities consider him as such and, for some reason, the parties have been unable to agree to even that. He has been recognised by and received awards from the following entities: the Australian Walkley for Most Outstanding Contribution to Journalism 2011; the Queenâ€™s Bench Division of the British High Court ruling of 2 November 2011; the Martha Gellhorn Prize for Journalism 2011; the Italian International Piero Passetti Journalism Prize of the National Union of Italian Journalists 2011; the Spanish JosÃ© Couso Press Freedom Award 2011; the Spanish Voice of the West Freedom of Expression Award 2011; and the Amnesty International UK Media Award 2009.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">These institutions have recognised Mr Assange for what he is, a journalist, and Wikileaks for what it is, a publishing organisation. Therefore they are protected by the First Amendment to the United States Constitution, and perhaps then he will not be dropped into a hole at Guantanamo Bay or somewhere that we do not even know the name of. As for doing the job of a journalist, I will perhaps try again with a motion that is even weaker and see if senators could support that.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I would like to acknowledge all the mothers, fathers, adoptees and family members who are in the galleries today. Some have for the first time shared their experience of their forced adoption with the committee and the community. I know how much it took for them to do that and what a toll it has taken. I would also like to quote from a mother who wanted her name withheld. She said:</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Small">I'd lie in bed every night with my arms wrapped around my baby inside of me knowing that I would never hold him after birth. I'd feel his feet and hands through my own stomach as he moved around, knowing that I wasn't ever going to feel them after he was born. I'd talk to him and tell him that I would find him again one day and that I and his father loved him and always would. I'd pray to God every night for him to send [someone] to get me out of there and show me a way to keep my baby, but no one did. I'd think of running away, but where would I run to, who would I run to.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">That typifies so many of the stories that we heard from women who thought they could do nothing else but not consent. People did not always consent, but nothing else was going to happen than having their baby taken.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">On behalf of the committee, I acknowledge and sincerely thank the mothers, fathers, adoptees and family members who contributed to this inquiry and shared their accountsâ€”and these were accounts, not stories, of their experience; that was very clearly said during the inquiryâ€”as I said, sometimes for the first time. These accounts had a profound effect on committee members and, I am sure, on all who heard them.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">It is undoubted that past policies and practices have caused great harm and hurt to mothers, fathers, adoptees and their family members. You cannot come to any other conclusion when you are listening to the evidence. We received hundreds and hundreds of submissions, we spoke to dozens and dozens of witnessesâ€”not everybody, because we just could notâ€”and we received thousands and thousands of pages of submissions and evidence. We also had access to national archives and archives from various government departments. The evidence tells the accounts of mothers and fathers who were pressured into giving up their babies by their families, institutionsâ€”both state and territory and private institutionsâ€”social workers, doctors, nurses and those who they rightly expected to help them. There was evidence of consent not properly taken. There was evidence of coercion. All the pressure, practices and policies have had lifelong impacts on mothers, fathers, adoptees and family members.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">To the adoptees I would like to say: we know that your mothers did not abandon you. You were not thrown away. This is what we have received evidence about as well: the babies who were adopted, who are now adults, felt that they had been abandoned. Mothers have told us that they do not want their now adult children to feel that. I quote from the report:</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">The committee received evidence from hundreds of women who gave birth in hospitals and other institutions between the late 1950s and the 1970s. Overwhelmingly, these women alleged that laws were broken or that there was unethical behaviour on the part of staff in those institutions. The common failings included applying pressure to women to sign consents, seeking consent earlier than permitted by the legislation, failing to get a consent signature or obtaining it by fraudulent means, and denial of reasonable requests, particularly for a mother to have access to her child. As explainedâ€”</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Small">certainly after new laws were enacted in the mid-1960s, actions of these types would in some cases have been illegal. Other experiences that reflected unethical practices included failure to provide information, and failure to take a professional approach to a woman's care. It is time for governments and institutions involved to accept that such actions were wrong not merely by today's values, but by the values and laws of the time. Formal apologies must acknowledge this and not equivocate.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The committee believes that governments and institutions need to take a more credible approach to the former forced adoption practices. The committee does not express a view on any particular cases or on the prevalence of illegal or unethical actions, but apologies that deny them altogether lack credibility in the face of the weight of evidence. The committee agrees that official apologies should also identify the key wrongs that vulnerable mothers were not given the care and respect that they needed during this difficult period of their lives, that mothers were poorly advised, that they were stigmatised by professionals and institutions and that organisations and their staff in positions of authority stood in judgment of these women instead of respecting them.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The committee recommends that the Commonwealth government issue a formal statement of apology that identifies the actions and policies that resulted in forced adoption and acknowledges, on behalf of the nation, the harm suffered by many parents whose children were forcibly removed and by the children who were separated from their parents. The committee recommends that state and territory governments and non-government institutions that administered adoption should issue formal statements of apology that acknowledge practices that were illegal or unethical as well as other practices that contributed to the harm suffered by many parents whose children were forcibly removed and by the children who were separated from their parents.</span>

                    </a>  The committee concludes that the government and institutions in the 1960s and 1970s were presented with a range of professional advice about adoption. Little of it challenged adoption as a practice; however, a great deal of it cautioned against placing pressures on mothers to encourage the surrender of babies for adoption, and some of it explicitly drew attention to the requirements of the law and the risks of it being violated. The evidence presented to us also shows that adoption should not have been treated as inevitable. We recommend that official apologies should include statements that take responsibility for the past policy choices made by institutions, leaders and staff and not be qualified by reference to values or professional practice during the period in question.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I am going to run out of time to address all of the 20 recommendations that are contained in this report. It also refers to the need for a national framework to address issues of reparation around the provision of professional support and counselling services, access to data and grievance procedures. I urge every member of this chamber and the community to read the report. I would like to specifically acknowledge in the time I have available the very hard work of my fellow committee members. This was a really, really hard inquiry. It was a very emotional inquiry. You could not help but take to heart the stories of the people, many of whom are in the gallery today. I would also very strongly like to thank the work of the committee secretariat: Dr Ian Holland, Dr Tim Kendall, Mr Gerry McInally, Ms Janice Webster and Mr Tim Hillman. These people went above and beyond the call of duty in order for us to get this report finished, particularly as our committee has a very heavy workload. We wanted as a committee to do justice to the accounts and experiences of the mothers, the fathers, the adoptees and the families who gave us so much evidence. For us, the evidence is overwhelming. The damage caused by these past policies and practices is overwhelming. It happened.

                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Queensland</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">16:04</span>):  Thank you, Mr Deputy President. To the people in the gallery, to the people who are listening to this and to the people who have given us their lives, this is your report. Take it, read it and be proud, because none of this would have happened without each of you who have given us the incredible honour and the responsibility of putting on paper and putting into the community knowledge your histories.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Five years ago in my office in Brisbane, three women came to see me. They brought some pictures and a couple of books that they had written, and they brought their pain and their anger and their disgust, because no-one had believed what had happened to them. I was sitting listening to them at that time and I personally could not believe that in my country, in places that I knew, to people with whom I had worked, the experiences that they told me about had happened. In some ways, I was a bit fortunate because I live in Brisbane, and the first formal acknowledgement of the work that had happened and the horror that had occurred was made by the Royal Brisbane and Women's Hospital, a hospital I knew well. I think it is important that we recognise here that a number of people over the last five years have begun to formally acknowledge the horrors that occurred in our community.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">That is not to say that people did not know beforehand. No-one can pretend that what appears in our report was completely unknown in this country. It was known. Either it was ignored or it was explained away that the way these women were treated was somehow for their good. They were looking toâ€”and I quote this with great emphasisâ€”'the best interests of the child'. When I heard the women who gave evidence to the inquiry, and when I heard particularly the children of those women who gave evidence, I could accept that some people in the past thought that they were acting in the best interests of the child. However, I challenge those people now, wherever they are, whatever their values base was and whatever their explanations were, to ask those children: was it actually in the best interests of the children, who had no choice? Was it actually in the best interests of the mothers, who were in some casesâ€”and I do qualify it by saying 'in some cases'â€”given no choice? Was it actually in the best interests of the fathers, many of whom could not come to our inquiry because they did not know what had happened?</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">So often we found out during the process that fathers were dismissed and the knowledge that they were going to be parents was kept from them. In many cases the mothers and fathers were separated, but my particular horror was the fact that in many cases they were threatened with the law of the day so that if the mother gave the name of the father and they were under age their whole freedom, their legal record and their chance to have any future were all threatened. That they would know they were going to have a child was a risk.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">What we have been able to do in this place is important, but it is only the first step. Sometimes, in the wonderful job we have in the Senate, we can be part of something that has real potential to change lives and to change our community. I think today is one of those days. We can share in the Senate with the people for whom it is most important an opportunity to take a step forward. We have 20 recommendations. They will go through the processes and go to governments. However, the key aspect is that the history of what happened in our country, what happened to women, what happened to men and what happened to the childrenâ€”who are now adults but I say at this stage 'the children'â€”over a long period of time will now be known and acknowledged.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">One of the most poignant moments of our whole inquiry was when a woman stood before us and said: 'I just want to make sure that my child knows that I loved him. I want to make sure that he'â€”she had found out through the system that her child had been born and was a boyâ€”'knows that I did not give him away.' Every family deserves to know their own history.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Different senators will talk about different things and this discussion will go on, but I want to talk about knowing who you are and knowing that you have a birth certificate that indicates who you are. One of our key recommendations in this report is that people be able to seek and have true documents of identificationâ€”I almost gave a little clap there as well. I am not negating the role of adoptive parents. I am not negating the role of adoptive families. However, every person in this country has the right to know exactly who their birth parents are. There needs to be a genuine proof of identity for all purposes in our country. One of our key recomÂ­mendations in 2012 is that that documenÂ­tation should be available anywhere you live in this country. It should be there so you know who your mother was and who your father wasâ€”if that is known. People know, when original birth certificates are issued, there is no way you can separate a mother from a child. When a woman gives birth anywhere in this country at any time, you can have no mistake about who has given birth to a child. That is something we can certainly achieve in 2012 through the registry process and across the different areas.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I know that people will read this report. Sometimes you write a report in this place and you know it is going to go onto a shelf and someone will look at it in the future or it will be on some kind of record. I have no fear that people will read this report because of all of youâ€”you will make sure that people read the report. What we need to do together, though, is move forward with the recommendations. Senator Siewert has pointed out clearly that we need to ensure there is a national apology to every one of you: the mothers, the fathers, the children, anyone who was adopted and all the people who were caught up in this horror of our history. We now can say that it is a horror of our history and not pretend that it did not happen. We have also said that that kind of knowledge should be entrenched in some way so that people outside the immediate community will know what happened. We are going to rely on everybody to see what is the best way we can do that.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">There will be things that need to happen such as trained professional support for all of those who have been damaged by the process. There needs to be an acknowledgement in our history that this happened. There needs to be consideration for what the people who have been hurt need to have in their own lives, and we need to ensure that people can find one another and if we can help in any way.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I put on record as well my acknowledgement of the secretariat. We have a document here that, perhaps for the first time, looks at what happened as the rules were changed in our country about adoption and adoptive processes.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I say to all of you that this has changed so much in my own life. I say to all of you: I am sorry. I am sorry for your hurt; I am sorry for your pain. I have been made stronger by hearing of the lives you have led and I want to work with each of you into the future to make sure that we have effective processes for people who have been so damaged and so hurt for so long.</span>

                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Queensland</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">16:13</span>):  The report of the Community Affairs References Committee entitled <span style="font-style:italic;">Common</span><span style="font-style:italic;">Â­</span><span style="font-style:italic;">wealth contribution to former forced adoption policies</span><span style="font-style:italic;"> and practices</span> is a unanimous report from the Labor Party, the Greens and the coalition. We worked very hard to achieve this outcome because this is such an important issue. It was not an issue where there should be any dissent. I add my thanks to those of Senator Siewert and Senator Moore: the people who travelled to be here today, all the submitters, the many dozens of people who appeared as witnesses and particularly the secretariat, who really did go above and beyond. When you get emails that are timed at 1.45 am from people trying to get drafts exactly right so that we could be here to release this report today, you know they are caring just as much as we are. There are, as we have said, 20 recommendations in this report, and seven of those 20 specifically deal with apology. They set out not only who should make formal apologiesâ€”the Commonwealth, the states, the territories, the organisations, the hospitals and the institutions that were involved in the forced adoption industryâ€”but also how to make them. We thought this was very important. It is perhaps not uncommon now for general apologies to be made to people who have been harmed by behaviours of the pastâ€”but there are apologies and there are apologies. It is very important to acknowledge that, whether you think people were doing what they thought was the right thing at the time, you know it was not the right thingâ€”to acknowledge that people need reparation, they need redress, to get on and to move on from the issues.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This inquiry took us 18 months. We started in November 2010. We were intending to report much earlier than this but there were the sheer volume of information, the type of information and the need to, in most cases, have a community forum. We had nine hearings; we went to every capital city and in most cases we had a community forum as part of our inquiry system. It was so important to give as many people as possible the chance to tell their story. As Senator Siewert said, there were a lot of people who had not told their story until this inquiry was held, and many found it very helpful to be able to give their account of what had happened to them.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Before we started this inquiry I knew of five people, three of them within my extended family, who had been affected by what I now call forced adoptions. It was not a term I had even thought about, and thank you for giving me that opportunity. Since we have started this inquiry, it is not just the hundreds of submitters but people who you meet in everyday life who tell you that this happened to them. I was even talking to an adviser to a senior politician yesterday and she said, 'My mother was one of those people' She has an older sibling that they cannot find.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Perhaps my first experience of the problems of forced adoption was a woman who worked for me many years ago. This was just on the cusp of the internet and she was looking for her son whom she knew had been adopted to the UK. She was 17 when she became pregnant with him. She put that child up for adoption because her parents told her to, but she went on to marry the father and have two more children with that man. She was looking for the full brother or sister of her existing children, and it was something that got to her every day. She said: 'I was 17 and my mother said to me, "Come home without that thing or don't come home at all". I did not know what to do.' So she came home without 'the thing'. Luckily, she had repaired her relationship with her mother, but she had not at that time found her son.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">In some ways that is a mild form of the stories that we heard around forced adoption. There were so many more violent stories about people being literally held down, being drugged and being smacked across the face in front of policemen. As Senator Moore said, some were threatened with their partner being jailed for carnal knowledge if they were to reveal his name, even though the two of them were teenagers together. Even amongst all of this, we cannot claim that we did not know what was going on, and there was quite a lot of evidence that we received around what was known at the time about what was the right way to go about it. I would like to quote briefly from Marie Coleman, who I think is probably well known to many people here as a great advocate for women. She said:</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">We had a situation where women who became pregnant outside of a marital relationship fundamentally had three options. One was a shotgun wedding, one was an illegal abortion and one was adoption. There were no benefits or supports to enable women to keep their children with them. When one looks at some of the other literature â€¦ the state of orphanages and children's homes through the 1940s, 1950s and 1960s was pretty shocking.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">She was dead right; it was pretty shocking.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">As we have said before, this inquiry is about forced adoption. We attempted to flesh out and tease out some of the reasons why adoption became, I guess, the flavour of the decade. Adoptions in Australia peaked in 1971 and 1972. There were 9,798 adoptions in 1971-72. Last year there were 412. That gives you an idea of how we got very excited about adoption and how we have learned some of the lessons about the problems with adoption. Forced adoption is defined as meaning 'adoption where a child's natural parent or parents were compelled to relinquish a child for adoption'. So we are not talking about situations where an adoption may have been willingly entered into knowledgeably and in an informed way by people who did genuinely consent to having their child adopted, whether they were married or not. We are talking about where people were forced into the situation.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We talked also about the area of knowledge that was held at the time and the types of accounts that we have. The Royal Women's Hospital, for instance, has been criticised at some length in our report. We did not do this because we think it was a particularly bad example but simply because we have quite a lot of evidence from people who were affected by what happened at the Royal Women's Hospital. Perhaps I should clarify: it is an awful example but it is no worse than many, many others and perhaps better than some. We had a lot of evidence about it. The Royal Women's Hospital had 5,000 adoptions between 1940 and 1987, and we have significant evidence from some of the people there. Yet they could say in a report that they found 'no evidence of illegal practices' at the RWH and 'no evidence of hospital-wide policies that discriminated specifically against single mothers'. We go on to outline nine witness accountsâ€”and there were many more that we could have usedâ€”which would suggest that there had been policy-wide practices and that there was knowledge at the time about the brutality of what was happening. One nurse who worked in the Royal Women's Hospital in the 1960s and 1970s, who has apologised herself, said:</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">Yes, we had taken babies from their mothers at birth, without them holding or even seeing their child. The mothers were then admitted into wards without their babies and ostracised in many different ways, finally being discharged about 1 week later â€¦ I felt very sorry for what I had done even though at the time we believed what we were doing was "right" for the child and the mother. However I now believe that the process was very cruel, unjust and very dehumanising to both mother and child.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">These are eyewitness accounts that the Royal Women's Hospital could use to perhaps re-examine the idea that they could find no evidence that forced adoption practices occurred in their hospital in the fifties, sixties and seventies. I hope that what our report does is add to what should already exist: the legitimacy of these eyewitness accounts of the treatment that went on not just of the women but of their children and the fathers of those children.</span>

                      <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Senator CAROL BROWN</span>
                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Tasmania</span>â€”<span class="HPS-MinisterialTitles">Deputy Government Whip in the Senate</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">16:23</span>):  I rise today to speak on this very important inquiry by the Senate Community Affairs References Committee into the Commonwealth contribution to former forced adoption policies and practices. This inquiry has been a very emotional and traumatic journey and has involved a large number of personal stories which would have been very difficult to share. I would like to place on record my thanks and appreciation to all those people who have recounted their painful stories. Many of these stories had not been told before. You have all made a personal sacrifice, but it is a sacrifice that means your experiences can no longer be ignored. I would also like to acknowledge that, very understandably, some women found giving evidence too distressing and have yet to tell their story.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Since the beginning of the inquiry in November 2010, the committee has received hundreds of individual submissions and submissions from organisations, including boxes and boxes of archival material. Also obtained was a range of additional information, correspondence and answers to questions placed on notice with witnesses. A range of documentary records were also used. The committee held 10 public hearings and visited every capital city except Darwin. I will talk particularly about the hearing in my own home state of Tasmania a little later on. I would like to give my sincere thanks to the committee secretariat for their support and research for this important inquiry. Their hard work is evident, I believe, in the quality of the final report.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The term 'forced adoption' is as cruel as it sounds. For a period of time from the late 1940s up until, in some cases, the late 1980s, single mothers were made to give up their babies. This fact is indisputable. They were forced to do this through a range of different means, including being coerced, being drugged, being tricked into signing adoption papers or being physically shackled to beds. I think I can speak for all members of the committee when I say that the pain these young women must have experienced, and still continue to experience, is unimaginable for those of us who have not been through it.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">As evidenced by the stories told in the report, these women were also treated appallingly throughout their pregnancies by the very institutions that were meant to be caring for them. There are allegations of unethical or even unlawful practice. In some cases doctors, nurses, social workers and midwives showed no respect to these frightened and often very young women. There are also descriptions of poor medical treatment being provided to these mothers during the birth, with medical staff taunting them about their unwed status and not providing proper pain relief or proper treatment. Some of the behaviour towards these mothers can only be described as unethical. One of the mothers who made a submission recalls:</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">I was treated inhumanely. A nurse even told me the pain I was experiencing was punishment for getting pregnant before marriage. I was ignored and left alone with the contractions until the birthing began. I had no idea what to expect. They shouted at me, and then pushed a gas mask onto my face. They made comments about me, but didn't talk to me at all.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">To add to the pressure being exerted to adopt their child out, vital information was also withheld. Single pregnant women were not told of the social security benefits available to them were they to keep their baby; they were pushed towards adoption as their only legitimate choice. Added to this, many families sent women away to unfamiliar surroundings with no family or friends for support. Once babies were born, the 'clean break' theory on many occasions was implemented. The 'clean break' theory meant that mothers were often denied the right to hold or even see their child before it was taken away. They were given drugs to dry up their milk, their breasts were bandaged up and they were not told the gender of their child. When they asked to see their babies they were told it was in the best interests of their children that they were sent somewhere else and they were selfish to not want the best for their child.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">At the hearing in Hobart I heard one of the mothers describe her experience in the hospital in an eloquent and powerful way. She said:</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">They created an unbalance of power: the power of hospital staff was lined up alongside that of married prospective adoptive parents who wanted a babyâ€”my baby. Staff allegiance was to them, not to me. They did not hear or see me. I was nothing and no-one. I was in a place where I was supposed to be cared forâ€”hospitalâ€”but I was ignored. I was guilty of nothing, yet I was made to feel ashamed, guilty, inferior and bad.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The Salvation Army representative at the hearing in Hobart also supported these descriptions. He spoke of recalling the great distress of mothers in hospitals at not being able to see their babies and of mothers not recalling signing consent forms and not being able to revoke the consent even within the legal consent period. Many, I have to say, never knew that revoking consent was even an option.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Many more similar stories were told. We heard that the ripple effect from these forced adoptions is huge and includes the mothers, their children and some of the nurses and social workers who look back on the practices with anxiety. We heard firsthand from mothers how the ongoing trauma of having their baby forcibly removed is still impacting on their lives. They also spoke of the successful and unsuccessful attempts to reunite with their children who were taken away and the anger that many of the children who were adopted still felt. The former chair of the joint select committee of the Tasmanian parliament that looked into adoption between the years of 1950 and 1988 told a story of a 17-year-old woman who had a loving supportive boyfriend and a grandmother she lived with and who was going to look after the baby so the girl could resume her work and study. Despite having all this, the baby was forcibly adopted because she was unwed.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">In light of these practices that I have just outlined and the many submissions made to the inquiry, the report handed down today outlines some very clear recommendations. Perhaps the strongest of these recommenÂ­dations is the call for the Commonwealth to issue a formal statement of apology that identifies the actions and policies that resulted in forced adoptions and that acknowledges the harm suffered by the many parents and children who suffered from forced adoptions. This is because, despite adoption coming under individual state and territory jurisdiction, the Commonwealth is the only body that can legitimately encompass the states and territories in an apology, and the report finds it cannot completely absolve itself of responsibility.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Related recommendations advise that the apology should include statements that take responsibility for the past policy choices made by institutions' leaders and staff and not be qualified by references to values or professional practice during the period in question. The report also states that this apology should be presented in a wide range of forms and be widely published. There is acknowledgment of the other apologies that have already been made, such as the apology from the Western Australian state governÂ­ment and a handful of other institutions, and the recommendation that other state and territory governments and non-government institutions that administered adoptions should issue formal statements of apology. The development of a national framework through the Community and Disability Services Ministers Conference to address the consequences of forced adoption is also a recommendation.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Other recommendations are about ensuring greater access to records, making these searches easier, and that any institutions that hold records have the undertaking to identify all records and make the information available. The report also recommends that the Commonwealth commission an exhibition so that the experience of those affected by forced adoption practices are documented and not forgotten.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Finally, I would like to note that there is a recommendation that the Commonwealth establish as a matter of urgency affordable and regionally available specialised professional support and counselling services to address the specific needs of those affected by forced adoption as well as the establishment of Commonwealth funded peer support groups. Due to the lack of records, we cannot accurately say the number of forced adoptions that occurred in Australia, but we can estimate that the figure is many thousands. It is made very clear in the report that the practice of forced adoption was wrong, not just by today's values, but by the values and standards of the time. This report cannot change what happened, but it can go a small way towards recognising and righting the wrongs of the past.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I would like to extend my gratitude to all those who shared their accounts with us. It is only through hearing your stories that we can properly understand and acknowledge the practice of forced adoption. It will enable all Australians to know your stories, to understand the wrongs that were carried out on young mothers and young fathers and their children and that these unethical practices shattered lives and did happen. I commend the report to the Senate. I think a fitting way for me to conclude is by using the poignant words of one of the mothers who gave evidence to the inquiry. She said, 'Last but not least, I want people to know that I loved my baby, that she was wanted, and that I am her mother.'</span>

                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Victoria</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">16:34</span>):  Between the 1930s and the 1970s, there were about 10,000 babies adopted in Australia each year. In 1971 there were 9,798 adoptions. Twenty years later, by 1991, this had declined to a little over 1,000, and in 2006 a little over 500. Today the average is about three per every 100 live births. Something just does not add up.</span>

                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The Senate Community Affairs References Committee report, <span style="font-style:italic;">Common</span><span style="font-style:italic;">Â­</span><span style="font-style:italic;">wealth contribution to former forced adoption policie</span><span style="font-style:italic;">s and practice</span><span style="font-style:italic;">s</span>, is a massive report. The issues have been complex and we have worked with a large volume of evidenceâ€”and it has been a privilege. The committee heard 418 submissions, many from individuals and others from organisations. The accounts received by the committee dated from the 1950s to as recently as 1987. The reports were very detailed, including a large number of accounts that clearly outlined that babies were taken for adoption against their mother's will.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Many women told us they were pressured, deceived or threatened in order to secure signatures on adoption consent formsâ€”actions that were likely in breach of the policies and laws of the time. For many mothers, their experiences were harrowing. The accounts were very personal and traumatic for the mothers and the children involved. According to the Royal Women's Hospital, up to 45 per cent of Victorian unmarried mothers relinquished their babies for adoption between 1945 and 1975, a period often referred to as the 'heyday of adoption'â€”and many of these were forced. The dilemma facing the single mother was exacerbated by community attitudes and social values that embraced adoption as the solution to illegitimacy and infertility, and failed to provide viable alternatives.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">As a result of the strong community interest and media coverage in this story and the number of submissions, we have taken 18 months to get today. I particularly thank the committee members, who worked extremely hard. Some of them cannot be with us todayâ€”and I think particularly of Senator Judith Adams and Senator Coonan, who both contributed to the production of this report. We also considered archival material from the 1950s to the 1970s and worked to shed more light on the Commonwealth's role in past adoption practices. We investigated the roles of the states and territories and the adoption information laws. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Nobody has the right to take a child from its mother. What happened in hospitals throughout Australia was wrong. Most of the 400 or more submissions heard by the committee were harrowing tales of regret, abuse, neglect and loss. People out there may be thinking, 'Not all children who were adopted had a harrowing experience,' and they are right. Given the thousands of babies who were adopted, the committee was not looking for and did not get submissions from happy families. We had a clear reference to look at, talk about and expose forced adoptions. Still, the practice was and remains misguided. Thousands of babies were taken from their mothers, and while there were probably many who had very ordinary childhoods, when you take a child by force or coercion you change a life journey. In many cases you take a part of the mother's soul, and you take the child's heritage. There is loss. I would like to briefly tell two stories of women who had their children taken without consent. Both women were from regional towns in New South Wales, just over the border from Victoria where I am from.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">About 45 years ago, Joan discovered she was expecting a baby. She had not realised how babies were made, and when she told her boyfriend he ended the relationship. This was not unusual. In fear and trepidation, she gave her parents the news and asked if, with their help, she might keep the baby. They quickly organised a hospital appointment in Melbourne and she was very clearly told that it would not be possible for her to keep the baby. By the time the baby was born, Joan had a new boyfriend who was courageously prepared to accept the baby as his own. Sadly, the grandparents and the hospital refused to allow it. The baby arrived; the boyfriend held her for a few minutes and the mother was given the forms to sign before the little girl was taken away. The couple were married and had two children of their own. No-one knew, including the couple's children.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Thirty years later, the child sent her mother a letter. She had been part of a loving family but her adopted parents had died and she was ready to learn about her own family history. After searching in Victoria for nearly 10 years, she thought to search the New South Wales registry and, with luck, the two names were connected. Sadly, Joan was very ill with cancer and she died just six months later. And I can tell you that there were some shocked whisperings in the Catholic Church that day when three children, rather than two, gave the eulogy.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">In this case, the little girl could easily have been raised by her mother. Before she died, Joan explained that the hospital forced her to sign the adoption documents. The social workers were of the belief that the obstacles facing single mothers were insurmountable and that she could not be sure the young man would marry her now that she had delivered a baby. She was told that adoption was the best possible solution and that it would allow her to 'get on with her life' and 'pretend it hadn't happened'. This position was supported by the nurses and unanimously upheld by her parents. Joan felt enormous pressure to 'do the right thing'. Explaining this to her daughter so many years later and with only months to live, she felt enormous regret. The loss had been so great that she had not known how to explain it to her other children, who were now adults.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The daughter has been closely following the committee inquiry. She might even be here today. I know that she feels an enormous sense of loss for the life she might have led. She wanted more time with her natural mother. She expected the adoption system would keep the details of her birth and make them accessible when she needed them. She felt let down that the details about her arrival were so difficult to find. She is devastated that the system did not support her request to find her mother sooner than she did.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">She still does not know anything about her natural father. There is nothing on the record. She does, however, have a brother and sister and a second chance to get to know the man who held her during those first few minutes of life.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The second mother had a relationship with a pilot towards the end of the Second World War. She was more determined than the first. She and the baby's grandmother travelled to Victoria to visit an ageing aunt, and they stayed for six months. When the baby was born, the mother flatly refused to sign the adoption documents. After much coercion, she finally agreed to sign a form that allowed the baby girl to be fosteredâ€”with an option to collect her later. The little girl was given to a foster family in Melbourne. They indulged her with love and kindness, opportunities and education until the natural grandmother decided it was time the child was returned to her mother. Sadly, the child was six.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">At 65, she often talks about the trauma, confusion and loss of losing her foster family and being handed to the nuns in black on a train at Southern Cross Station on a Sunday afternoon. She was taken to a small country town and given to a mother who was humiliated and a grandfather who would not own her. She would argue that she should have stayed where she was.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I expect that these stories are similar to many thousands of stories where the outcome was not as harrowing or as despicable as the tales we heard during the committee inquiry. Many are contained within the report. Each and every one of these Australians needs our sincere apologies and our acknowledgement. We need to acknowledge that, whatever the intentions and beliefs of the time, past adoption practices caused lasting consequences for many relinquishing mothers, and sometimes also for their children and their extended families. Irrespective of the mores of the time, the committee does not accept that it was legal or ethical to take a child from its mother for the purpose of adoption. </span>

                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Today we recognise that this action was both illegal and unethical. I understand that many relinquishing mothers experienced, and continue to experience, feelings of grief, pain, anger, helplessness and loss, and for this I apologise unreservedly.</span>

                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I would like to thank all the women and their children and all the professionals involved for telling us their stories. As the newest member of the Senate Community Affairs References Committee, I would like to thank the committee for its track record in bringing to light the issues of our nation, putting them on the table and exposing the things that we need to take a good, hard look at if we want to be serious about being true to ourselves as a forward-looking nation. It is a testament to the women involved on the committee. I commend the report to the Senate.</span>

                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">New South Wales</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">16:44</span>):  As someone who was not a member of the committee and was not able to participate in this inquiry, I would like to congratulate all on the Community Affairs References Committee and everyone who participated in the inquiry. This was an incredibly disturbing Senate inquiry and an incredibly powerful report, entitled <span style="font-style:italic;">Commonwealth contribution to former forced adoption policies and practices</span>. Only recently I became aware of the expression 'the baby scoop era', which is used to describe what has happened to these people. It is an awful expression, isn't it? It is quite visually challenging, the notion of wrenching a child from its mother's arms, but it is what happened, not just here in Australia but also in Canada, the US and the UK, and it was very much the method of the times. I have read many of the stories documented and I have read many of the submissions, and I am sure they are quite traumatising for everyone.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I have known other stories, personally, and I remember very vividly when I was growing up a young woman being sent to Brisbane. She left town as a wide-eyed, bright young thing and came back six months later distressed and depressed, and eventually she attempted to take her own life. At the same time, girls from an orphanage came to my school, and I remember a discussion in fifth form when one of the girls did not come back to school. There were lots of stories about what had happened to her, told with great fear and trepidation by her friends, and we were just gobsmacked that something like this could be happening. Not long ago, at a school reunion, the issue was raised again as three former classmates revealed to me something of the experiences of forced adoption within their families, which was really quite a shock to me.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">As we have heard from the other speakers, the inquiry has received horrible testimony to dreadful evidence. The callousness is gut-wrenching. That is what really comes through. The personal accounts that we saw, and the practices revealed, on the <span style="font-style:italic;">Four Corners</span> program this week really do attest to the courage of the women who are able to tell their story. They did that on behalf of those who could not, and I congratulate them for their courage and their grace.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">In 2002 there was a New South Wales parliamentary inquiry into adoption practices, where many similar stories were told of threats made, promises given and the sense of powerlessness and ensuing heartache. Dr Merryl Moor, at the beginning of her 2005 PhD thesis on the subject, to which she gave the title <span style="font-style:italic;">Silent Violence: Australia's White Stolen Children</span>, quoted Jigsaw, that fantastic organisation from Brisbane:</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">In relation to adoption the question needs to be asked: In what other period of human history did young mothers willingly defy nature and give away their babies en masse to strangers?</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">It was an unspeakable act of cruelty. We know when we speak of forced adoption that we are talking about something that is culturally imposed and, as we have heard from Senator Boyce, this is very different from someone who makes the tough decision to have a child adopted.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The work of the Community Affairs References Committee is exemplary and so potent and powerful. Since 2007 we have seen acts of injustice recognised. The apology to the stolen generations was, I think, a potent moment in the healing of the Australian psyche. The apology to the forgotten Australians, children raised in institutional care, also helped to ease the pain and hurt of lost childhoods and identities. Today, through this report, I do not just hope but know that we are giving hope to the thousands of young womenâ€”and in many cases their parents, families, partners and childrenâ€”who were forced to relinquish their babies that there can be some redress, some formal acknowledgement of their hurt and pain and some sense that governments, churches, communities and institutions were all wrong.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We all know that many of those involved in removing Aboriginal children from their homes did so in the belief that it was for the greater good. No doubt the same applies to those who thought adoption into a two-parent family was automatically a more desirable outcome than life with an unmarried mother. But the fact that a practice was followed in good faith does not necessarily make it right, and that is what we have heard today. This is the evidence, the culmination. The <span style="font-style:italic;">Four Corners</span> program showed just how much this weighed on the minds of social workers, hospital staff and, I am sure, many adoptive parents.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">In 1492, when 'Columbus sailed the ocean blue', as I remember it from my school days, one of the things he did when he got to America was to basically kidnap a Native American child. He later adopted him, had him baptised and called him Diego in order, he said, to save his immortal soul. It might have suited Christopher Columbus very well to have a local translator whom he could control, but I am also prepared to believe that he genuinely thought young Diego would be better off with him than with his own family. However, the sincerity of his belief certainly did not and does not justify the actions. The forced removal of babies in Australia may have been seen by many as an act of kindness intended to save those children from harmful environments but, just as in the case of Christopher Columbus, we know that is simply not good enough.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">What we have seen in this Senate report is nothing less than a catalogue of human rights violations, and that is the truth. These were violations of the rights of mothers such as the wonderfully outspoken Christine Cole, whose experience as a 16-year-old inspired her to research the issue and to write her doctoral thesis. It is difficult to convey to people living in a society that values and enforces an individual's civil and human rights what life was actually like 40 or 60 years ago for vulnerable young women who lacked knowledge, support and resourcesâ€”and, frankly, even for those who did not. Girls were not instructed about pregnancy, labour and delivery. Pregnant girls were hidden away or sent away, to the eternal shame of their families. They were isolated and not provided with information, as we have heard already this afternoon. In short, they were not recognised as legitimate mothers and, when their babies were forcibly removed, nor were they recognised as legitimate mourners.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The work of psychologists such as John Bowlby and Elizabeth Kubler-Ross has taught us a lot about love and loss and grief, and the pages of this report bring those psychological theories vividly to life. It is not only the mothers whose human rights were violated; so were the rights of countless children who were denied access to their natural heritage. I would use the term 'ill-conceived' to describe the practice of forced adoption. It was ill-conceived because of the absence of integrity and respect. These values are fundamental to how a society should work: integrity is being forthright, accurate and honest with all partners involved in decisions; and respect is recognising each person's right to autonomous decision making, or what some people call the ethic of self-determination. Adoption is a lifelong process, not a one-time event. When engaging in such a process the innate dignity of human beingsâ€”and this, of course, includes the childrenâ€”must be considered.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Columbus might not have realised this, but we do. The report makes it abundantly clear that human dignity was not a consideration in the case of these young women and their babies. The dominant themes were of raw emotionsâ€”betrayal, humiliation, condemnation, abandonment, trickery, grief and, of course, abject loss. The report brings great heartbreak into the light from the shadows of the pastâ€”the not too distant past. And although, as Senator Siewert has said, this makes harrowing reading, it is always a good thing when the truth is revealed, even when the truth is what psychiatrist Geoff Rickarby has rightly described as 'a stain on our history'.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Nothing can heal the experience of love and loss of these women, who carry it with them every day. But I sincerely hope that, through this report and the recommendations, we can help remove their sense of shame and restore their dignity and self-worth. My favourite poet, Leonard Cohen, would surely say of this report, 'Nothing's perfect, there's a crack in everything, that's how the light gets in.' I hope the light shines brightly.</span>

This is not an inquiry that I have been able to participate in but it is an issue I have followed closely over many years, having reviewed the Western Australian Adoption Act in the early 2000s. One of the issues that came to light then, and which still causes me distress, is the continuing existence of contact vetoes that are legally enforceable and have criminal offences attached to them. The idea that, in this day and age, we continue to criminalise the desire to contact your kin seems quite extraordinary to me.</span>

I am sorry you even had to ask for an apology because I think the evidence speaks for itself. I certainly apologise. I am truly sorry for your experiences. I would like to pay tribute to brave women like Sue Macdonald, who came to speak to me in my office in West Australia about her experiences and about the need for the Western Australian government to apologise. I am very proud of my home state for having moved that apology and having led the nation in that regard, and it is time for the federal parliament to follow suit.</span>

Frankly, we are still in danger of repeating many of those mistakes. Adoption acts are certainly much tighter today, and we do realise what an extraordinary thing it is to separate someone from their kin.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Time">17:01</span>):  During the adjournment debate on Monday 27 February, Senator Brown raised a point of order in relation to remarks made by Senator Macdonald. I undertook to review the <span style="font-style:italic;">Hansard</span> and consider the matter. Having done so, I consider that there was no point of order because there is no prohibition in the standing orders on referring to matters that are before committees.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">However, in the generalâ€”and I hope that people listen and understand that I am speaking in the generalâ€”I remind all senators that I have made several statements relating to a particular matter before the Privileges Committee and that I have warned senators against continuing to canvass those or related matters whilst they are before the Privileges Committee.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">All senators have a right to feel that any matter before the Privileges Committee that may concern them is dealt with in accordance with its well respected practices without any attempts to argue the case in the chamber. There is an issue of fundamental fairness at stake. I remind senators that privilege resolution 9, which enjoins senators to exercise the great privilege of freedom of speech responsibly, refers specifically to the damage that can be done by allegations made in parliament and to the need for senators to have regard to the rights of others.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Whilst it is not my intention to constrain the rights of individual senators to debate, within the <span style="font-style:italic;">Standing Orders</span>, matters of their choice in the chamber, it is clearly my intention to honour the spirit of privilege resolution 9. Therefore, as a matter of fundamental fairness, it is becoming intolerable to have contributions in the chamber refer to this matter whilst it is under consideration.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">There will be time, when the committee reports, for the Senate to consider the committee's findings and recommendations and for there to be a robust debate. I therefore seek the cooperation of all senators to desist from engaging in any further comments and remarks on this matter until the Privileges Committee reports. </span>

                  </a>  Mr President, your ruling is correct, and your quote on the matter is quite correct. But the Senate needs to reflect that, as far back as 1984, the Privileges Committee noted the possibility that the reputation of senators might be damaged if matters such as this were to continue to be raised. Damage to the reputation of senators was clearlyâ€”one has only to look at the <span style="font-style:italic;">Hansard</span>â€”an outcome of Senator Macdonald's contribution the other night. You are quite right, Mr President, to have called it to order and to have made a breakthrough ruling that it should not happen again.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The Privileges Committee's deliberations at the moment are unprecedented in that there has been no result despite the matter's having been referred to it some three or four months ago. That in itself, in my view, is a travesty, and I am sure that Senator Milne shares that view. Never should this chamber lend itself through its debate system to the sorts of repeated accusations that were earlier referred to the committee.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Your ruling is correct, Mr President, and I hope that it will be implemented in the future so that the behaviour which Senator Macdonald engaged in on Monday night cannot ever be repeated in this Senate.</span>

                  </a>  I thank the Senate. Mr President, the coalition accepts your ruling and understands the manner in which you have approached this. I might say it is fair and reasonable. I simply remind people listening in that those that complain about canvassing these issues should remind themselves that they issued media releases about this issue: for example, commenting that certain issues 'highlights the opposition's highly compromised position as accusers' or, on another occasion, 'We have absolutely nothing to fear from this fairly sleazy move'â€”statements in the media by the Australian Greens. When they want to attack the accusers, they do so publicly. Yet again it seems as though there is one law for the Greens and another law for everybody else.</span>

Mr President, in this game every now and then these things occur, but what is astounding in this matter isâ€”including the point of order that was raised previously by Senator Bob Brownâ€”and I simply say to the Australian Greens, that those that live in glass houses should not throw stones. Were the Greens stopped from talking about me when I was before the Privileges Committee? No. But should others be stopped when they are before the Privileges Committee? Yes, and that is the double standard.</span>

Secondly, Senator Abetz referred to media releases. What he did not say was that the media releases were in response to media releases and media coverage generated by Senator Abetz. Both in this chamber and outside on 6 July Senator Abetz put out lengthy press releases and chronologies which canvassed the matters which some months later became the subject of a reference to the Privileges Committee. Any media generated subsequently was in response to his attempt to beat up a story to besmirch the reputations of Senator Brown and me. I think it is important for anyone who is interested to realise that Senator Abetz on 6 July 2011 started the process in the media, and it was reported in Tasmania on the <span style="font-style:italic;">Tasmanian Times</span>.</span>

                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">Antarctica has a unique place in Australiaâ€™s national identity.  We are tied to Antarctica through our history, our geology and our climate.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">This year marks the 100th anniversary of the departure of the first Australasian Antarctic Expedition led by Sir Douglas Mawson.  Mawson stands alongside other giants of Antarctic discovery, like Scott and Shackleton, for his remarkable endeavours to explore Antarctica and claim a sizeable portion of the continent on behalf of all Australians.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">It was Mawson who established Australiaâ€™s first scientific research base at Cape Denison in Antarctica. Over the past century, Australia has built on that legacy, establishing a strong reputation for Antarctic science in areas such as climate change, conservation, astronomy and geoscience.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">Antarcticaâ€™s unique environment offers major opportunities for this scientific research.  The continent is recognised as a key indicator of global climate change.  Better understanding of Antarctic ecosystems, weather and climate is crucial to environmental protection in the region as well as understanding global climate trends.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">Australia has also become a world leader in Antarctic protection. We were one of the 12 original signatories to the 1959 Antarctic Treaty, which enshrines the principle of peaceful use of the Antarctic.  Fifty years on, the Antarctic Treaty remains a model for global cooperation. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">Australia actively engages in the international governance of the Antarctic. We played a key role in the development of the broader system of international arrangements for the region, known as the Antarctic Treaty system. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">Just two decades ago, former Prime Minister Bob Hawke worked with former French Prime Minister Michel Rocard to prevent mining in Antarctica. For the first time, we recognised that the last pristine continent on earth should remain untouched. The opportunity was nearly missed, but the decision changed the worldâ€™s way of thinking just in time.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">Their efforts led to the Madrid Protocol, which now protects the Antarctic environment, bans mining in Antarctica and designates Antarctica as a natural reserve, devoted to peace and science.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">In October this year, I was honoured to join Bob Hawke and Michel Rocard in Hobart to commemorate the 20th anniversary of that Madrid Protocol.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">We will continue to build on protections for this unique and special part of the world.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">This Antarctic Treaty (Environment Protection) Amendment Bill 2011 will amend the Antarctic Treaty (Environment Protection) Act 1980, which gives effect to our obligations under the Madrid Protocol and the Convention for the Conservation of Antarctic Seals.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">The Bill will align the Act with Australiaâ€™s new obligations in relation to three measures adopted under the Antarctic Treaty and Madrid Protocol, namely:</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">

                  <span class="HPS-Small">These Measures will establish more stringent arrangements to protect human and vessel safety in the Antarctic, and the Antarctic environment.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Small">1. providing the ability for the Minister to grant a safety approval, an environmental protection approval, and to impose conditions on such approvals;</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Small">2. implementing new offences and civil penalties regarding unapproved activities, activities carried on in contravention of the conditions imposed by an approval, and offences and civil penalties related to environmental emergencies;</span>

                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">As Australia prepares to host the 35th Antarctic Treaty Consultative Meeting in Hobart in June 2012, this Bill marks another chapter in Australiaâ€™s history of involvement in Antarctica and maintains our commitments under the Antarctic Treaty and Madrid Protocol.</span>

                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">I am pleased to present the Customs Amendment (Anti-dumping Improvements) Bill (No. 2) 2011, representing the second tranche of legislation implementing the Government's reforms to Australia's anti-dumping system. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">The package of reforms announced by the Government in June are designed to provide better access to remedies for Australian industry, and to ensure those remedies are available as quickly as possible. They aim to improve the robustness and transparency of anti-dumping decisions and introduce stronger compliance mechanisms. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">The elements of the reforms that I am introducing into the House today are focussed on improving the robustness and transparency of anti-dumping decisions. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">In particular, I am proposing a new appeals process to replace the existing mechanism, and provide more flexibility in seeking extensions of time during the course of investigations. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">This Bill also provides a legislative basis for the International Trade Remedies Forum, which met for the first time in August this year. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">These amendments were drafted in close consultation with the Office of International Law within the Attorney General's Department, and the Department of Foreign Affairs &amp; Trade, to make sure that they are consistent with Australia's international law obligations.</span>

                  </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">The Bill implements a number of changes to the process for appealing decisions of the Minister or the Chief Executive Officer of Customs and Border Protection. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">Presently decisions may be appealed to the Trade Measures Review Officer, who was an employee of the Attorney-General's Department. The Review Officer will be replaced by a 3-member review panel able to take on a greater case work load. Members of the Panel will be appointed by the Minister based on their relevant expertise. Panel members will no longer be an employee of the Attorney General's Department, so will be independent of government. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">The Government will make available resources in the form of administrative and research assistance, to support the effective functioning of the Panel. </span>

                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">Presently the Review Officer must accept an application for review, unless the applicant has failed to provide sufficient particulars of the findings to which the review application relates. This has resulted in approximately 80 per cent of Ministerial decisions being appealed to the Trade Measures Review Officer by one of the parties to the proceeding. The Government is proposing a higher threshold for appeal. Now, in order to initiate an appeal, the Panel will need to be satisfied that the applicant has established that the Minister did not make the correct and preferable decision. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">Presently there is a perception that International Trade Remedies Branch is conflicted in reinvestigating its own decisions. When the Review Officer reviewed a decision, the officer would recommend a reinvestigation to the Minister who referred it back to the Branch which reinvestigated and made recommendations to the Minister as to whether to overturn or amend the original decision. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">To address this, the Panel will now make recommendations directly to the Minister as to whether the original decisions should be affirmed, revoked or substituted. Where reinvestigation of a particular finding is required, the Panel will direct the Branch to reinvestigate that finding, and to report back to the Panel to inform their recommendation to the Minister. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">Parties will now be able to appeal the Minister's decision to continue or not continue measures, and also the Minister's decisions to vary or revoke measures (or not) on review. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">As part of the appeals process reforms, the Customs Act will be amended to allow for important stakeholder groups, such as downstream industry and trade unions to participate in administrative reviews. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">The changes to the appeals system allow for a more robust system which is better able to identify and process meritorious applications for review.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Small">Australia's anti-dumping system contains one of the shortest investigation timeframes in the world, at 155 days. At present only one extension to that timeframe can be sought, and it must be prior to the publication of the Statement of Essential Facts at day 110. This can mean that extensions, where required, tend to be for significant periods, to anticipate any possible further need for an extension. </span>

                  <span class="HPS-Small">The Minister will still have to approve all extensions of time. Implementation of this proposal will be carefully monitored to ensure it does not result in a blow out of investigation periods, and that extensions are only sought in complex cases, not routinely. </span>

                  <span class="HPS-Small">If you asked Australians if we should create a system where their health information can be easily transferred between their health practitionersâ€“ many would be surprised that such a system doesn't already exist.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">The sad truth is that our medical information is not connected â€“ despite how logical and possible it is to achieve.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">In many ways, the absence of a system of electronic health records in Australia demonstrates the difficulties of health reform â€“ the fragmentation, the vested interests and the balancing priorities.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">But we clearly know the evidence of why we need to act.</span>

                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">Currently health information of individuals is fragmented across a range of locations rather than being attached to the patient. Consumers need to retell their story each time they visit a different clinician. This outdated approach can result in poor information flows, unnecessary re testing, delays and medical errors.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">Studies in hospital environments have indicated that between 9% and 17% of tests are unnecessary duplicates.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Small">The National Health and Hospitals Reform Commission recommended to the Government in 2009 that "by 2012 every Australian should be able to have a personal electronic health record that will at all times be owned and controlled by that person"</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">This is a proposition that had widespread support in the extensive health reform forums and consultations that the Government held throughout 2009 and 2010 around Australia.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">Australians saw the value in preventing errors and misdiagnosis. They saw the benefits in managing their own health and the health of their family members. And they saw the benefits in creating a more efficient and effective health system.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">Our analysis shows that the net economic benefits of eHealth records are estimated at $11.5 billion until 2025. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">To put it bluntly â€“ there is widespread support for dragging the management of health records into the 21st century.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">That's why this Government committed $467 million in the 2010 Federal Budget to a two year program to build the national infrastructure for personally controlled eHealth records.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">Records will have the capacity to contain summary health information such as conditions, medications, allergies and records of medical events created by healthcare providers. The records will also be able to include discharge summaries from hospitals, information from Medicare systems and some information entered by consumers.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Small">Australians rightly do not want their privacy threatened. They do not want one single massive data repository for all their records. They also want the right to participate, but not be forced to do so. </span>

                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">

                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">It is how our system will strike the right balance between security and access. Many of these protections are about ensuring that patients have the same protections over the access to digital records that they do over paper based records. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">The bias is placed upon linking data sources around the country - much of which exists already in various forms in general practices, at the pharmacy, with pathology groups or at hospitals. This also means that we won't be building every technology solution â€“ but providing the national infrastructure that only the Commonwealth Government can do.</span>

                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">There's now 1.1 million of these identifiers downloaded â€“ across jurisdictions and lead implementation sites.</span>

                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">The implementation approach is both swift and careful. We are developing infrastructure in a set period of time, but the rollout will happen in a staged manner.</span>

                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">All through the process there has been extensive consultation with clinicians, consumers and the health IT industry.</span>

                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">The finalised Concept of Operations released in September is the result of much of this consultation â€“ but the engagement work now continues as the fine details are completed.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">This consultation is important because establishing eHealth records is not an end in itself. It has to deliver for clinicians and patients. This is why we have embedded e-health within our health reform agenda. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">We want to know what is going to work for the patients â€“ as well as the doctors, nurses, allied health professionals and others who have to deliver care.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Small">Now this legislation I am introducing today will deliver the legal basis for this new system from when it starts registrations from 1 July 2012.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">To develop this legislation we have had two rounds of public consultations â€“ both on the legal issues for the system, and then on an exposure draft version of this Bill.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">The central theme of our system and this Bill is that any Australian will be able to register for an eHealth record, and they will be able to choose the settings for who can access their record and the extent of that access. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">When registered, consumers may be represented by authorised and/or nominated representatives. This allows minors and persons with limited or no capacity to have an eHealth record which details their medical history. Patients can choose to have a carer, family member or friend assist them with their record. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">Apart from consumers, the other participants who can choose to register include healthcare provider organisations and repository and portal operators. </span>

                  <span class="HPS-Small">A registration framework will ensure regulation of all these parties, verification of identity, assurance that minimum technical, security and administrative requirements are met, and system accountability. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">The Bill prescribes the circumstances in which eHealth record information can be collected, used or disclosed and imposes civil penalties for knowing or reckless unauthorised collection, use or disclosure. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">All registered consumers and organisations will be subject to the Privacy Act 1988 or state or territory privacy laws as prescribed. The Privacy Act will also apply to the System Operator including the ability of the Information Commissioner to investigate an interference with privacy and to penalise an offending party. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">The Bill also sets out requirements which apply to protect the privacy and security of patient health information. This includes notification of data breaches and storing all information and in Australia. These requirements are also subject to civil penalties.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">The System Operator will be responsible for the operation of the system. The Department of Health and Ageing will initially perform this role. The Bill allows for the System Operator to change in future to a statutory authority. This will be the subject of future discussions, both with states and territories and with stakeholders. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">The System Operator will be responsible for establishing and maintaining the basic infrastructure of the system â€“ including a register of participants, index service for documents and national repositories where appropriate.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">There will also be important safeguards that the System Operator will deliver including audit logs for access to records, reports on the performance of the system and mechanisms for handling complaints.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">An Independent Advisory Council will provide expert advice on the operation of the system and on clinical, privacy and security matters.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">The membership will include consumers, health providers and people with experience in critical areas such as rural health, indigenous health, administration, technology and legal or privacy issues.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">A Jurisdictional Advisory Committee will include representatives of the Commonwealth, states and territories and will provide advice regarding their perspectives of the system. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">The Australian Information Commissioner will be the key regulator for the system and will have the capacity to conduct audits, commence investigations and impose a range of sanctions, accept enforceable undertakings and investigate complaints. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">To ensure transparency of the system, the System Operator and the Information Commissioner will be required to provide annual reports on the practical operation of the system to the Minister and the Ministerial Council. The system is to be reviewed two years after the Bill commences. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">This legislation being introduced is yet another sign that this Government is getting on with the job of rolling out eHealth records.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">This stands in stark contrast to the record of the Opposition in this area, and particularly its current leader. When he was the Health Minister he committed to establishing eHealth records. This of course didn't occur.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">He recalled in 2005 (and I quote):</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">"Failure to establish an electronic patient record within five years, I said, would be an indictment against everyone in the system, including the Government. I hope to be judged against that somewhat rashly declared standard; not because it is likely to be fully met but because it would mean that, come next year, I remain the Health Minister!"</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">Of course this was a standard that he failed, much to the detriment of patients and clinicians alike.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">However he failed a second test when in the lead up to the 2010 election, he promised that a Government he led would cut every cent of the $467 million that this Government had committed to eHealth.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">This legislation presents another test. Will he do what is the right thing for this country and support bringing our health system into the 21st Century, or will he continue his well trodden path of just saying no.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">For the sake of the future health care of Australians I hope that the Opposition can finally come on board.</span>

                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">Many people may see this system and legislation as being about technology. That's a mistake. It is about health care. It is about helping patients and doctors to prevent, cure and treat.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">It also builds upon the other advances that are happening because of this Government's investment â€“ namely the National Broadband Network and telehealth. Investments that are rolling out now and helping to better the lives of Australians. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">The use of technology to improve care will have a similar effect to the other great advances in health care technology â€“ such as antibiotics or x-rays. This is a once in a generation opportunity to deliver these important reforms.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">I encourage this Parliament to support this improved health care through the passage of this Bill.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Small">They will give greater flexibility to the operation of income management. For example, the refinements would allow the <span style="font-style:italic;">Vulnerable Welfare Payment Recipients Measure</span> to be activated on its own in a particular area, instead of in conjunction with the <span style="font-style:italic;">Long-term Welfare Payment Recipients Measure</span> and the <span style="font-style:italic;">Disengaged Youth Measure</span>, as is currently the case.</span>
                </p>

                  <span class="HPS-Small">A new external referral income management measure, known as <span style="font-style:italic;">Supporting People at Risk</span>, is being introduced. This will allow referrals from a wide range of State and Territory authorities on a similar basis to referrals under the current <span style="font-style:italic;">Child Protection Measure</span>, and will help ensure income management assists those people most likely to benefit.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">For example, to support the Stronger Futures in the Northern Territory alcohol measures, this Bill will enable people referred by the Northern Territory Government's Alcohol and Other Drug Tribunal to be placed on this new measure of income management, thus reducing the proportion of income available for alcohol. </span>

                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">SEAM is one aspect of the Australian Government's strategy to improve school attendance and engagement.

                  <span class="HPS-Small">School attendance in parts of the Northern Territory is unacceptably low â€“ as low as 40% in some schools. With such a level of absence, a child cannot build a sufficient foundation in literacy and numeracy to enable them to succeed in later schooling and in the modern world.</span>

                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">In four years we have made substantial progress in addressing shortages of early childhood services, teachers, teacher housing and classrooms in Northern Territory schools. The COAG Reform Council's recent report shows progress in being made in pre-school participation and early years literacy. The recent evaluation of the Northern Territory Emergency Response found that some 57% of people surveyed strongly agreed that the school in their community was better now than it was three years ago.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">This work must continue, but it is clear that for these improvements in schools to translate into improvements in educational outcomes for students, regular school attendance is essential. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">Improving attendance can never be done by governments and schools alone. For all the funding that governments invest and all the skills that teachers bring to their schools, we still ultimately rely on parents to get their children ready and to the school gate each morning. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">While the overwhelming majority of parents understand the value of education and are making sure their children are in class and learning for their future every day, there are a number who do not. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">The overwhelming opinion of Aboriginal people who participated in the Stronger Futures consultations in the Northern Territory was that they wanted action to hold to account those parents who do not send their children to school. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">The amendments in the Bill enable a new, integrated approach to managing cases of poor school attendance in the Northern Territory. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">According to this approach, if a child is not attending school regularly the school will convene an attendance conference with the family to talk through barriers to the child's education. The conference will agree on an attendance plan. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">The attendance plan will include actions that the family commit to undertake, for example, walking the child to school in the mornings or providing a place for the child to study at home. Support from a social worker will be available to help the family meet their obligations under the plan.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">Importantly, the attendance plan can also include actions that the school or other parties will undertake, for example, providing a school uniform or resolving an issue around bullying that may be contributing to the child's disengagement.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">This is a collaborative approach that attempts to improve attendance in partnership with the family.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">However, it is important that there be a lever to ensure families engage in this process. If a family refuses to participate in the attendance conference, or refuses to agree to an attendance plan, or fails to live up to their agreed actions in the attendance plan when other parties to the plan fulfil their commitments, then their income support payments may be suspended until they do. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">If the family complies within 13 weeks, their income support payment can be reinstated with full back pay. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">This is a sensible approach that apportions responsibility for school attendance appropriately between the school and family. </span>

                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">Young people who take up work will be rewarded more for their efforts. From 1 July 2012 job seekers receiving Youth Allowance will be able to earn more and still retain their payment. The income free level will be increased from $62 a fortnight to $143 a fortnight and the Working Credit limit will be increased three and a half fold from $1000 to $3500. This means that young job seekers will be able to earn more than twice as much before their income support payments are affected.  </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">To ensure that all young people under similar circumstances are in receipt of the same income support payment, changes will also be made to the age requirements for Sickness Allowance, the Youth Disability Supplement and the Longer Term Income Support rate for students.  </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">The Building Australiaâ€™s Future Workforce Package also includes important changes to income support payments for parents to provide greater incentives and opportunities for parents, particularly single parents, to re engage in the workforce and share in the benefits that work brings.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">With around 520,000 dependent children in jobless families at risk of the social and economic disadvantage that is associated with joblessness, this is more critical than ever.  </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">The Government is making a number of changes to Parenting Payment to encourage parents with school age children to re-enter the workforce sooner and to ensure greater consistency in the Parenting Payment eligibility rules.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">Since 1 July 2011, children born to or coming into the care of parents who have been receiving Parenting Payment since before July 2006 have not extended these parentâ€™s eligibility for payment. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">From 1 January 2013, these parents will cease to qualify for Parenting Payment when their youngest eligible child turns 12 or 13 in 2013, or 12 in subsequent years, rather than the current 16. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">Current recipients whose youngest eligible child was born before 1 January 2000 will be exempt from this change.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">We need to act now to ensure that these parents have the opportunity to benefit from our growing economy, to increase their self-sufficiency and achieve greater financial security, and to provide their families with good working role models.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">This is why the Government is reforming the income test that applies to single principal carer parents on Newstart Allowance.  </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">The introduction of a more generous income test will allow these parents to earn over $400 more per fortnight before they lose eligibility for payment. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">This will provide stronger incentives for parents to undertake paid work by allowing parents to retain more of their income support as their employment income rises.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">To ensure that individuals and families, particularly those affected by the Parenting Payment changes, are not disadvantaged when transitioning to new payment arrangements, the Government is streamlining the claim provisions that apply to Newstart Allowance. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">This change will enable claims for Newstart Allowance to be lodged up to 13 weeks prior to the day on which the person will become qualified, in line with the rules that apply to other income support payments. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">This will not change the date from which Newstart Allowance is paid; it will however provide a smoother claim process for those transferring to Newstart Allowance.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">In recognition that affected parents are likely to have spent significant periods on income support and out of the workforce, the Government is also providing additional support for these parents to ease their transition back into the workforce.  </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">This includes additional training places and community based support for single parents as well as access to professional career advice through Job Services Australia providers.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">The Government believes that together these changes provide parents with the right balance of support and incentives to make the most of the employment opportunities available, to find meaningful work and provide themselves and their families with a better future.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">An important element in the way that support is provided to job seekers is the job seeker participation requirements and compliance arrangements. These arrangements help job seekers move off income support and into paid employment by reinforcing education, vocational training, and work experience opportunities.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">To simplify the compliance framework and reinforce the requirement that job seekers move towards gaining a skill and getting a job, the different daily penalty amounts for short-term financial penalties will be aligned at one-tenth of a job seekerâ€™s participation payment. This will simplify the compliance framework and ensure job seekers are not penalised because a weekend happens to fall before they can re-engage.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">The Bill also makes a minor technical amendment to a cross reference in a rate calculator in the Social Security Act.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">Finally this Bill will amend the Indigenous Education Targeted Assistance Act 2000 to provide the appropriation to fund the 12 months extension of the Student Education Trusts measure as part of the extension of the Cape York Welfare Reform Trials announced by the Minister for Families, Community Services and Indigenous Affairs in 2011.  </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">The Student Education Trusts are a financial management service which supports and encourages parents and care-givers from the remote Indigenous communities of Aurukun, Coen, Hope Vale and Mossman Gorge on Cape York in Far North Queensland to save for their childrenâ€™s education costs from the early years through to tertiary education. The Trusts are an important part of the Closing the Gap strategy in Indigenous education in Far North Queensland. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">The changes in this Bill form an important part of the income support reforms included in the Governmentâ€™s Building Australiaâ€™s Future Workforce Package. These reforms will encourage more Australians to participate in and share in the benefits of paid work, equip them with the necessary skills to improve their future employment prospects and will result in  more consistent treatment of income support recipients and better support and assistance to parents and jobseekers.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Ordered that further consideration of the second reading of these bills be adjourned to the first sitting day of the next period of sittings, in accordance with standing order 111.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Small">The Additional Estimates Bills seek appropriation authority from Parliament for the additional expenditure of money from the Consolidated Revenue Fund. These funds are sought in order to meet requirements that have arisen since the last Budget as well as to take into account impacts on Australiaâ€™s economic and fiscal outlook that have arisen as a result of the European sovereign debt crisis and instability on the Global financial markets. The total additional appropriation being sought through Additional Estimates Bills 3 and 4 this year is a little over $3.1 billion.</span>

The Government remains on track to deliver a budget surplus in the 2012-13 financial year.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">So spoke the then Minister for Workplace Relations, Ms Gillard, in introducing legislation into this place to get rid of the Australian Building and Construction Commission.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">As a result of this legislation being put forward, the Senate had an inquiry into the bill. After the Senate had finished its inquiry and was busily writing its report, the Labor government in the House of Representatives, at one minute to midnight, introduced a Greens-inspired amendment to absolutely gut that which would have remained of the Australian Building and Construction Commission. And the issue that needs to be reviewed by the Senate committee is not only a workplace relations issue. This goes to the very issue and fundamentals of the rule of law in our country. Indeed, that which Ms Gillard promisedâ€”like she promised with the carbon taxâ€”has now been shown to be an empty promise. But this is even more serious than the carbon tax, because it undermines the very fundamentals of the rule of law. Allow me to explain. The amendment that the Greens inspired and the Labor Party passed in the other place means that a prosecuting authority can no longer pursue the prosecution if the parties have come to a settlement between themselves. Just imagine if the police were no longer allowed to charge somebody who drove through a red light, settled up with a person whose car they damagedâ€”and paid them a bit of extra moneyâ€”and as a result the police were denied prosecution of the case. Or imagine an arson case in which somebody does not want to go to jail, does not want to be prosecuted and goes to the person whose property he has burnt down and says, 'I'll pay for all the damages plus $100,000,' and the police are then denied prosecution of that person for arson.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">That is what the Labor Party and the Greens want to introduce into the industrial law of this country. What it means is that big unions and big businessâ€”with big walletsâ€”will be able to buy themselves out of prosecution but the individual worker will not be able to, because they will not have the money. The small subcontractor on our building sites will not have the money to do that. There will be institutionalised corruption and institutionalised pay-offs. What is more, this has been such a deceptive move. Indeed, when we as the coalition senators wanted the hearing to go on for a bit longer than we had been allowed we were told, 'All this has been canvassed for ages.' If it had been canvassed for so longâ€”for agesâ€”then why this last-minute amendment?</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Let us be quite clear. The government must have known it was going to move this amendment but deliberately hid it from the Senate and the public to ensure that this amendment, which is just so fundamental in undermining the rule of law in our country, was hidden from the inquiry so it could no longer be investigated. Or it was a genuine last-minute amendment. And if it was a genuine last-minute amendment then, given that it is of such consequence that three state Attorneys-General have come out to condemn it as undermining the whole basis on which the rule of law runs in this country, this is worthy of further examination by the Senate.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The Australian Greens, I have no doubt, will be voting against this matter going to a Senate committee, as will the Labor Party. If they do so it will be proof positive that they knew about this beforehand and that it was deliberately denied to the Australian people. Either way, this matter should be going to a Senate committee for further consideration.</span>

                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Tasmania</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">17:25</span>):  The government does not support this motion. In fact, the opposition knows that the Senate does not support the motion. Regardless of that, here they come again, the old relics of the Work Choices era, all lined up trying to stop one of the last bastions of fear from their terrible era in government from being abolished. They are so desperate to cling to this relic of the past, so desperate thatâ€”although a report on this bill is due to be provided to the Senate next in the scheduleâ€”they seek to send it off again to the same committee and for the same purpose, no doubt wasting the time of the industry in again making submissions and again appearing before the committee.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The government's position on the ABCC has been clear for a long period of time. Unlike the coalition with Work Choices, which was thrust upon an unsuspecting electorate, the Labor Party made a commitment to the Australian people prior to both the 2007 and the 2010 election that we would replace the ABCC with a new body, that we would provide a balanced framework for cooperative and productive workplace relations in the building and construction industry, that we would provide a body that is part of our fair work system. There can be no doubt that the government has a mandate to abolish the ABCC. We won the 2007 election and, much to the chagrin of those opposite, were able to negotiate confidence and supply from some of the Independents in 2010 because those Independents decided that the Labor Party was the best party to govern this country and progress reform for the betterment of hardworking Australians.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">You also know full well that we have consistently stated that anyone who breaks a law should feel the full force of the law. As a responsible government we will not tolerate an environment in which people choose which laws to obey and which ones to ignore. But we expect this to apply for all industrial participants, and we expect that an industrial regulator will use its resources fairly and not just single out workers and their democratically elected representatives. They waltz in here with their attempts to stifle the work of the Senate with procedural debates and with this motion, which is to come just before the release of the report by the Senate committee.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Those opposite cannot accept that they lost the argument in 2007. The people spoke. The people said they wanted a fair industrial relations system in this country. This bill, the Building and Construction <span style="&#xD;&#xA;    font-size:10pt;&#xD;&#xA;  ">Industry Improvement Amendment (Transition to Fair Work) Bill 2012,</span> moves well in that direction. This bill strikes a balance of fairness. It is sad for this country that those opposite are so committed to obscuring fairness in the workplace for everyday Australiansâ€”those workers who are building Australia. The construction industry is a dangerous and arduous industry to work in. It is characterised by a system of subcontracting, many small employers, widespread use of a labour hire workforce and intense competitive pressures. They can contribute to compromises on safety issues, breakdowns in the chain of responsibility and difficulties in maintaining effective employee representation on safety issues from job to job. Injury and fatality rates remain unacceptably high.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">But it is a fact that there is a positive link between trade union involvement at workplaces and improved OH&amp;S outcomes. Workers are best placed to know what issues make their workplace unsafe and workers should have the right and the power to seek changes to bad practice before accidents occur. If workers feel intimidated about raising issues of safety concern, everyone working at a site is at a higher risk of an accident.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The ABCC has its origins in the recommendations of the Cole royal commission into the building and construction industry. This was set up by those opposite in a desperate attempt to attack unions in the lead-up to the 2001 federal election campaign. The royal commission was an intensely politicised process from the outset. The focus was almost exclusively on union conduct. No serious attempt was made to balance the inquiry with an examination of employer conduct. Interestingly, despite its enormous cost to the public, of the 392 instances of so-called unlawful conduct in the final report only one was ever pursued and it was ultimately dropped without being prosecuted to finality.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The government understands that the industry contains unique challenges for both employers and employees and as a result we have always supported a strong building industry regulator to ensure lawful conduct by all participants and a strong set of compliance arrangements for the building industry. This bill honours those commitments but, as the coalition fails to understand, it strives to strike a balance.</span>

It has been said that we wanted a range of people to appear before that committee and, of course, we were denied access to it. We went through this whole process in the best of good faith. To see now that this has appeared minutes before midnight and to see that it has been made public in a media release from a House of Representatives member, being a Greens member, is a travesty and something that this chamber should not accept.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">What this amendment does is go right to the core of those comments that Ms Gillard made. It emphasises again her absolute emptiness when it comes to any attempt with regard to justice and honesty and fairness in this process.</span>

                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Yesterday I asked the minister with responsibility, Senator Arbib, if he could respond and, of course, in his final days in this place he has lost interest so therefore he was not only not across the issue but was not able to answer my question. But he made one allegation to me, and that is that my interests are with workers and small businesses and contractors. If he wants to apply that to me, I will accept that with pride, because what this committee tried to do was to absolutely protect the interests of workers, small businesses and contractorsâ€”and this amendment goes completely to the heart of those three particular groups. All Senator Arbib could do was bleat about a tough cop on the beat. If indeed the government knew that this amendment was coming on why was it not presented for the committee to debate? I am bitterly disappointed that my Senate colleague and chairman of this committee did not see fit to come into this place and to actually defend it. Why? Because I believe he would be as embarrassed as I, as the deputy chairman, am angry to have been dealt with in such a tawdry fashion.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">So what are we going to have now if this is not going to be the subject of a reference back to our committee? What we are clearly going to have is pay-off money. We are going to see pay-off money at every level and it may well apply on the union side and it may well apply on the employer side. It does not matter what side it applies on. The fact of the matter is that this amendment, if passed, will remove the right of the police and other law enforcement agents to actually prosecute the case. We could think of many instancesâ€”as Senator Abetz has said, in a road accident or in a drug related situationâ€”in which somebody is apprehended, they go to the other side, they put pressure on them and they may or may not offer them money in return for the case being dropped. Well, isn't that wonderful, given the level to which we have descended in this country where you can have a bit of a backroom deal between two parties, whether it is fair or whether it is not fair, and this Senate of the Australian parliament is actually going to endorse this! The Senate is going to improve it! The Senate is going to deny the police and other parties the right to actually investigate aberrant and illegal behaviour be it of employers, unions, contractors or whomever. And who are the losers in this? The ones that I spoke to Senator Arbib about yesterday. It will be workers on sites, it will be employees, it will be small contractors. They are the ones who will be the losers and they will look to this chamber and say, 'A pox on you for your failure to protect us.' This must go back to a reference to the committee. <span style="font-style:italic;">(Time expired)</span></span>

                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">New South Wales</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">17:35</span>):  I must say that I find the opposition's hysteria on this particular issue somewhat amusing indeed, because if we did accept this motion from Senate Abetz we would find ourselves having this matter referred to a Senate inquiry not for the first time, not for the second time, not for the third time and not for the fourth time but for the fifth time. It would be the fifth time that the Senate would have looked at this particular issue. It was first looked at in 2003, then in 2005, in 2008 and in 2009 and we have done an inquiry that has just been completed and is the subject of a report before the Senateâ€”and now Senator Abetz is asking for another inquiry into these provisions. I am all for scrutiny in this place, but this is beyond the pale. This is gilding the lily. This is an unbelievable waste of the Senate's resources, particularly in the context where in 2007 the Australian public made it very clear indeed that they had had enough of the Howard government's regime of workplace relations. They thoroughly rejected the Work Choices regime, the forcing of people to bargain as individuals, which cut rates, cut penalty entitlements and cut other entitlements, particularly for younger workers. They had had enough of the coercive powers of the building and construction industry commissioner. They said quite clearly at that election that change was required, and of course in the wake of that election the government acted on the Forward with Fairness election policies that we had taken to the 2007 election. The suite of reforms that are finally being introduced through the legislation and through the subject of this report deliver on that commitment that we made to the Australian public.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">But we have also ensured that a process was undertaken in the building and construction industry to ensure that there would not be unintended consequences of the reforms. In that respect, the Hon. Murray Wilcox, QC, a former Federal Court judge, was instructed to conduct an inquiry into the transition to Fair Work Australia for the building and construction industry. He made a number of recommendations which are enshrined in the Building and Construction Industry Improvement Amendment (Transition to Fair Work) Bill 2012, which will see established the Fair Work (Building Industry) Act. We have gone through the process three or four times. We have been through the arguments when it comes to reform in this area. We have been through the arguments in respect of the coercive powers and of differential penalties, and we have found, based on the recommendations, that we are implementing a fair and balanced system. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">There is no greater example of that than in the recommendations that were made and the provisions that are being enacted with regard to coercive powers. This legislation will still include the capacity for the director of the building inspectorate to obtain an examination notice authorising the use of powers to compulsorily obtain information or documents from a person who the director believes is relevant to an investigation. However, there will be a strong set of safeguards which will enshrine the principles of fairness and natural justice, and those powers will not be able to be used unless a number of safeguards have been satisfied, including a presidential member of the AAT being satisfied that the case has been made for their fair use.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">In respect of the points made by Senator Abetz, the amendment will ensure that the building industry participants are not subject to multiple proceedings, that matters that have been the subject of litigation and are settled will not be reinvestigated and will not be the subject of further litigation. That is in accordance with accepted civil law principles. <span style="font-style:italic;">(Time expired)</span></span>

                      <span class="HPS-MemberContinuation">Senator FISHER:</span>
                    </a>  Exactly! He just said it again: 'back to it'. Back to the past. This government with this amendment to the legislation is trying to take the entire country to a place that we have never been before. This government with this amendment, which was, as Senator Abetz said, snuck inâ€”a dirty deal between the government and the Greens to buy the Greens' support for the bill in the Senateâ€”five minutes before midnight, takes the entire country and the laws of this country to a place they have never been before, and it is a whole new low. As Senator Abetz said, this goes way beyond workplace relations. It even takes workplace relations itself to a whole new realm and of course, just as the CFMEU wants, it takes the building and construction industry to a whole new realm which did not even exist in the circumstances that led to the creation of the Cole royal commission into the building and construction industry. How so?</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">As to how this takes the country to a whole new place beyond workplace relations, the Australian Securities and Investments Commission retains discretion to prosecute, even in the event that the alleged victims of breach of the law might have reached agreement with the alleged perpetrator. ASIC still retains discretion to prosecute. No matter what the alleged offence, no matter what an alleged victim or an alleged offender might say about cease and desist or whatever else, the police properly retain a discretion to proceed. Nowhere in this country is there legislation that says that if there is some sort of settlement the authoritiesâ€”be it ASIC, be it the policeâ€”are legislatively prevented from proceeding. But the government wants to have it in the building and construction industry. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">What then of the victim of repeated domestic violence? Look only at the history of that terrible type of crime, where victims often say, 'No action, thank you.' Is the government saying that police should not have the discretion to prosecute nonetheless in that scenario? What about in workplace relations itself, where the Fair Work Ombudsman has the discretion to prosecute, for example, an employer who underpays workers? Is Senator Cameron really saying that if the employer underpays workers the Fair Work Ombudsman should be legislatively prevented from prosecuting the employer for breaching the law? I would like to hear him say so. Is the government really doing with this legislation what it tries to say it is doing in its attempt at justification for the bill? </span>

                    <span style="&#xD;&#xA;    font-family:;&#xD;&#xA;  color:gray;" />The report says, 'The committee remains opposed to industry-specific legislation as a matter of broad principle. The goal should be coverage of all workers in the building and construction sector by the provisions of the Fair Work Act.' <span style="&#xD;&#xA;    font-family:;&#xD;&#xA;  color:gray;">Are you going to make the provisions of the Fair Work Act in this respect apply to all workers? Do not be silly.

When Justice Spender was commenting on the Steven Lovewell and Bradley O'Carroll case, he said: </span>

                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">The case, as brought and as evidenced by the evidence yesterday, was misconceived, was completely without merit and should not have been brought. There is room for the view that if the commissionâ€”</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">that was the ABCCâ€”</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">was even-handed in discharging its task of ensuring industrial harmony and lawfulness in the building or construction industry proceedings, not necessarily in this court and not necessarily confined to civil industrial law, should have been brought against a company, Underground, and its managing director and possibly another director. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I have not got the time to go into all the details but there is case after case after case where senior judges of this country say that the ABCC have acted in a biased manner against union officials and against workersâ€”case after case. It is an absolute disgrace. It is an absolute tragedy for democracy and a fair go in this country. What will it mean for workers if Senator Abetz, the work choice warrior, Senator Back, who does the bidding of the Western Australian mining companies, and Senator Fisher, who has made her career off the back of trying to destroy workers' rights, were in charge of industrial relations in this country? It will mean that their penalty rates will go. Their rights will go. They will be subjected to some of the worst law that will be seen not only in this country but in any comparable country overseas. No modern country has legislation like theirs. It is Tory legislation. It is conservative legislation. It is bad legislation. And we will not have a bar of it. <span style="font-style:italic;">(Time expired)</span></span>

That is what the legislation allows for. One of the concerns I brought forward in the committee was that in some casesâ€”for example in aviation trainingâ€”the capital costs can be quite significant. One of the concerns expressed to the committee was that there may not have been sufficient time for some providers to restructure their debt arrangements prior to the commencement of this scheme. I was wondering if the governÂ­ment has paid heed to that, Minister.</span>

That is helpful, but the problem is this: the capital outlays in some particular courses are much greater than in others. I am receiving feedback all the time from higher education providersâ€”and, indeed, it was among the evidence received at the hearings of both the Senate and the House of Representatives committeesâ€”that with this change in the fee structure the cashflow crisis that could occur in cases of great capital outlays has not been fully addressed. You say, Minister, it has been addressed, but I cannot answer that. Let me tell you, Sir, that there is still great concern within the sector about this. I thought you should know that.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">These amendments essentially deal with the issue of natural justice. When these international students are in our country, they will clearly get into trouble at timesâ€”there will be misbehaviour, defaults on their commitmentsâ€”and at the moment the way the system plays out results in students falling foul of the expectations and rules they are supposed to abide by. They end up being treated as second-class citizens. The amendments before us seek to deal with this situation. At the moment a student who is refused provision of their course because they have misbehaved is considered as defaulting and thus is not necessarily eligible for a refund of their prepaid tuition fees. Given that the bill is about ensuring the rights of overseas students are sensibly protected, we are seeking to raise the standards and ensure that international students are given a fair deal and are given a first-class education, that their rights are protected and that, if things go wrong, they are not going to lose out financially. Our amendment will insert: 'provider accords the student natural justice before refusing to provide, or continue providing, the course to the student' on the grounds of misbehaving. This allows due process because it allows students to appeal such a charge and it provides some surety that the student will not suffer disadvantage while waiting for the resolution of an appeal. It really is quite a simple mechanism. I think it is what any of us would expect to occur if we were in a similar situation in Australia or elsewhere. For students who default or where there is some form of misbehaviour they are allowed a fair form of justice so that they are not disadvantaged in the way that they are currently disadvantaged, with very few rights as it plays out. It could damage not only their immediate education but also their view of how these courses play out in Australia. I would be interested in the minister's response because it seems a necessary measure that is in keeping with the overall intent of the bill.</span>

The government says that your proposed amendments are redundant because of existing protections that are found in the National Code of Practice for Registration Authorities and Providers of Education and Training to Overseas Students 2007â€”'the code', as it is generally referred to in this space. The code is enforceable under the ESOS Act. The government also notes that late last year the government established the Overseas Students Ombudsman to provide strong complaints handling for students. Notwithstanding those important facts, the government is happy to agree to the amendments proposed. I guess that is the happy end of it, Chair.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">They are similar to amendments I have previously moved which Senator Hanson-Young, from the Australian Greens, supported in substance. They are very similar amendments in terms of the general principle of ministerial discretion. This sends a signal to overseas students that, in the event that something goes wrong, the minister has the discretion to say, 'Your losses go beyond tuition fees.' If there are accommodation expenses and the like, the minister has the discretion to set what that amount could be. It could be capped, but in this caseâ€”and this is where it differs from previous amendments I have moved, which were supported by the Australian Greens, and I am grateful for their supportâ€”I have bent over backwards to ensure that there is a link back to the financial viability of the fund so that this would be seen to be consistent and responsible regarding the fund and the financial constraints of the fund. All it does is give the minister the discretion to say that additional compensation or additional matters can be considered. The minister does not have to use that discretion. If the minister chooses to use his or her discretion, the minister can determine to cap the amounts of compensation payable.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I note that Minister Evans, in his summing-up to the second reading contributions, said that he was not inclined to support these amendments. I have tried to engage constructively and positively with the minister's office because I, the government, the opposition, the Australian Greens and the DLP in this chamber all believe very much in the overseas students sector. It is an important part of Australia's economy and it is an important part of our education system. There does not seem to be any logical reason to reject an amendment that simply gives the minister the discretionary power. The minister does not have to exercise it; it just gives the minister the power to provide additional compensation if the minister sees fit. In the absence of the government providing support for this, what undertaking is the government inclined to give to ensure that this live issue of an adequate level of compensation is dealt with? You may have an overseas studentâ€”and I have heard these storiesâ€”who, when their college collapses, can get their tuition and enrolment fees back but has just forked out for rent, incidental expenses, airfares and a whole range of expenses that they are lumbered with as a result of the collapse. Getting back just the tuition fees is still going to cause significant hardship for these families. Some of these families, from the Subcontinent, for instance, make great sacrifices for their children to come to this country. I think that simply giving the minister that level of discretion would strengthen the intent of the bill in a substantial way.</span>

As always, it is a pleasure dealing with you. Indeed, perhaps on a more serious note, I do honour the sentiments and the motivations that have encouraged you to bring these amendments, but, alas, as indeed you appear to understand, the government does not accept this amendment.</span>

                    </a>  I will do my best to carry you through the government's reasoning. The government has implemented the Baird recommendation on this issue to allow regulators to impose any condition on a provider based on risk, including stopping them from collecting accommodation fees from the student. In addition, this issue has not been raised in submissions to the two inquiries that were conducted into this bill. Thirdly, the travel cost issues, we would submit, are easily managed through normal commercial travel insurance and do not require Australian government provisions. Fourthly, this proposed amendment would have financial implications for the TPS and for providers through the TPS levy. Fifthly, the reforms that the government is pursuing have at their heart the objective to deliver sustainable tuition protection. Your proposal, we would submit, seeks to expand the liability and it is worth noting, I think, that in the last two years the taxpayers of Australia have had to support the ESOS fund by injecting some $30 million into it. Lastly, the government believes this amendment is not straightforward and does not place any obligation on providers to refund a student's accommodation and travel expenses but instead expects the TPS to pick up that cost.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I might add further that the government have done, we would submit, a great deal in order to protect overseas students from unscrupulous providers. This is the third piece of legislation in two years to strengthen regulations under the ESOS. The governÂ­ment undertook systemic reregistration of all providers in 2010â€”I am sure you will remember thatâ€”which led to the removal of some 180 providers from the sector, and the government  established two new national regulators for higher education and VET. They are taking over full responsibility for regulation under ESOS from 1 July 2012.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">In summary, Senator Xenophon, while the government has resolved to not support your amendment, it certainly maintains that the concerns you have are not only fair, legitimate and, as I say, genuinely held but something that the government believes it has ably dealt with.</span>

                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">South Australia</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">18:19</span>):  Let us demolish some of these arguments once and for all. You do not need a bobcat or a big demolition thing; just one of those toy demolition trucks you can buy from Toys R Us for $29.95 would do. Let us deal with some of these arguments. Firstly, you say that these issues were not raised in the inquiry. I think it is implicit that, if there is a loss, the inquiry did deal with the issue of losses. If there are incidental losses, I would have thought that would have been within the remit of the Baird inquiry. I think Bruce Baird did a terrific job in dealing with a whole range of issues, but this is something that still is left untouched. I take your point about travel insurance, but if they do not have travel insurance it is still an incidental cost.</span>

                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">In terms of the financial implications for the TPS levy, that argument verges on the Orwellianâ€”it is not quite Orwellian, but it verges on the Orwellianâ€”for this reason: the amendment actually specifies that there cannot be any payment made if it would jeopardise the fund and that there must be consultation with the TPS director. In terms of a sustainable tuition fund, it actually acknowledges that. It says you cannot make any determination unless you consider those factors.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">You mention that $30 million of taxpayers' money has been spent on the ESOS fund. That is a lot of taxpayers' money, but also very significant is the risk if we continue to have a slide in the number of overseas students in this country. It is a multibillion dollar industry. I do not know whether Senator Mason off the top of his head can provide me with some gratuitous assistance, but I think it is about $15 billion a year.</span>

                    </a>  Thank youâ€”I should have asked Senator Rhiannon. It is a significant industry in my home state. If it means that we pay out another $10 million or $15 million a year, it is a very small insurance premium to pay to give certainty and confidence to overseas students, so students the world over will know that the responsible minister has the power, at his or her absolute discretion, to allow for additional compensation payments. Why is the government afraid of giving the minister a discretion that the minister can choose to use or not use? I do not understand why the government is so frightened of this amendment.

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I just do not get why the government will not give this level of certainty to overseas students by saying, 'If worst comes to worst, the minister has the discretion to make additional payments.' I would be very grateful if the parliamentary secretary, Senator Feeney, can respond to that, and I am looking forward to Senator Mason's contribution. If, by chance, he disappoints me with the position he takes, I would like to find out why he does not want to give overseas students that level of protection.</span>

On the one hand the government says that the amendment is not accepted by us, at least at this juncture, because of the issues I outlined earlier; but, above and beyond that, the minister is willing to undertake a review so that the issues exercising your concern will at least be able to be addressed. And I hope and trust you will all be thrilled with the demonstrable process and success of the bill.</span>

I concede that it is a matter of balance and it is not clear-cut. I think even the minister would concede that. It is about the price of insurance and the regulatory burden on the one hand versus the convenience or the confidence of students on the other. Senator Xenophon, you are right to suggest that the last time we debated this group of bills on ESOS the opposition voted against a similar amendment. We did, not because we do not believe that, as the minister said, it is well intentioned; we do think it is well intentioned. These are often close calls. But on this occasion the opposition does agree with the government that it is a bridge too far for the providers and the Tuition Protection Service.</span>

Firstly, is Senator Mason, as the shadow minister responsible for this, saying that simply giving the minister the discretion, circumscribed by protections to ensure consultation with the fund and affordability of the fund, to deal with matters is a bridge too far? Is he honestly saying that? Secondly, does he concedeâ€”and this is a question for the government as wellâ€”that unless this amendment is passed there will be no mechanism to compensate students, in the event of a failure of an educational institution, for ancillary expenses or losses such as for accommodation? If there is a direct mechanism to cover other consequential losses, please outline that. There may be certain circumstances, but, as I understand it, there will be a whole range of loopholes where students will not have the ability to be compensated for the failure of an institution because at the moment that is constrained within the terms of the legislation. This discretion would allow for a safety valve for students that have been hard done by, that have been let down by an unscrupulous operator, to actually seek some redress.</span>

The point I am making, and I suspect the government would agree, is that it is not a one-way street; it is a very tough balance. Thus far, the opposition has been persuaded that it is appropriate that the current amendments as recommended by Mr Baird are enough. If the minister says he is going to review the situation at some stage, I am interested in that. But, thus far, the opposition is not persuaded that the balance should move any further.</span>

Senator Xenophon, I would finish on this note. It is about striking the correct balance and it would seem to me that at some point here the government has to be firm about the fact that is not going to be the insurer of last resort for the sorts of failings that you are describing. Obviously the government is committed to establishing a regulatory framework that protects all the participants where possible and practicable, but at some point the balance has to be struck so that taxpayers are not continually exposed for what I might describe as market failure.</span>

I do not have anything against Eric Blair, or George Orwell. I understand the parliamentary secretary's instructions are very limited, but there will be some review of undefined terms and with an undefined time frame. Will it be in the next 12 months? If it cannot be in the next 12 months then I cannot see that the government is serious about it, because it will then push it to a new parliament. I would have thought that a six- or 12-month time frame would at least be a useful exercise. Would it be undertaken by Mr Baird? Would it be undertaken by the department or some other mechanism? Or would the government be open to a Senate standing committee looking at this as a discrete issue? I do not know why you laughed then, Parliamentary Secretary, but I am interested in finding out why.</span>

                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">New South Wales</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">18:31</span>):  The Greens will support Senator Xenophon's amendments. We have amendments that also cover this issue. We actually think that it needs to go further than Senator Xenophon has set out, but we will certainly still support this. In doing that, Senator Xenophon and I have had a bit of a chat about this, which he has outlined, because what he is putting forward is quite minimal. The senator has set this out, but I think it is worth unpicking this a little bit further because it is extraordinary that this amendment is not being supported.</span>

                    </a>  Yes, that is the emphasis here: that the minister could do nothing. It is the sort of thing that is amazing that the government did not come up with itself, so it would appear that it was doing something and then probably nothing would happen at all. I think we need to remember that what this ESOS bill is all about is seeking to strengthen protection of international students' interests. That is what many of us have spoken about here and that is what we are trying to achieve.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This issue does need to be addressed, because the damage that is being done to the education sector with regard to international students deciding if they will come to Australia is not just with regard to tuition fees. Many of them have been ripped off in other ways, and accommodation is a big one. I come from Sydney. I know how expensive accommodation in our city is, and this is so in many other areas. It can be a real burden on students and they often lose out. So here we have a minor regulatory mechanism that could be used if the minister so chose.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The fact that the government and the opposition are saying that they will not support it really does need to be emphasised because, while we have heard from the government and the opposition about the need for balance here, we are not seeing them striking a correct balance. What we are seeing is the balance being pushed to the providers and away from the students. The students are being left high and dry here. You can predict now that some international students are going to lose out when they are up for costs; they have put money forward and the services are not there. Accommodation is one of those areas where we know this will happen.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The failure of the government here again shows that while we have got a regulatory mechanism, which is essentially what this bill is all about, it is very minimal and in too many areas the providers are favoured over the students. I think the response we are hearing from the government and the opposition on this is actually very informative.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This takes up the issue of representation on the board. This does need to be tightened up. The current wording is quite loose, and it leaves it so open that it really ends up not being clear who would end up on the board. The Overseas Students Tuition Fund will pay for placement services and the cost of TPS staff and its director and the board, which is intended to represent the different sectors of international education providers. What we are dealing with here is who will be represented on that board. I understand that the sector has expressed concerns that there is no requirement in the Education Services for Overseas Students Legislation Amendment (Tuition Protection Service and Other Measures) Bill 2011 before us to ensure that representation, so that is what our amendment addresses. We are inserting an amendment requiring that the seven non-department board members represent providers from across the international education and training sector, including providers of ELICOS courses, which provide major pathways into further Australian studies for overseas students. Picking up English language courses is clearly needed here, but it is not just about that; it is about making it clearer about representation on this board in terms of the non-department participants. So I recommend the Greens amendment to my fellow senators because it is an area that needs to be tightened up, because the loose wording at the moment is a concern.</span>

                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Western Australia</span>â€”<span class="HPS-MinisterialTitles">Minister for Tertiary Education, Skills, Science and Research and Leader of the Government in the Senate</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">18:46</span>):   I thank Senator Rhiannon for her contribution. I do not think there is any disagreement here about the board needing to be representative. We have not actually specified in the bill the cohorts that would be represented, and this amendment, Greens amendment (4), seeks to add one particular groupâ€”that is, the ELICOS groupâ€”without actually considering the others.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We have not gone for something that is prescriptiveâ€”that says that there must be one representative of this and one representative of that. So I cannot support the amendment in its current form, in the sense that it just specifies one group and other groups will say, 'Well, why aren't we specified in the bill?' What I would suggest is that either I am going to have to oppose it and say that this is naturally what we will do, that my intention would be to have a cross-sector representative group, or, having looked at the amendment, I would be happy to support the amendment if the senator was prepared to move it with a full stop at the end of 'sector' and not put 'including providers of English language intensive courses for overseas students'â€”on the understanding that they, of course, would be one of the groups represented. But under this amendment only one of them is named and the others are not named. So the intent I agree withâ€”that it be broadly representativeâ€”and, if the senator is prepared to drop that last bit out of the amendment, I will accept the amendment. That would give her a broad policy intent, which is to have recognised that we need a broader group with a range of experiences. But I do not think we should just name one group that ought to be representative without thinking about the overall balance.</span>

Thank you, Minister, for making that suggestion as a way forward. You spoke about the different cohorts, and I thought that it might be useful to get on the record a clarification. I understand that you did specify the need for providers of English language intensive courses to be one of those cohorts. If you could share with us, so it is on the record, what those cohorts are that should be represented, I think it would be useful.</span>

The reason I objected to the last part of your original amendment is that we have not done that consideration and I was not able to be clear yet which groups ought to be representedâ€”so I did not want to do that on that run. Clearly, your amendment, which will now become part of the bill and hopefully the act, provides for people having 'qualifications or experience relevant to the operations of providers from across the international education and training sector'. So it will be representative of the various sections across thatâ€”obviously, university, VET, private and publicâ€”but I do not want to try on the run to define those things.</span>

But, clearly, by the insertion of this clause it has to be representative of the breadth of the sector, and I am quite happy to indicate that ELICOS is an important part of the sector and it will need to be part of that representative group.</span>

                    <span style="text-decoration:none underline;">. What we are dealing with here is protection of overseas students to ensure their unexpended tuition fees are available for refund should their education provider default on course provision. </span>

                    <span style="text-decoration:none underline;">e are arguing that the protection does need to go further, because there is nothing in these bills to protect students when they pay other upfront substantial fees, such as accommodation fees to pro</span>
                    <span style="text-decoration:none underline;">vidersâ€”and that does happen. The</span>

                    <span style="text-decoration:none underline;"> can disappear if there is a shonky provider. There have been examples of thatâ€”and, sadly, we know there will be further examples. A key issue here is that there needs to be some measure of protection in this legislation.</span>

                    <span style="text-decoration:none underline;"> to afford prepaid accommodation fees the same protection as tuition fees. That is the question that the minister does need to answer here.

                    <span style="text-decoration:none underline;">,</span>
                    <span style="text-decoration:none underline;"> and may do so before a course commences, that protection does need to be in place.</span>

                    <span style="text-decoration:none underline;">I would put to senators that </span>
                    <span style="text-decoration:none underline;">these amendments recognise</span>
                    <span style="text-decoration:none underline;"> the reality of paying upfront accommodation bonds and rent while ensuring the money is used only for </span>
                    <span style="text-decoration:none underline;">accommodation, which is what the student has paid for. Again, the essence of this is about protecting the upfront money students have paidâ€”in this case, in the main for accommodation.</span>
                    <span style="text-decoration:none underline;"> I</span>
                    <span style="text-decoration:none underline;">f we are willing to put protection in place for tuition fees, why do we not give greater certainty and confidence to students who come here? As Senator Xenophon said, so many families </span>
                    <span style="text-decoration:none underline;">make</span>
                    <span style="text-decoration:none underline;"> enormous sacrifice</span>

                    </span>
                    <span style="text-decoration:none underline;">Surely we need to be rebuilding the reputation of our education services. At the moment, this legislation goes </span>

                    <span style="text-decoration:none underline;">part of the way to achieving that. If this protection is not put in place, it again suggests that the providers are having too much say </span>
                    <span style="text-decoration:none underline;">in</span>
                    <span style="text-decoration:none underline;"> how this government brings forward legislation.</span>

From previous comments made by Senator Feeney before Senator Evans arrived, it was set out that the issue of accommodation costs would not be picked up in the </span>

                    <span style="text-decoration:none underline;"> (Western Australiaâ€”Minister for Tertiary Education, Skills, Science and Research and Leader of the Government in the Senate) (18:55):Â  I think the first thing to say, Senator Rhiannon, is that this is a policy response to the concerns about protection of tuition fees. That is the first answer. The second answer is: as I understand it, the issues you raise have not been raised in the debate around the </span>
                    <span style="text-decoration:none underline;">bills</span>
                    <span style="text-decoration:none underline;">
                    </span>
                    <span style="text-decoration:none underline;">in the committee inquiry,</span>
                    <span style="text-decoration:none underline;">
                    </span>
                    <span style="text-decoration:none underline;">s</span>
                    <span style="text-decoration:none underline;">o I have been quite surprised by Senator Xenophon</span>
                    <span style="text-decoration:none underline;">'s</span>
                    <span style="text-decoration:none underline;"> and your focus on this.</span>
                    <span style="text-decoration:none underline;"> These are not issues that have been raised with me in recent times. It is of course factually the case that while there are some people who accept </span>
                    <span style="text-decoration:none underline;">accommodation packages as part of the student's tuition and enrolment processes, the majority do not. This is not an issue that has been at the forefront of anyone's attention in recent times. We did, I understand, have one bad case where a provider with those sorts of arrangements in place did become insolvent.</span>
                  </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This is not an issue that has been consulted on. We have had a consultative process with people and we have had the committee inquiry. We would now be saying, 'By the way, we are going to add in this major change to the legislation.' Normally people say to me, 'You have not consulted enough,' but if the parliament is going to say, 'Throw this in the mix as well' and 'By the way, it is also going to pick up those issues,' I think that is not a good way to do business. Secondly, the financial implications of this have not been costed. I do not know what this would cost the Commonwealth. I think this is not the appropriate response to a problem which you say exists but which has not been generally talked about nor generated concern.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I am obviously concerned that we get the best system we can in place. This is the last of a whole set of reforms responding to the Baird review and the terrible situation that developed in the international student area a couple of years ago. As you know, as immigration minister at the time I took a keen interest in these issues, because I think a lot of bad practice had developed with a small number of providers. We have done our best to clean it up both from the immigration end and the education end. I think things are vastly improved, but we have got to constantly be vigilant about these issues; because, as I said earlier, this is about 'brand Australia'. Every time there is a bad student experience it impacts on all providers and on Australia's international reputation. So as well as the impact on the student there is the impact on the international education sector.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">One of the things we have done is to set up the Chaney committee, which is reviewing the international education sector to make sure we have got a more holistic view of how that sector is managed, of government's engagement with the sector and where we see that sector going in the longer term. It is a very large industry; it is a huge export earner for Australia, and we have never thought about it in those terms. I think that the rapid growth without any structure around the actual industry led to some of the problems we have seen. Hopefully the Chaney report will give us that context. I understand that Senator Feeney, on my behalf, gave an assurance about reviewing the impact of the issues around accommodation that you raise. I am happy to do that. If there is a genuine problem, we will address it. I indicated that I am happy to address any issue that is there, but this is not something that has been raised with me. It is not something that was raised beyond the Baird process or in the committee inquiry. So I am not inclined to say, on the run, that we ought to do this without consulting anybodyâ€”without clear evidence of a problem or what you suggest is the solution. I am happy to take the issue seriously and to see what we can do to analyse if there is a problem, what is the problem, and what might be a policy response. We will put the assurances we gave in place, and obviously I will find a mechanism for reporting back to the Senate about how that is going. If there is a problem, I am happy to address it.</span>

Whilst it is quite a different approach to the approach in my amendment it still covers the same principle, in a sense; that is, what do you do in circumstances that go beyond where there is a loss of accommodation expenses, particularly prepaid expenses? I understand the government's position, and that was also traversed in my amendment with Senator Feeney, but my question to the minister is, is there any scope at the moment in this bill to cover a loss that a student may sustain as a result of prepaid accommodation expenses? In other words, is there any capacity for that student, who has paid accommodation upfront in addition to tuition fees, to receive some form of recompense or compensation?</span>

It is not designed to pick up accommodation, air fares, medical expenses or any of the range of other expenses a student might incur in coming to Australia. It is designed as a tuition payments protection scheme. It does not pick those other matters up.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">It is the case, though, that we have the capacity to make some decisions about a particular provider based on risk. That potential is there. One could conceivably make a decision that a particular provider or set of providers should not be accepting payment for accommodation because they are seen as being of risk, but I am not sure how successful or appropriate that would be. I am not suggesting it as a policy response, just that there is some capacity there. But no, the bill is not designed to pick up this question of accommodation.</span>

I am happy to go out there and see how big the problem is. I have no idea, for instance, how many providers actually provide accommodation packages as part of that provision. I have no idea how many people have been affected in the past. It raises the question of what happens if someone then transfers to another provider. There is a whole lot about this proposition that you and the Greens are advancing that, quite frankly, I do not think we know enough about. I am unwilling to accept amendments when no-one has raised it with me and no-one has provided any evidence in recent times about this issue. I just do not think we have the factual understanding to move to implementing legislation regarding the issues being raised. As I have given an undertaking to do the review, if Senator Xenophon, Senator Rhiannon or anyone else has issues, examples or experiences they want to bring to our attention I would be happy to receive them, because that would give us some context.</span>

When part of this tranche of bills was dealt with a year or two ago there was an amendment about the minister's discretion to deal with issues, which Senator Hanson-Young co-sponsored with me. It is not as though it has come entirely out of the blue, but I understand what the minister has said, and I agree with him about the Baird review process.</span>

It is an issue that was raised with us, and we are seeking to address it. It provides that up to 50 per cent of total course fees, or 100 per cent for a course of 24 weeks or less, can be paid upfront at any time before the course commences. Once a student has begun a course, the provider cannot require the student to pay any further tuition fees more than two weeks prior to the second study period. If a student chooses to pay earlier, there is no requirement for the provider to return the tuition fees to the student and they would not be found non-compliant. This will protect the interests of students and reduce refunds flowing to the TPS without imposing unworkable requirements on providers.</span>

There was concern raised about how clear this was in the legislation. This is designed to give that clarity and to reassure people of what their obligations are. So it is just a response to feedback we have had from people with an interest. There is no change to the rules, as it were; it is just to make it clear.</span>

                    </a>  These amendments deal with a failure in the legislation to bring new providers into the TPS levy. What we have right now is a system where new providers are effectively exempt, and that really is a major anomaly for legislation that is supposedly bringing in a tighter regulatory framework for how this industry operates. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I put it to my fellow senators that these amendments are essential. New providers really are at greater risk of defaulting, leaving students high and dry. How this works is that the administrative fees we are dealing with here are set at $100 plus $2 per enrolment for the previous year. The base fees are set at $200 plus $5 per enrolment for the previous year. But when it comes to new providers, clearly there is not a previous year. So what is happening is that they are being left out. How the system works is that new providers seeking registration are in effect exempt from the $2 and $5 per student components because they do not have a prior history of enrolments. You would have to say this is an absurd contradiction in risk assessment terms. Again, I would be interested to hear from the minister. How did they miss this out? Surely it can be easily solvedâ€”and that is what our amendments attempt to do.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">As I understand it, new providers must already provide projected domestic and overseas student numbers with their application for CRICOS registration. So our amendment to this bill would ensure that new providers are also charged per student using their projected likely total enrolments to complete the calculation. So it really can be sorted out quite easily. It is a serious anomaly; it leaves out new providers. We all know that, when businesses first get going, it is more likely that they will default, that they will in some way fold. We also know that these new providers have to put forward their likely total enrolments. So let us use that to bring them into the current system with regard to the setting of administration fees. I look forward to the minister's comments about this, because surely it is an anomaly that needs to be fixed up.</span>

I think I understand what Senator Rhiannon is trying to do, but we are not able to support it.

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Tasmania</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">19:21</span>):  I rise this evening on adjournment to speak about some of the fantastic activities happening in the electorate of Denison supported by the Gillard Labor government. King George V Ovalâ€”or KGV as it is fondly known by Tasmaniansâ€”is home to local AFL team, the Glenorchy Magpies. The Magpies receive a huge amount of support from the local community, with thousands of people braving all kinds of weather to support their team. This is a place that is the hub for the sporting community in Glenorchy. Thanks to the Gillard Labor government, change is afoot and a redevelopment of this important community hub will commence later this year.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We are investing $8.7 million in this important redevelopment which will result in a significant rejuvenation in the municipality of Glenorchy. The redevelopment includes health and wellness centres, including a hydrotherapy pool. It also includes a sports house and upgrades to the Glenorchy District Football Club facilities; a theatrette, a meeting room and training room; function rooms, including bar and bistro; cafe and commercial kitchen; changing rooms; kiosk and public amenities; transport museum shed; refurbished cricket training nets; multipurpose synthetic spots pitch; and a new pedestrian entrance and landscaping. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The new KGV precinct will also offer a new home to the Migrant Resource Centre. The Migrant Resource Centre is such a key service provider for migrants and refugees in Tasmania that it has outgrown its Hobart premises. Under the CEO, Cedric Mannen, and staff, the Migrant Resource Centre is a vibrant place and, with a base in the Glenorchy municipality where many migrants settle, I am sure the influence and value of the Migrant Resource Centre will only increase</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">Importantly, the King George V redevelopment complex will be open to all. I know the community will embrace the opportunity to make use of these first-class facilities. This important redevelopment, made possible thanks to the Gillard Labor government, will add another place for the community to gather, to participate in sport and wellbeingâ€”be it playing, supporting, celebrating or even meeting. I look forward to joining the community at the redeveloped KGV precinct, cheering on the Glenorchy Magpies, as well as seeing the great benefits of the other new facilities that will be open to all ages in Glenorchy's broader community. I thank those members of the community who have worked and lobbied to make this become a reality.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Another exciting initiative taking place in the municipality is the Glenorchy on the Go project. This program is run by the Glenorchy City Council, thanks to a $700,000 grant delivered by the Gillard Labor government under the Healthy Communities Initiative. Glenorchy on the Go is about improving the health and wellbeing of the people of Glenorchy. Glenorchy on the Go is a free program which encourages participants to be physically active, teaches them the importance of maintaining a healthy diet, and how best to go about this through cooking classes, walking groups, sports sessions for those with a disability and the development of community gardens.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">This program is as much about social interaction as it is about promoting healthy lifestyles. Glenorchy on the Go offers people who may otherwise be isolated within their community an opportunity to seek friendship and improve the quality of their health at the same time. To date, more than 575 people have participated in Glenorchy on the Go programs. Seventy-five per cent of these participants are over the age of 55 and one in seven of them have a disability. Currently Glenorchy on the Go offers 15 walking groups, 10 Heartmovesâ€”a gentle exercise groupâ€”and four sessions of sport ability for people with disability. There are also come and try activities such as archery, linedancing and bowls, and chronic health education sessions, which I understand will commence in March. I want to make special mention and commend the work of the Heart Foundation for their involvement in this project as they run the walking groups taking place around the Glenorchy municipality.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I was fortunate to attend the launch of Glenorchy on the Go. The community turned out in force. Together we spent about 10 minutes being put through our paces with some fun exercises and interactive movements. It was wonderful to hear the stories of those who have been involved with Glenorchy on the Go since its inception and to hear how people's energy levels have increased. I have also met with program coordinator, Elisa Ryan, and project manager, Len Yeats. Their enthusiasm is boundless. I have no doubt that this program will continue to build momentum and change lives, thanks to the passion of all those involved and the funding they received.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I want to acknowledge the work and dedication of former senator Margaret Reynolds, especially in her role as state director of National Disability Services, a post that she has recently moved on from. Margaret is well known in this place, having served as a Labor senator for Queensland from 1983 to 1999. Margaret served as the Minister for Local Government and also as the Minister assisting the Prime Minister for the Status of Women. History shows that Margaret made a valuable contribution during her time in this place and the Senate's loss has been Tasmania's gain as Margaret has now returned to her home state.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">In the 13 years since Margaret left this place, she has worked on many projects. In East Timor, Fiji and Africa she worked to give women an understanding of decision-making at local, national and international levels. In Australia, Margaret engaged with young people, encouraging them to engage with our democracy and to be active and involved with the political process, particularly through Youth Parliament. Margaret was President of the United Nations Association of Australia at a time when the international community were struggling to understand why Australia needed to send what was considered a small number of asylum seekers to isolated detention centres.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I had the privilege of serving on the National Council for the United Nations Association of Australia with Margaret and also at a local level in the Tasmanian branch of the UNAA. I also served under Margaret's chairing of the Tasmanian Women's Council to help improve access and equality for women in Tasmania. Margaret has also written two books. Margaret gave me a copy of her book <span style="font-style:italic;">The last bastion</span> for my 30th birthday, now some 10 years ago, before I entered state parliament. It was a great read about the challenges facing women in political life and gave me a good understanding of the challenges which lay ahead for me. I have regarded Margaret as a mentor and a friend. She has certainly inspired me to want to be in this place, and if I can make the kind of contribution she made in this place then I would certainly have achieved a great deal.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">In 2004, Margaret accepted a position with National Disability Services, Australia's peak body representing disability service providers, and she retired from this role just last week. Through hard work, Margaret and her colleagues across Tasmania and Australia put disability services firmly on the political agenda. She began this role at a time when mental institutions were closing in a bid to give intellectually disabled people the opportunity to live in their community, yet little money was directed towards supporting this endeavour. Margaret retires at a time when disability reform is firmly on the government's agendaâ€”with the National Disability Insurance Scheme set to become a reality under the Gillard Labor government.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Margaret will continue her contribution to the Australian community as chair of the Australian Centre of Excellence in Local Government. She will also build upon her good work in disability reform as a member of the National People with Disability and Carers Council. I wish Margaret well and thank her very much for what I know will be an ongoing contribution to the Australian community.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">
                  <a href="H6X" type="MemberSpeech">
                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Senator BIRMINGHAM</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">South Australia</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">19:31</span>):  One of the first issues I addressed in the parliament was the future of the River Murray. It was partly out of my own personal concerns for better management of the Murray, it was partly as a result of it being the top issue confronting people in my home state of South Australia and it was partly a result of the groundbreaking announcement made by then Prime Minister John Howard in his Australia Day speech of 2007 committing to deliver national management of the Murray-Darling Basin.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">John Howard sought to end 120 years of argument and mismanagement by the states that saw the resources of the basin over allocated. He budgeted $10 billion to make the transition to a sustainable, national plan happen and he passed the Water Act through this parliament to provide the legislative framework in which the development of that national basin plan could occur. Murray-Darling reform was the last great reform of the Howard years. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I was passionate as a new, young senator about seeing it implemented when I came to this place in 2007 and I remain passionate about seeing it implemented today. That is why I am concerned that this important reform appears to be at risk, thanks to chronic mismanagement and severely misdirected funding by the Labor government that took power shortly after the passage of the Water Act in 2007. This mismanagement is creating a crisis of confidence in the water reform agenda across the communities of the Murray-Darling Basin, upstream and downstream. Of the $10 billion allocated, Labor has spent in excess of $1.7 billion on water buybacks but only $650 million on infrastructure. This is actually the inverse of what had been intended under the Howard plan in terms of the proportionate spending. Indeed, much of the so-called infrastructure spending for water saving projects is not spending on water saving infrastructure projects at all. Much of the spending on so-called infrastructure does not return water to the system. In fact, the government's spending total even includes management costs for the bureaucracy associated with the Commonwealth Environmental Water Holder and the costs of the advertising campaigns that have been undertaken on water reform by the governmentâ€”hardly infrastructure projects at all.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Minister for Sustainability, Environment, Water, Population and Communities Tony Burke in particular is losing the confidence of stakeholders in all parts of the basin, upstream and downstream. A constant failure to deliver on the infrastructure projects that I have mentioned has diminished confidence throughout the basin, especially for those looking for water recovery that best maintains levels of food production in Australia. The growth of food in Australia by Australians, for Australians and for our export market is something that people throughout Australia are really passionate about. They want to see that when government embarks on recovering water for the environment it does so in a way that keeps food production happening throughout our prime agricultural lands, especially those of the Murray-Darling.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Labor promised to the downstream states, and South Australia in particular, that they would deliver John Howard's water reforms and they have campaigned on it at two elections, but all the words and slogans in the world cannot hide their failure to deliver. The recently broken promise to freeze buybacks in the southern basin has seriously damaged confidence among irrigation communities in New South Wales, Victoria and South Australia. For example, the Victorian Farmers Federation last week expressed its shock at learning that Minister Burke without any consultation had launched yet another buyback in breach of the promise. The VFF highlighted that Mr Burke promised just last November that the Gillard government would not just wade into the water market and that they see this as a 'random scatter-gun approach that risks the viability of irrigation communities throughout the southern basin'.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The conduct of the minister and his newly appointed chair of the Murray-Darling Basin Authority after the release of the guide also raised false expectations in many irrigation communities that the draft plan may have significantly less impact on them than the guide that had been released 12 months earlier. The shattering of those false hopes when the draft plan was released late last year further dented confidence in this reform agenda and in those delivering it. Meanwhile, the failure to adequately explain what the environmental implications and differences are of the different sustainable diversion limit reductionsâ€”such as the 3,000, 3,500 or 4,000 gigalitre figures mooted in the guide to the plan or the 2,750 gigalitre figure proposed in the draft planâ€”has all hurt confidence, especially in downstream states, such as mine of South Australia.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Another issue for confidence in the plan is the constant delays with the draft plan now having been delayed five timesâ€”and it appears unlikely that the basin plan will be finalised much before the very end of this year, if at all. We see that the ultimate implementation of the Murray-Darling Basin national plan has been dragged out from a 2014 implementation date to a 2019 implementation date. These delays have also hurt confidence. We also have the unexplained explosion in allowable groundwater extractions, which has drawn criticism from the likes of the Wentworth Group of Concerned Scientists and thereby undermined the confidence of those looking for environmental outcomes. Indeed, the increased allowable extraction of groundÂ­water of around 2,600 gigalitres is comparable to the proposed surface water extraction cuts of 2,750 gigalitresâ€”a change that has been ill-explained and, again, undermines the confidence of people in this process. We now have a crisis of confidence that has manifested itself in unhelpful threats that jeopardise these reformsâ€”threats that come from the states, both upstream and downstream.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">South Australian Premier, Jay Weatherill, has threatened a High Court challenge to any plan he considers unsatisfactory, saying in October:</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Small">... if there is not an adequate response in relation to the Murray-Darling Basin plan, South Australia will pursue its rights in relation to the river system.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">In November, New South Wales retaliated by threatening to withdraw altogether, with Minister for Primary Industries, Katrina Hodgkinson, saying:</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Small">... we will not support a plan that is not in the best interest of NSW, our primary producers and Basin communities.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">So we have counterthreats now coming from the states. It seems that not only can Labor not agree on who should be the Prime Minister but South Australian state and federal Labor representatives cannot agree on the process of basin reform.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Basin reform faces a lot of challenges and needs real commitment and leadership if it is going to succeed. The Prime Minister likes to tell South Australians that she is one of us and understands the importance of basin reform, but, on performance to date, South Australians just cannot trust her words. As Kevin Rudd said of the Prime Minister just a few days ago, 'Julia has lost the trust of the Australian people.' With such a crisis of confidence, it may be time for the Prime Minister to look for a new face to handle the Water portfolio. It may be time for the Prime Minister to look at who the minister for water is as she undertakes the reshuffle caused by the warfare in Labor ranks. It may be time for the Prime Minister to look to the Minister for Sustainability, Environment, Water, Population and Communities, Tony Burke, having lost the confidence of upstream and downstream states and having lost the confidence of those concerned about the environment and those concerned about irrigation and food production. Is it time for him to be moved on? Perhaps it is time for Minister Burke to be moved on and have a fresh face appointed to restore both upstream and downstream confidence in Murray-Darling reforms.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Perhaps someone like the member for Port Adelaide, Minister Mark Butler, should be appointed. Perhaps Mr Butler could get his long-time factional friend, Jay Weatherill, the Premier of SA, onside. Perhaps Mr Butler could convince Mr Weatherill to drop his threats and, in turn, convince the New South Wales government to drop their counterthreats. Perhaps Mr Butler could also provide reassurance to South Australians that this plan will actually make for a healthier river. Alternatively, perhaps Minister Chris Bowen would find the politics of waterâ€”not exactly an easy areaâ€”a walk in the park compared to the politics of the Immigration portfolio that he seems to eager to leave.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Whatever the Prime Minister does, this reform must be put back on track and 120 years of arguments must be brought to an end. This parliament must finish what John Howard started in 2007 and deliver a fair, balanced national plan for the Murray-Darling that secures the health of both our river system and the communities who rely on it. All I ask of the Prime Minister, at least for this week, is that she makes sure she has a minister for water who has the confidence of communities to deliver on this objective.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">New South Wales</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">19:41</span>):  All women should have the right to access abortion services with privacy and dignity and without harassment and intimidation. As we approach International Women's Day, this issue remains very relevant. Over the past week, just a few blocks from my office in Sydney, there has been a gaggle of protesters stationed outside an abortion clinic. There is a very large banner urging people to pray and fast for an end to abortion, and there are leaflets. I can only guess what disturbing images and guilt-making rhetoric they may contain. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">This clinic and others throughout Australia are being targeted as part of the 40 Days for Life campaign. This campaign was started in 2007 by a US based antichoice group. It calls for people to spend the 40 days of Lent praying outside abortion clinics. On the website they list their so-called achievements since 2007: 21 abortion facilities completely shut down following local 40 Days for Life campaigns; 61 abortion workers have quit their jobs and walked away from the abortion industry; and reports document 5,045 lives have been spared from abortion.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">In 1980 I was working with some women's organisations and was also part of the New South Wales Women's Advisory Council. I was often approached about this very issue. I vividly remember taking calls from extremely distressed women who had faced lines of protesters and had been harassed, intimidated, often abused and sometimes obstructed from walking to and from clinics, all because they had made the choice to visit an abortion centre. It is 20 years on and it is deeply sad that not much seems to have changed. The decision to have an abortion is not easy for women. Women and their partners deserve privacy, dignity and security when visiting clinics.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Governments in parts of Canada and the US have sought to limit the presence of protesters through what have become known as 'bubble zones'. Bubble zone legislation creates a physical zone around a clinic that protesters may not enter or where there are conditions on speech or action. Their purpose is to provide for the safety of patients and workers at abortion clinics, ensure safe access to health care and ensure privacy and dignity for those involved. Acting to create bubble zones would be a proactive and clear step that governments and local councils around Australia could take up to protect women's rights. In resÂ­ponse to 40 Days for Life, there is a growing movement of women turning 40 Days for Life into '40 days of treats', taking baked treats into the clinics for workers and patients to show solidarity and hopefully go some way to neutralising the effect of having to run the gauntlet outside. I congratulate these women and, when I get back to Sydney, I will certainly take a baked treat up the road, past the protesters, the banner and the leaflets, and through the front door. I would like to move on to the issue of International Women's Day. As a woman MP, I have many reasons to celebrate InterÂ­national Women's Day. One hundred and two years ago, courageous women kicked off what today is arguably the most famous and influential of international events. Reflecting on the history of International Women's Day is a reminder of how equality for women has been won through struggle and sacrifice. I pay tribute to our forebears who have campaigned for women's rights. It is a great credit to these women, and the men that have supported their campaigns, that today people of diverse political persuasions come together to mark IWD. It is a day that has a rich and proud history. It has been a century of sacrifices and achievements.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">International Women's Day was initiated as a strategy to promote equal rights. The proposal was put forward in August 1910 at an international women's conference that preceded the general meeting of the socialist Second International in Copenhagen. The 8th of March was chosen, as on the same date in 1848 the King of Prussia had promised votes for women. Interestingly, though, the promise had been made but not kept and so the women decided to revive that date. Clara Zetkin, a famous leader of the social democrat women's movement in Germany, moved the motion. In March 1911, the first IWD rallies were held and our sisters certainly went into action. History records that over one million participated in rallies and meetings in Austria, Denmark, Germany and Switzerland. In Vienna, women honoured the martyrs in the Paris Commune. Today, International Women's Day is celebrated around the world and is a national holiday in many countries, including Afghanistan, Russia, China, Uganda, Madagascar, Cuba and many countries in Central and South-East Asia.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Born at a time of great social turbulence and crisis, International Women's Day has a rich history of protest and political activism. At the beginning of the 20th century, women in industrially developing countries were entering paid work in large numbers. The jobs were sex segregated, mainly in textiles, manufacturing and domestic services, where conditions were shameful and wages were low. Many of the changes taking place in women's lives pushed against the political restrictions surrounding them.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The first IWD event in Australia took place in Sydney's Domain on 25 March 1928. Organised by the Militant Women's Movement, the key demands were for equal pay for equal work, an eight-hour day for shop workers, no piecework, the basic wage for the unemployed and annual holidays on full pay. The movement spread, especially among trade union women. Equal pay, including for servicewomen, became a major issue during the war years from 1940 to 1945. IWD was a continuing vehicle for discussion about the key issues of equal pay and child care, but the main emphasis was on the war effort, including support for women's resistance in occupied countries and campaigns such as Medical Aid to Russia. In 1944, issues such as housing and education and the rights of Aboriginal women were being raised at IWD events.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">In the years after the war, women's pay rates were generally set at 75 per cent of the male rate. Many of the comprehensive full-day nurseries and other childcare centres which had appeared during the war started disappearing, with federal funding being cut to such projects. These discriminatory practices were taken up by International Women's Day committees.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">This brings us to the Cold War period. During the 1950s, politics of all kinds were played out against a background of intolerÂ­ance and dwindling democratic practice. It was a time during which anticommunism was used to smother political dissent or to vilify opponents. A one-off development was that left and radical groups, including International Women's Day committees, were often refused the use of public halls.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I remember International Women's Day rallies in the 1960s and the early 1970s, when small groups of women rallied in Australian cities. They often faced bigotry, harassment and discrimination when they celebrated and protested to mark InterÂ­national Women's Day. I would like to thank some of the women who were involved and inspired me throughout my political life: Mary Wright, Ina Heidtman, Audrey Macdonald, Joyce Stevens, Freda Brown, Edna Ryan, Paula Sharkey, Jessie Street, Vera Deacon, Kath Walker, Henrietta Greville and Della Elliott. Their contribuÂ­tions to women's struggle has been immense.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">International Women's Day continues in so many forms. An exciting year that I remÂ­ember was 1975 because it was in the prevÂ­ious year that International Women's Day was for the first time officially recogÂ­nised, and it was by the Gough Whitlam governÂ­ment. Then, in 1975, the start of InternaÂ­tional Women's Decade, thousands and thousands of women came to the streets for the first time in such large numbers in Australia to celebrate International Women's Day.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Now International Women's Day provides a common day for globally recognising and celebrating women's achievements. As I said in my opening remarks, there is still so much to be done to ensure that women's full equality is achieved in terms of our rights at work, our rights in the home, our health rights and our education rights. But I do warmly congratulate the women who have achieved so much for those of us who stand here today.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">
                  <a href="204953" type="MemberSpeech">
                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Senator GALLACHER</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">South Australia</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">19:50</span>):  Last week I had the pleasure of attending Building the Education Revolution program openings in the electorate of Grey. In that period I was also able to visit various people and organisations in order to get a better understanding of the communities they work closely with. In that time I was amazed by the hard work and passion of many individuals who have dediÂ­cated their lives to their communities. This is very obvious when travelling in regional areas; you truly feel a sense of community. I believe this sense of community is at the core of regional Australians, and this is a reason why the Australian Labor Party has a key focus on regional communities and putting investment back into them.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Regional Australia is often held back by distance but also by the lack of investment made by governments of all persuasions, and this has certainly changed under a Labor government. Regional Australia also faces challenges not seen in urban Australia. For example, certain schools have a particular number of students coming from a position of severe disadvantage, often stemming from entrenched unemployment.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">In light of these challenges, communities unite and are strengthened. Leaders emerge out of this to the benefit of the children, individuals and families they engage with. One of the schools that I visited was Flinders View Primary School. The school received just over $2 million for classrooms, a shade structure and school refurbishments as part of the Building the Education Revolution, which according to the opposition is a waste of taxpayers' money. I suggest the coalition go to this particular school and say it was a waste of money because, in fact, it is a prime example of opportunity created for the school and the children. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Flinders View Primary School is in Port Augusta with over 70 per cent of the children coming from Indigenous Australian families. It was explained to me that these children come from very disadvantaged backgrounds, and, although the parents of these students recognise the importance of education, there are some that do not make it a priority for their children. This has meant the school has had to work exceptionally hard with not just the core of education, numeracy and literacy, but in areas like making sure the students are eating correctly and arriving on time. These sound simple to many of us, but are signifiÂ­cant in a child's development. This school has worked hard in creating a community within, where students are made to feel like they are a part of a bigger family, and to keep the students coming to school and arriving on time.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The school is also working exceptionally hard in engaging with parents so they work with the school to improve outcomes for their children's education. One person who is really driving these objectives is the school principal, Mrs Anna Nayda. Her dedication to the school is second to none. It is not just her devotion to the school but her dedication to the children which is simply amazing. The sense of community that you get in the school has meant that past students are always welcomed back. I must also acknowledge her deputy, Bec Mueller, and all the teachers working exceptionally hard to make a difference to these children.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">It was also interesting to note that the new classrooms went to an early childhood learning centre. The reason for this was quite simple: Indigenous children are allowed to start kindergarten at three years of age rather than at the normal four years of age. This new state-of-the-art facility for very young children is to get them into the facility at a younger age. It is a wonderful development and I am sure will be of benefit to students and the community.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The second school I visited was Solomontown Primary School at Port Pirie and this is also a school that faces very significant challenges. This school not only has students from disadvantaged backÂ­grounds but also a reasonably high number of disabled students. Like Flinders View Primary School, there is a dedicated bunch of staffâ€”including the new principal, Sandra Mauger, who is driven to get results. The school is very picturesque. It was built in 1897. Twenty-first-century facilities have been brought into a beautiful historic building. The once-in-a-lifetime BER spend on this school was $2.6 millionâ€”on refurbished classrooms and library. While the principal was walking the dignitaries around the school, she stated, 'This was a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity that we would never, ever believe could happen.' The school community and the parents are so proud of the new facilities; it gives the students a sense of pride in their school. Hopefully, with this infrastructure, numeracy and literacy will improve. This is something that the principal stressed personally to me.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">On this trip I was able to visit many other community groups, in particular, the Port Augusta RSL. Again this is a group of passionate individuals often dedicating their time and work to something they believe in. A real testament to the work of the members of the RSL is their outstanding museum. There is no doubt that the members have worked extremely hard in building that facility to the condition it is in today. The Labor government, through the Veteran and Community Grants program, has aided the RSL of Port Augusta with a grant of nearly $50,000 to refurbish their ablution facilities. This will further develop the everyday infrastructure of this wonderful RSL, which will be a benefit to the community, the wider public and many of the school children in the area who utilise the museum for school excursions. I urge all Australians travelling through Port Augusta to stop by and visit this great museum. You cannot miss the building; there is a huge tank sitting right out the front. I must congratulate President Mario Caresimo of the Port Augusta RSL on the success of the branch, and I thank Frank Florvat for showing us around.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Finally, I would like to speak about the UnitingCare Wesley Men's Shed in Port Pirie. I have previously spoken about the Men's Shed in this place when speaking about the Regional Australia Development Fund. It is a fantastic initiative which will support many disadvantaged students and individuals within that community. I was able to sit in with some of the Men's Shed volunteers who just finished their weekly meeting. These men are at different stages of their lives but what brings them together is their desire to help the community. Some of the initiatives involve bringing kids without a male role model in their lives into the shed and simply teaching them basic skills. They are mentors to individuals who are disadvanÂ­taged or who simply need some company. The men's shed is also involved in skills training for unemployed and disadvantaged individuals through UnitingCare Wesley.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">One person I would like to mention is Gus Wohlschlager, who has been awarded the AOM for his volunteer work. This is another great example of a passionate individual working hard to bring a community together. He volunteered his time to the Port Pirie Regional Health Service as a transport driver; Port Pirie Regional Council community as a bus driver; UnitingCare Wesley as a truck driver; and as a Men's Shed volunteer in the position of coordinator and fundraiser. Gus is a former emergency service volunteer; former community bus driver for the Port Pirie Regional Council and State Emergency Service; and, finally, a patron, driver and committee member of the Special Olympics, Port Pirie, since 2004.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">These are fantastic stories that show the dedication many regional Australians have to their communities. It also shows the great work the Gillard Labor government is doing in regional Australia, providing infraÂ­structure that would otherwise have been a great burden for the community to fund. I enjoy bringing these stories to parliament and feel that it is so important to give the recognition necessary to celebrate these individuals and their communities. I can only thank these individuals and communities for telling their story to me.</span>
