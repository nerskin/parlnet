<para>—Senator Milne is the clear choice for this position if we are to take seriously this role of President of the Senate, and I do. The role is constitutionally the most important that any parliamentarian in either house can hold. It requires a person with great experience, and that includes public experience and, if possible, national and international experience. And it requires somebody who is going to serve this Senate without fear or favour, and Senator Milne would certainly do that. She is a candidate of enormous integrity and has a fearless ability to be honest and to be fair—qualities which are essential to a chair of the Senate. Senator Milne, besides 10 years parliamentary experience in Tasmania where, amongst other things, she very successfully led the party in the balance of power in the late 1990s, has now been in this chamber for a year more than a term and knows very well how it works and knows more particularly how better it should work. I point out that she was also Vice-President of the World Conservation Union in Switzerland—a United Nations associated body—for some years. She has also been chair of the global council of the World Conservation Union and remains chair of the Oceania chapter of the council. She is also a United Nations Global 500 award recipient.</para>
</talk.start>
<para>I ask senators of the government and the opposition to listen carefully to this. This job should not be a sinecure. The arrangement between the government and the opposition whereby one takes the chair and one takes the deputy chair does not serve this Senate properly. The best person should be appointed and voted to the chair, and this should be a free vote. It should not be corralled by a cosy arrangement between the two big parties in this place. It is time that ended. That does not serve this Senate fairly or well, and the Greens—</para>

She is the best candidate and I recommend her to all of you as voters with your own right to think individually rather than according to the dictate of party as to how you are going to appoint this chair.</para>

<para>—Firstly, I would like to acknowledge the traditional owners on whose land we meet. I think that is so important. Then I would like to thank the senators who have just placed their trust in me and given their support. I am honest, I am fair, and I am sure that as time progresses those who might not believe that will find it to be true.</para>
</talk.start>
<para>On the occasion of being elected to this very high office indeed, I think it is an opportunity to reflect on my path here. In particular, I think that one does not get here by one’s good looks, charm, personality, political skills, wit or any other devices. One really achieves office—whether it be as a senator, whether it be as the President or whether it be as any other officer in this place—by virtue of a wide range of support that has been lent to one over a long period of time.</para>
<para>I think that is something that we should never overlook in our successes in life—that we never get there solely by ourselves. So I want to firstly acknowledge my party and those loyal people in the party who have elected me through our state council process to be a candidate for the party over a long period of time. I have witnessed in this place a number of senators who have not been so successful in their preselection processes, and of course it is a sad occasion indeed. The people who put you here are important, to say the least.</para>
<para>I want to thank my caucus colleagues, and I notice, in particular, that some of the members of the House of Representatives have ventured here this afternoon. Again, without their support, I would not stand before you. From my own state, I want to recognise Anthony Chisholm, the state secretary, and I have enjoyed the support of a number of state secretaries over a long period of time. I owe my success in part to my party. But, next, I want to acknowledge the electors of Queensland. Rightly or wrongly, in the minds of some people, they have returned me now on three occasions to this place, a great honour indeed.</para>
<para>I next wish to acknowledge my union. I am a proud unionist and always have been. In particular, my union, the SDA, has a long and proud tradition which has been fostered in my time with the union particularly by Jim Maher, who unfortunately cannot be here today, and Joe de Bruyn, who is the national secretary. Without my union, without the opportunities that my union gave to me, coming from a very humble background indeed, I would not stand before you. I next want to thank Chris Ketter, who is the current Queensland branch secretary of the SDA, for his long-term friendship and support of me. Also, last but not least from my union, I want to acknowledge Wally Major. Wally is represented by his daughter Joan here today. Wally was the person who fatefully gave me the job with the SDA over 32 years ago.</para>
<para>Again, as I said, one does not get here by one’s own good looks, talents or whatever else, and an enduring friendship with the Australian Workers Union and Bill Ludwig, who represents them here today, has been of great assistance to me in my career over a long period of time. I want to mention ‘Sciaccas’. Con Sciacca, Sciaccas Lawyers and his former partner, the Hon. Brian Kilmartin, who is now a magistrate, have supported me and given me great counsel over a long period of time.</para>
<para>Now I want to mention a name that will not mean a great deal to people outside of the SDA—a person who has given me great strength and courage over a long period of time by the name of Jim Cosgrave of Cosgrave Management Consultants, who taught me how to be patient and how to think in a positive way in developing the skills that I may well have. I thank my staff, Julie Christensen and Hazel Hubbard—who have endured me for 12 years as their employer and without whom my office would not have run successfully over that period of time—Darrell Main and of course Julia Clifford and Meredith Horne in Canberra.</para>
<para>I now turn to my family, because in this game unless you have the support of your family you are not going to make it. I have been extremely blessed with my family and the support that they have given me. It would be a proud moment if my late parents were alive, but obviously they are long gone. But my sister, Mary, is here. I thank you, Mary, for your support. I thank my son, Stephen, my daughter Elizabeth and my daughter Louise. You have been wonderful. You have put up with me through all of my union career and political career. I thank you for that. But the really solid rock has been my wife, Sue. Sue, you are amazing. As I said, this speech is about the people who have supported me over a long period of time; you have been a tower of strength to me and you have enabled me to achieve what I have achieved. I salute you and love you.</para>
<para>It is not possible in a brief speech such as this to thank and encompass everyone. But I think I have made my point that it was not done by me alone and that it was done with the support and cooperation of a wide group of people. Having said that, I make special mention of the two former presidents that I have served under: Alan Ferguson and Paul Calvert. In my time as Deputy President of the Senate they extended a hand of friendship to me that broke down party barriers, not that there were any party barriers in this particular high office. In particular, thank you to you, Alan. This period has not been easy for Alan and me. We knew that there was going to be a transition, but it has worked wonderfully indeed for both of us. I thank you, Alan.</para>
<para>Last but not least, I want to remind people that I come from very humble circumstances. I am proud of my heritage. Those who dig into my background will find that I have a great-great-grandfather who was a politician. He was the subject of Steele Rudd’s notice in <inline font-style="italic">Dad in politics</inline>, which goes back to the turn of the century. I never thought that I had anyone of that character in my background, but obviously I do and obviously it is reincarnated here today.</para>
<para>I look forward to working with all senators in a cooperative manner in the future. I am sure that we can make this chamber work in spite of the changing dynamics within it. I look forward to the challenges. Thank you very much.</para>

<para>—Mr President, on behalf of all senators, and particularly on behalf of government senators, I congratulate you on your election to the very important office of President of the Senate. It is one of the most important offices in the Australian democracy. It is important that the person elected to that position takes their function and role very seriously. We know that you will. I think you are superbly qualified for the position. You have served an apprenticeship as Deputy President of the Senate, which I think will serve you well in the role.</para>
</talk.start>
<para>More importantly, I think it is because you have a reputation as being a very honest operator, a person of integrity, a person of mature judgement and a person who is balanced and conscientious—all qualities that I think are important for the role of President—that the Senate has shown the good judgement in electing you to this position. Your reputation for those qualities is accepted across the chamber, despite political differences and arguments. I think people accept you as being a good choice for the position, not just as a reflection of party numbers or convention.</para>
<para>I do acknowledge the role of the opposition in supporting the convention of the President coming from the government party. I congratulate them on honouring that convention. I have yet to check whether Senator McGauran also honoured that convention, but when we go to the ballots later we will see.</para>

<para>—There was one informal vote, I understand! That was not meant as any inappropriate remark in relation to Senator McGauran; it was just a reflection on an earlier event. But, Mr President, I congratulate you on your election. I look forward to you dealing with what I think will be a large challenge for you in the new Senate. It will place pressure on you. But I think your standing in the Senate will serve you well in that role. I am sure you will do the job admirably.</para>
</talk.start>
</continue>
<para>I would also briefly like to mention the service of Senator Ferguson as President. I think he did an excellent job. His humour and openness were a great credit to him. I acknowledge his integrity, in the face of being a member of the government that had the numbers in the Senate. It meant that he was able to do that job despite what I know would have been pressures for him to be more supportive of the government’s position. They are only natural pressures that occur in the job for any President, but I think the fact that he was able to maintain his reputation for impartiality despite those pressures is to his great credit.</para>
<para>So, Mr President, I congratulate you on your election. I think it was in part due to the shortness of your campaign speech! But there are other factors that served you well in this election, and we wish you all the best.</para>

<para>—Mr President, on behalf of opposition senators I warmly congratulate you on your election to this very high office. Your election, of course, for opposition senators, does reflect the disappointing reality that the Australian people decided to change the government at the last election. But it also reflects, as Senator Evans observed, the fact that our opposition does respect the convention that the government of the day should nominate the President of this chamber. We congratulate the Labor Party on nominating the best possible candidate that they could nominate, in you, Mr President, for this exalted position.</para>
</talk.start>
<para>I must say that, for a Labor senator, you have done a remarkably good job as Deputy President of the Senate for the last six years. You have earned widespread respect from across the chamber. I and many others on our side have had the privilege of working closely with you—and, indeed, of voting with you on some of the more significant and difficult moral issues that come before this chamber. Many of us know and respect you personally from that experience. Your carriage of the office of Deputy President stands you in good stead and does reflect the fact that you are an outstanding candidate for President. I have no doubt you will do a great job. We do expect from you, and no doubt will get from you, the independence, the objectivity and the impartiality that is incumbent on the bearer of the great office of President. We do hope very much that you will enjoy this great office until August 2011—when, with great respect, we on this side look forward to you being succeeded by a Liberal senator! But enjoy the time until then. Thank you, Mr President.</para>

<para>—On behalf of opposition senators, I warmly congratulate Senator Ferguson on his unopposed election as Deputy President. I should note for the record that it reflects well on Senator Ferguson and the stature that he has in this chamber that he was unopposed as both the Liberal nominee for the position of Deputy President and indeed, I am pleased to say, as the chamber nominee for Deputy President. I thank the government for respecting the convention to which we earlier referred that has as its flipside that the opposition nominates the person for the deputy chair. We thank the Labor Party for respecting that convention.</para>
</talk.start>
<para>Of course, we are on our side, as I said in June, disappointed that Senator Ferguson was not able to continue in the position of President. He had but 12 months in that high office in which he demonstrated great dignity, impartiality and presence. He has of course been superbly trained for the position of Deputy President, having served as President. Indeed, as I understand it, there are only four senators in the history of this chamber who have served in both positions, and Senator Ferguson creates history today by being the first to go from President to Deputy President! So your name will be in the history books, Senator Ferguson. I have no doubt that across the chamber we all understand and expect that he will serve with great dignity and professionalism in the position of deputy chair.</para>

<para>—I add my congratulations, Senator Hogg, on your elevation to President. The government has a very simple approach to trying to rein in inflation, unlike those opposite. This is a government that has inherited the highest level of inflation in 16 years. Those opposite remain in denial about the legacy that they have left ordinary Australians. Those opposite’s solution in the fight against inflation is to irresponsibly blow holes in the budget surplus. That budget surplus has helped the Reserve Bank to indicate that interest rates will possibly be reduced in the future. The Reserve Bank have done that because they have confidence that they have a government that is not asleep at the wheel. They are confident that they have a government that is up to the challenge of tackling interest rates and inflation. They are confident that they have a government that has introduced a responsible budget surplus that has taken some of the pressure off inflation and off interest rate increases. That is why they have given an indication that the interest rate environment is softening in this country. That is because of the responsible economic management adopted by those on this side of the chamber, not the cheap and populist panderings that are going on on the other side from those who have completely walked away from any pretence that they were responsible economic managers. I appreciate that, given that they had allowed the interest rates and inflation to grow and grow and grow—</para>

<para>The Prime Minister and the opposition leader, Mr Nelson, had the pleasure this morning of welcoming home Australia’s Olympic team from Beijing. Senators would be aware of the tremendous success that those athletes enjoyed at the games.

It is a great credit to the team, the coaches and all those who supported the team. Australians rightly take great pride in the results of our Olympic team and all senators will join me in congratulating them on their performance and the way they represented Australia.</para>
<para>While I am sure we all had many highlights during the last few weeks, for me Matthew Mitcham in the diving was a fantastic thing to watch, along with Steve Hooker in the pole vault and Anna Meares in the cycling, as much for the courage as for the performance, taking into account the history of her struggle. One of my favourite moments was also of Grant Hackett winning the silver medal. The sportsmanship and style that he displayed was a credit to him and to the country and to his role as a captain of the team.</para>
<para>I am sure that, like me and my family, a lot of senators have been glued to the television in recent weeks. My family have had discussions and they are now particularly expert in diving. They all have a view on the points awarded in diving. They did not know anything about it two weeks ago, but we now have very strong arguments. We were convinced that Matthew Mitcham should have won the gold, so we got that one right.</para>
<para>While we have a focus on the results, and it is a tremendous day to congratulate the team, I think we also ought to focus on the whole team’s contribution—the sacrifice, the dedication and the honour they brought to Australia in their performance in representing the country. I would also like to recognise all those who tried out for the team, those who provided the competition in allowing us to field the best possible team.</para>
<para>As the Minister for Immigration and Citizenship I want to note that more than 40 athletes who competed for and represented Australia were born overseas. Athletes born in Algeria, Iran, the USA, China, England, Yugoslavia and Malawi all competed on behalf of Australia and did us proud. I think that is a great recognition of Australia’s capacity to receive immigrants and make them part of our country. We are actually very quick to give citizenship to good athletes in this country.</para>
<para>I want to particularly mention the fact that the elite sportspeople are nurtured not only by our sporting systems and the investment we place in them but also by parents, family, friends and coaches who contribute at the junior level. Every weekend when I am down watching my sons play soccer I see people giving of their time to junior sporting teams and associations and who usually do not get much recognition. The Olympics is the end product of the sort of effort they all make in encouraging our children to compete in sport.</para>
<para>I would like to congratulate, on behalf of the government and I think the whole Senate, all those who participated in representing Australia. They did do us proud and we are all very grateful for their efforts. <inline font-style="italic">(Time expired)</inline>

<para>—Those opposite might want to try and play games about their intentions about various pieces of legislation, but they have one simple choice to make: are they going to assist Australians and help take pressure off interest rates and inflation by passing the government’s budget, or are they going to continue to play the role of spoilers? That is the choice that they have to make a decision on. I appreciate that this is caught up in a whole range of leadership debates on the other side. Who can take a shot—whether Mr Turnbull or Mr Nelson can win the battle, that is what this debate has turned into on their side. No thought for all of those Australians who have been struggling because of rising interest rates, rising petrol prices, rising grocery prices—all because of an electoral binge and a burst in government spending by those on the other side.</para>

<para>—Mr President, may I extend my congratulations to you and to Senator Ferguson on your election. The Labor Party makes no apology whatsoever for putting working families first. The centrepiece of our first budget, a budget which we now see those opposite seeking to destroy, was a $55 billion family package. We also have to recognise that one of the best ways of supporting Australian families is by laying a strong economic foundation for Australian industry. That is why we are so determined that the budget should be fiscally responsible. And that is why we have offset new spending measures with savings of $33 billion over four years. That is why we are ready to ensure that we do tackle the growing and glaring anomalies on the revenue side which are increasing the excise exemption on condensate, which has long outlived the purpose for which it was originally given. That is why we have lifted the luxury car tax—a measure which is expected to raise an additional $555 million over four years.</para>
</talk.start>
<para>This budget demonstrates this government’s willingness to take tough decisions in the national interest. That is why we achieved the $22 billion surplus Australia needed to put downward pressure on inflation. The previous government—this is the legacy of those opposite—left this country with the great parting gift of an inflation rate running at some four per cent: a 16-year high. One can understand that they do not care about that, because they never look beyond tomorrow.</para>
<para>This is a government that does care. Our focus is on Australia’s long-term future. We understand that inflation is bad for Australian business. It makes costs unpredictable and planning for the future very difficult. It does increase risks. It also increases prices. It increases the price of capital. The point appeared to have been lost on the member for Higgins when he engineered 10 interest rate hikes in five years. High interest rates do not just hurt homebuyers and families; they also hurt business. They directly affect every firm’s bottom line and they put upward pressure on the Australian dollar, which makes our exporters less competitive.</para>
<para>The government has been making tackling inflation a policy priority because we want to give Australian families a fair go. We want to give Australian business a fair go and we want to give the Australian economy a fair go, too, in an uncertain international environment. We want to ensure that while allowing our businesses to prosper in these difficult times. And that is at the heart of this government’s budget strategy. What the opposition are trying to do is to destroy that strategy. They are displaying the same indifference to Australian industry in opposition that they showed in government. This is the time when we should stop trying to score short-term political points and start thinking about this country’s future.</para>

<name role="display">Senator WONG</name>
</talker>
<para>—Thank you, Mr President. I, also, congratulate both you and Senator Ferguson on your election and add my strong support for both of those results. I thank Senator Minchin for his question and start by making the point that the situation in the Lower Lakes is extremely serious. The government is acutely aware of that. It is a situation which is driven by three factors. The first is a history of overallocation—a history of inaction by governments such as the one comprised of those opposite. There was a failure to address the overallocation of the Murray-Darling Basin while they were in government. There was not a single drop of water purchased by the Howard government for the purposes of restoring the health of the Murray-Darling. That is the first situation.</para>
</talk.start>
<para>The second factor is the unprecedented drought we are experiencing. The third factor is climate change, where unfortunately we are seeing historic low inflows and historic low rainfall, although I am sure we are all grateful there has been some rainfall around the Lower Lakes region in recent weeks. But we have had a period of extremely low rainfall and even lower inflow—that is, water flowing into the River Murray—which is exacerbating this problem. And this really presages what will happen if this country fails to deal with climate change. Just a statistic that emphasises where we are at: the two years prior to the Rudd government’s election had the lowest inflows into the River Murray in the nation’s history and they were in excess of 40 per cent lower than the previous lows.</para>
<para>So, what are we doing for the Lower Lakes? Well, we are not simply offering $50 million; we have put down $200 million for the South Australian government to develop an enduring response to the long-term environmental problems facing the Coorong and the Lower Lakes; we have already announced, in addition to that, $120 million for an integrated network of pipes to deliver water to irrigators and communities and to service townships. So $120 million is already announced and will be able to be rolled out as this project is developed, and $320 million is what this government has already put on the table.</para>
<para>Could I just make one point. I say to Senator Minchin, as a senator for South Australia—and I have no doubt, because I know Senator Minchin, that, despite the fact I disagree with him on many things, he generally puts his view very clearly—that I think it is incumbent upon him as the Leader of the Opposition in the Senate to be very clear with people in South Australia about precisely what the opposition’s position on this is. What is your position when it comes to the Lower Lakes? Is it as Dr Stone, in her press release on 2 July 2008, said:</para>
<quote>
<para class="block">The Rudd Labor Government and the State Labor Premiers must also come to grips with the reality of the drought: open the barrages to the Lower Lakes, restore that environment ...</para>
</quote>
<para class="block">What this exposes is the way in which those opposite yet again tell one thing to people down the river, downstream, and another thing to communities upstream—playing politics with people’s fears and refusing to address the problem. Senator Minchin, if that is not the opposition’s position, you should get up today in this question time and indicate absolutely that that is not your position.

We are also attempting to deal, over the longer term, with the purchase of water, unlike those opposite, to ensure environmental flows. Again I say: those opposite, as the alternative government, should do better than giving one message to people downstream, in Adelaide, while telling those upstream something different. <inline font-style="italic">(Time expired)</inline>

I draw her attention to the report in today’s <inline font-style="italic">Financial Review</inline> that the minister for resources, Senator Martin Ferguson, is hosting a meeting of some 60 vested interests in this place on Friday so that they can complain about and lobby for their exemptions from a carbon-trading scheme. I ask the minister: will she or the Prime Minister be present at that meeting? Will she release to the Senate the names of the corporate heavies who have been invited? And will she be establishing a meeting of 50 representative Australians, including those from small business, tourism, rural and regional Australia and the public sector so that the wider public interest and the long-term interests of this nation are not lost under the weight of this biggest-end-of-town lobbying arranged by the minister?</para>

<para>—I thank Senator Bob Brown for his question. As the Senate would be aware, we released over the break a green paper which outlined in a fair amount of detail the government’s proposals on the design of the Carbon Pollution Reduction Scheme. It was a comprehensive green paper. The reason we have undertaken this process is to enable consultation across a whole range of sectors of the community, including industry but also other sectors of the community. In case Senator Brown wishes to suggest otherwise, he should be aware that consultations have been held with a whole range of businesses and members of the community at both ministerial level and departmental level. It is the case that this is a whole-of-economy reform. We on this side of the chamber absolutely understand that, for the first time, placing a price on carbon to reflect—</para>

<para>—I will return to the question, Mr President. This is a whole-of-economy reform and there is a whole-of-government response. We are absolutely upfront about the fact that ministers from a range of portfolios will be consulting their sectors about the issues in relation to the Carbon Pollution Reduction Scheme. Senator Carr will be consulting people within his portfolio. I know Minister Albanese is consulting the transport sector. Certainly I have been consulting widely, and Minister Ferguson, as a relevant minister, is also consulting with the sectors with which he deals. That is perfectly normal government business, Senator Brown.</para>

<para>I want to make it very clear that those of us on this side do understand that it requires extensive consultation with business in order to ensure we get the balance right. We also will continue to talk to environmental groups, as I have done, and to other members of the community about this important issue. This is a very substantial economic reform, it is a very substantial environmental reform and it is a complex reform. It is extremely important that we take a methodical approach to considering the options before government. As you know, these are matters on which we have canvassed an extensive amount of detail for the green paper and it is only appropriate that ministers across a range of portfolios consult closely with both business and members of the community about their views on this issue.</para>

I ask the minister, as she left out the minister for the environment, Peter Garrett: will he be consulting 50 key environmental groups from across this nation in this parliament for a day to hear what they have to say on this issue? Will the minister for science be consulting 50 top scientists and might he invite the chief scientist for NASA—who has described the digging up of coal in the future as a criminal offence—to a similar conference in this parliament? Will the minister for small business be having a similar conference to look after the interests of the renewable energy and small business sector, and ditto for tourism?

You left out, for example, the minister for families, who I know has an interest in these issues as well. I have met with environmental groups; I told you that in my primary answer. The reality is that ministers across a range of portfolios will consult as is appropriate on the Carbon Pollution Reduction Scheme.

<para>—I thank Senator Boswell for the question. I am not familiar with the remarks of the New South Wales minister that he refers to. What I can say is that the government’s proposals in regard to this important initiative mean that we as a country are for the first time actually able to prepare ourselves for the inevitability of climate change and to do so in a manner which will actually preserve jobs, provide opportunities for Australians and mean that we are able to meet the challenges that we are confronting head-on.</para>
</talk.start>
<para>Inevitably, there will be cost increases as a result of these changes. But there have equally been measures taken by this government to consult widely, as we have heard from Senator Wong, to ensure that there is a proper consideration of these matters in a timely manner without pretending that we can give some sort of renaissance to the climate change sceptics in a manner which seeks to avoid the inevitability of these issues. What we are dealing with here is a matter of profound importance to this country, to this society and, of course, to this economy. Members of the opposition are unable to meet their responsibilities to the Australian people by fronting up squarely to the energy needs of this country or by dealing with the questions of climate change.</para>
<para>This government has moved rapidly to implement a Carbon Pollution Reduction Scheme from 2010. We will do so on a responsible basis to ensure that the industrial capacity of this country is protected and in such a manner as preserves jobs and ensures that living standards are maintained. The key to the prosperity of this country is ensuring that new investment takes place. We simply cannot pretend that these are problems which will go away and that do not require urgent action by the whole community.</para>

<para>—I have been intrigued by the line of argument being developed by those opposite, because the Rudd government is implementing responsible economic policies to address the economic challenges that we face. We inherited, as I have already said, domestic inflation rates at 16-year highs—this the result of the reckless spending by those opposite—and now global uncertainty and market turmoil are creating considerable uncertainty in the global economy. As IMF managing director Lipsky warned on just Saturday, ‘This turmoil is not going away quickly and will require serious efforts to overcome it.’ That is why the Rudd government brought down a budget with a strong surplus of $22 billion. At a time of global economic uncertainty, and after inheriting inflation at 16-year highs, we need a strong surplus. We need to provide a buffer against uncertain global economic conditions. We need to fight inflation today, to take pressure off the Reserve Bank on monetary policy and to finance critical nation-building investments for the future. Despite these clear economic imperatives, those opposite are intent on opposing key budget measures. Their plans would blow a $6.2 billion hole in the budget surplus. This is the height of economic irresponsibility—vandalising the budget at a time of increased international global uncertainty. No responsible economic manager would choose to increase uncertainty at home when we face significant uncertainties from abroad. No responsible economic manager would choose to vandalise the surplus, making it harder for the Reserve Bank to cut interest rates.</para>
</talk.start>
<para>It has become readily apparent, if it was not already, that the opposition have no understanding of the economic challenges that we face. It has been nine months now, and the opposition’s only economic policy is to irresponsibly blow a $6.2 billion hole in the surplus that Australia needs. We have had an opposition member, Senator Fifield, who has already asked a question on this very matter, on Sky News just yesterday arguing that their budget-blocking policies should simply be absorbed into a lower budget surplus—the ‘magic pudding’. A time of heightened global economic uncertainty is not the time to be vandalising the budget surplus. It is not the time to be putting our economy at risk, including the vital investments in nation-building infrastructure that will guarantee the future economic growth of this country. When the Australian economy was crying out for responsible economic management, the Liberal Party offered irresponsible, knee-jerk, politically motivated spending. That is the legacy of those opposite, from ‘Dr Yes’ to their entire cabinet. They are at fault. <inline font-style="italic">(Time expired)</inline>

<para>—Yes, I am aware of the work that the BCA has done. We have had quite a number of discussions with the Business Council as well as with other industry groups, and that is as it should be. We are very conscious as a government of the importance of striking the right balance when it comes to the Carbon Pollution Reduction Scheme and that is why we are taking a very careful and methodical approach to its design. I do want to make this point, and I hope those opposite at some point get beyond their current confusion on this issue: this is an extremely important issue in terms of preparing this nation for future challenges and it is not an easy policy debate. It certainly requires consideration of a range of factors. Ultimately what government will have to do is to find the right balance, to strike the right balance, in terms of the contribution to reducing emissions and tackling climate change. We need to strike the right balance and we need to ensure that that effort is spread fairly across the economy.</para>
</talk.start>
<para>In February I spoke about the need to ensure that we recognise the competitiveness issues associated with introducing such a scheme for our trade exposed emissions intensive industries, and we have had a significant amount of discussion with business on this issue. We recognise that there are important competitiveness issues which arise from introducing this scheme prior to there being a global carbon price. That is why in the green paper we proposed that 30 per cent of all permits to be issued be given free to emissions intensive trade exposed industries in recognition of their need for support. In addition, the government also outlined in the green paper the intention to establish a Climate Change Action Fund to again assist business to make the transition to a lower carbon economy.</para>
<para>There are obviously a range of views across different sectors of the economy and different industries about the best way to develop and to structure that assistance to the emissions intensive trade exposed industries. We will continue to have a constructive dialogue with business on this issue. I hope down the track we can also have a constructive engagement by the opposition with this issue, an issue which is critical to Australia’s future in terms of both the environmental challenge and also the economic challenge that climate change presents. So we are very conscious as a government of the issues affecting the emissions intensive trade exposed businesses, just as we are also conscious of the need to ensure that the costs of this transition are fairly spread across the economy.</para>
<para>Of course, what Senator Johnston fails to acknowledge in the way he poses the question is that there is no menu of easy options when it comes to tackling climate change. The reality is the more sectors of the economy you shield, the higher the cost, potentially, for the rest of the economy. That is the public policy issue here. We will work very closely with industry to find the best outcome. The whole purpose of putting out the green paper was to enable this sort of detailed consultation. As I said, I have certainly had discussions with the Business Council, as with other business groups, and we will continue to do so as we look to work through the issues which have been put forward.</para>

<para>—I thank Senator Hutchins for his question. He rightly points to what are some troubling developments in the global economic environment and signals that that leads to some uncertainty in terms of people making judgements about what the future holds, which makes it even more important than normal that we have a very certain, controlled and conservative economic management strategy in place to ensure the best outcomes for Australian citizens as these international factors impact on Australia.</para>
</talk.start>
<para>We as a government brought down a very responsible budget in May which sought to provide the tax relief we promised to Australian families but at the same time provide a $22 billion surplus, which created the economic parameters around which people could have certainty that we would be offering strong economic management to keep downward pressure on inflation and keep downward pressure on interest rates. So we delivered on our election commitments to help ease the pressure on families and those on fixed incomes and we sought to ensure that in the broader context we had the measures in place to put downward pressure on interest rates and inflation.</para>
<para>In this new Senate we find that the opposition, dispirited and beaten, decide that their response to the internal fights is to abandon all responsibility, to abandon any claim to being fiscally responsible. Today they have accused the Labor Party of being too fiscally conservative. That is our problem: we are too responsible! They say we ought to spend more. They say us having a huge surplus is an outrage. They think it is economically irresponsible at this time for the Labor Party to provide a large budget surplus. That is how far they have fallen. They actually think a large budget surplus is a bad thing. They actually think we ought to be more risky. Well, we do not agree. We promised that we would deliver responsible economic management and we are delivering it, and the opposition’s response is to say: ‘No, no, no—this isn’t right. We shouldn’t have large budget surpluses. We’ve decided that we shouldn’t do that. We ought to take the risk.’</para>
<para>That is not what this government is going to do. We are not going to respond to that sort of approach. We are going to provide responsible economic management. We are going to try to assist Australian families and those on fixed incomes to fight the scourge of inflation and to fight high interest rates. And we are going to keep the pressure on those economic factors by running a large budget surplus. We would like to see the opposition join us in passing the budget bills that deliver that surplus—not play the role of wreckers but accept their responsibilities, accept that this is the economically responsible thing to do and let the government pass its budget measures, because their economic credibility is on the line. If they continue to behave like this, the Australian public will continue to reject them.</para>
<para>People do not understand why you are in favour of binge drinking. They do not understand why you are opposed to tax on luxury cars. They do not understand why you do not want oil companies to pay appropriate taxation. They just do not understand where you are at. What they want is for the government to be able to pass its budget, to govern responsibly and to put downward pressure on interest rates and inflation. I urge the opposition to join the government and pass the budget bills.</para>

<para>—It is unfortunate that there have been a number of business closures in recent times which have lead to job losses in the Australian manufacturing sector. These job losses are very much regretted. In an open economy such as ours, we are not immune to the pressures of global competition. In such an environment, business continues to restructure and to rationalise to remain competitive.</para>
</talk.start>
<para>The Australian manufacturing sector, I remind the senator opposite, employs 1.1 million Australians. Over the past 12 months some 22,300 new jobs have been created in the manufacturing sector. The value of the manufacturing sector in 2007 was at a record level of $103 billion in real terms, representing some 10.05 per cent of GDP. Manufacturing exports remain strong and have increased by an average annual rate of five per cent over recent years and, in 2007, increased by 7.2 per cent to a record of $87.1 billion.</para>
<para>The government has in place a range of measures to assist affected workers find alternative employment. For example, Job Search Support provides jobseekers with practical job search assistance, including advice on job search techniques and placing their resume on Job Search, one of Australia’s largest job networks. It is also about creating opportunities for new business to open, and this has occurred in such areas as food and beverage, renewable energy and IT. The Australian manufacturing industry has a positive future.</para>
<para>I recognise that Australian manufacturing is facing increasing costs as a result of higher interest rates and a strong dollar, but the government is working to turn that around. This is a government that is focused on managing the economy to ensure that the operating environment is conducive to the long-term viability of the Australian manufacturing sector. Lowering inflation is critical to that objective.</para>
<para>We saw in the previous government’s term essentially a policy of ‘set and forget’ being the order of the day. This government, however, has taken an entirely different view. We have established a series of reviews which will be instrumental in guiding innovation and manufacturing industry policy. In this regard, the government is optimistic that the future of manufacturing sectors such as the automotive industry will be bright if the right investment decisions are made now. I look forward to hearing something positive from the opposition with regard to the importance of the Australian automotive industry.</para>

<para>—What I did indicate to the shadow minister was that the manufacturing sector continues to be a significant employer in Australia. The sector employs well over 1.1 million Australians, largely in high-wage, high-skilled jobs, largely in quality jobs, largely in full-time jobs, which stands in stark contrast to the attitude of the previous government, which sought to drive down wages, sought to drive down job security and, through its Work Choices legislation, sought to undermine the confidence of working people and their capacity to actually put themselves forward in terms of the future prosperity of this country.</para>

<motion>
<para>That the Senate take note of the answers given by the Minister for Broadband, Communications and the Digital Economy (Senator Conroy) to questions without notice asked by Senators Coonan, Fifield and Sterle today relating to inflation.</para>
</motion>
<para class="block">I wish to take note of the answers—or should I say ‘non-answers’—given by Senator Conroy today. I am very pleased to see that Senator Conroy has gone scuttling out of the chamber because today we have seen the most pitiful display by the senator purporting to represent the Treasurer. He was incapable of answering straightforward economic questions; namely, he could not explain how his government’s higher taxes will not put up prices. He totally avoided the question. Even though he represents the Treasurer in the Senate, he did not even know the projected surplus over the forward estimates. You can always tell a senator on the other side of the chamber is having trouble answering a question when the best they can do is resort to false and tired rhetoric about the coalition.</para>
<para>We are here looking at what the government is doing. The key test the government set itself in the budget was whether it would strengthen the economy and whether it would put maximum downward pressure on inflation and interest rates. Regrettably, it has failed miserably on both accounts. The Treasurer, Mr Swan, and Senator Conroy have comprehensively failed to explain how increasing taxes on alcopops, gas and cars will somehow reduce inflation. The Treasurer is directly increasing the taxes on cars, alcohol and gas, and by increasing taxes on those goods the prices will go up.</para>
<para>The budget papers also very clearly show that the government expects people to drop out of private health insurance, which will put upward pressure on premiums. Families want to know how increasing the price of these goods and services reduces inflation. Families must be scratching their heads at this. Labor have not lifted a single finger since they have come into government to help those battling with the rising costs of living—with petrol, with groceries, with private health insurance and with home interest rates. Instead, we have these nonsensical policies of watching things go up: watching petrol prices go up, watching grocery prices, watching people leave private health insurance and watching people battle with increased interest rates.</para>
<para>It is a matter of record and it is indisputable—no matter how much those on the other side would like to have it differently—that the former coalition government left the economy in the best shape it has ever been in with real wages increasing by more than 20 per cent, real GDP per capita growing by 32 per cent, unemployment halved, inflation kept at 2.5 per cent on average over the cycle and Labor’s infamous $96 billion debt eliminated so that there was no net debt. Since Labor came to office, increasingly and worryingly there have been signs that they have no plan to strengthen the economy and put downward pressure on inflation. This is affecting business confidence and consumer confidence, which are at the lowest levels we have seen in something like 30 years. Business confidence has plummeted because there is no certainty about Labor’s direction for this economy, apart from the fact that it is slowing. The economy is starting to flag under the Labor government and the signs are they simply have no idea how to handle it and what they are going to do. Labor are wedded to the old ways of managing the economy. We have seen writ large higher spending, higher taxes and higher unemployment, which will all contribute to lower economic growth.</para>
<para>The coalition believes there should be no increase in taxes in a flagging economy where there is a bulging surplus. Labor on the other hand are poor economic managers. It is Australian families who will be paying for Labor’s mismanagement. What hope is there for families struggling with higher prices when the government’s only strategy is to increase taxes? We will continue to hold Labor accountable. We will not be a party to the passage of tax increases that hurt Australian families, put up prices and increase inflation. During the election campaign Labor never mentioned that they would increase taxes. Labor never mentioned that they would raise taxes to build a large slush fund to be used by them before the next election. They offer us nothing but policies like Fuelwatch, a policy so bad their own departments condemned it. <inline font-style="italic">(Time expired)</inline>

<para>—It is almost painful to see the opposition desperately seeking a way to justify their irresponsible decisions to oppose the government’s budget measures. Who knows why they are doing this. Obviously, there are leadership tensions, faction tensions within the party and tensions between the Liberal and the National parties within the coalition. Nobody wants to say no to anyone else. Nobody in the Liberal Party is prepared to take leadership and say that the government should be permitted to pass its budget—a budget that is designed to put downward pressure on inflation.</para>
</talk.start>
<para>This is sheer short-term opportunistic behaviour and the kind of knee-jerk reaction that we saw over and over again from the coalition parties in government. It is that same old pattern of behaviour when dealing with crises. They go around them and do not deal with them head-on and with long-term responsible economic management. What did we inherit from that kind of behaviour by the Liberal Party when they were in power? The highest inflation in 16 years, 10 interest rate rises in five years and decreased productivity. That is the kind of short-term, opportunistic government that left this government in the situation where we have to have a tight, tough budget to have a surplus that will put downward pressure on inflation.</para>
<para>Now we have the situation where, because they cannot deal with the pressures within their party, because they cannot compete with competing factions, competing Treasurers and competing leaders, they have agreed to oppose budget measures that will put additional taxes on luxury cars and on alcopops.

It is the gas companies that will have the incentive for gas exploration and development removed.

<para>—I should not admit this but I am actually becoming a little misty-eyed today. I am feeling a little bit wistful because I have been reminiscing during question time about a time in our recent history when banks respected and maybe even feared the Treasurer, when the Treasurer of the day did more than watch and when the Treasurer used to speak about economic fundamentals rather than genies and bottles. It was a time when Australia was called the ‘miracle economy’ and the ‘wonder down under’ and a time when a series like <inline font-style="italic">The Hollowmen</inline> would have been considered satire rather than a documentary. I think fondly back to those days.</para>
</talk.start>
<para>In the nine months that this government has been in power things have changed. This government has transformed the Australian economy into one which is slowing and where unemployment is forecast to increase, according to the government’s own budget forecast, by 150-odd thousand. The Reserve Bank of Australia have also predicted a further 100,000 on top of that. Inflation is rising, confidence is at record lows and the economy is on the verge of a swan dive.</para>
<para>Senator Conroy must have been watching too many episodes of <inline font-style="italic">The Hollowmen</inline> because he tried a bit of satire today. He spoke about punching holes in budget surpluses and black holes. I have to say that the concept of a black hole has certainly changed from my recent experience. Black holes certainly are not what they used to be. I well remember that in 1996 the Labor government left the nation a $10 billion budget deficit. A deficit is a black hole. I well remember Labor leaving us, the nation, $96 billion in Commonwealth government debt. Debt is a black hole. How much help did we get from the Labor Party? None. If you listen to Labor’s view of what a responsible opposition should do, what a responsible Senate should do, you could be forgiven for thinking that Labor in opposition created some sort of Senate nirvana for the coalition government. It was anything but. Labor opposed each and every savings measure we presented to this parliament to repair the budget and to pay down Labor’s debt. But we balanced the budget. We repaid every cent of Labor debt despite that opposition and, at the election, we passed to Labor a government with an asset position, a government that was debt free, a government that was in surplus. Also, we left Labor with record low unemployment and a strongly growing economy.</para>
<para>Clearly that is not a crisis—you would be grateful to inherit that sort of economy—so Labor had to manufacture a crisis. Labor turned an inflation challenge into a crisis. Wayne Swan talked down the economy, talked up inflation and egged on the Reserve Bank to increase interest rates, which is exactly what they did. Having created this sense of crisis, Labor hold out their budget as the only economic hope for the nation. There are a few points to bear about Labor’s budget. On a no-policy-change basis from the previous government, the budget would be in surplus in the order of magnitude of about what Labor have.</para>
<para>Labor’s budget is not built on savings; it is built on new taxes. And Labor have done something that we have not seen before. They are counting revenue—tax—as a saving. This budget is not based on savings; it is based on new taxes. And these taxes were not flagged before the election. Labor cannot claim any sort of mandate theory here. Worse than that, these taxes are inflationary. They are not needed because we left the budget in a strong position in surplus. They were not flagged, they are not needed and they are inflationary.</para>
<para>We have a pretty simple approach to budget matters. Once you have provided for schools, hospitals, defence and security and paid down debt, if you have money left over you should return it because, if you have money left over after providing for services and paying down debt, it means that you are taxing too much. Rather than doing that, this government is increasing taxes. They should be condemned. These taxes were not flagged and they should be opposed.</para>

<para>—I am sorry, Mr Deputy President. I note that Senator Hogg would not have let me get away with that either. Let us look at some of the examples. Let us look at the figures for people employed. If we are going to talk about an economy which they say is slowing, let us look at some of the statistics. In December 2007 there were 10,607,100 people employed. The latest figures that we have available from the Australian Bureau of Statistics show that in July 2008 10,721,500 were employed—a substantial increase in employed persons. That is not the sign of a slowing economy.</para>
</talk.start>
</continue>
<para>The average weekly time earnings in the December quarter 2007 was $1,111. In the June quarter of 2008 it was $1,131.40. Those figures are taken from the ABS statistics. The seasonally adjusted unemployment rate for November 2007, when we were elected to government, was 4.5 per cent. In July 2008 it was 4.3 per cent. The long-term unemployment rate in November 2007 was 14.1 per cent. In July 2008 it was 13.7 per cent. The number of long-term unemployed persons in November 2007 was 70,300. In July 2008 it was 68,200—tracking down.</para>
<para>Senator Fifield wants to get up and mislead the Senate with this general spin that they learnt when in government, when they did not have to do anything of substance but just spun the line that they were great economic managers. What they did was take their foot off the accelerator; they took their eye off the ball—and we can use a million sporting analogies as we have just been through the Olympics; they could be endless. What they did was forget to manage the economy. They started to believe their own rhetoric and spin. Even though they had been warned by the Reserve Bank, they left us with record high inflation. We have to address that, and so it was a tough budget.</para>
<para>But let us not forget that that budget also delivered $46.7 billion in tax cuts to working families. Senator Fifield comes in here and says that we give nothing back and it is just about some tax grabs—which are in a number of very small areas and are really about tax equalisation and some adjustments, and if I have time I will get into some of the detail of that—but there were $46.7 billion in tax cuts to working Australians. Do not come in here and tell us that it is all about a tax grab. Nothing could be further from the truth.</para>
<para>This government has built a strong budget surplus of $22 billion to help put downward pressure on interest rates. And what is happening? It has been flagged by the RBA that interest rates should start to drop. We cannot wait for the day that we will reap the benefits of our tough budget and our $22 billion surplus. We are responsible economic managers and are starting to put that downward pressure on interest rates. <inline font-style="italic">(Time expired)</inline>

<para>—I am glad you are, because there are some things that I have to say that might help Senator Marshall understand a little bit better what has been going on in the Australian economy over the last nine months. I was very interested to hear some comments that were made by Senator Hurley. She is a senator whom I have a lot of respect for. I am with her on the economics committee, and she is a very sensible and capable woman. However, over the last six or seven weeks I have been travelling with her and hearing evidence from all over the country about many of the budget measures that we are discussing today. I could see her constantly cringing as the overwhelming evidence that was presented quite clearly proved that the government’s budget measures were not the way to be going. I almost felt sorry for her as she tried to defend the government’s position on condensate, Fuelwatch, the luxury car tax, the Medicare levy and so on. But despite that, she came in here today and tried once again to valiantly defend the government’s position.</para>
</talk.start>
</continue>
<para>Senator Marshall tried to talk the economy up, and I will have more to say on that in a minute. But even Treasury, in their government budget papers, noted a prediction that 185,000 job losses would result from the budget measures. The reality is that big companies are already shedding jobs. You just have to look at the major announcements that have been made in the last couple of months by Ford, and by Cadbury which is in my own state. The list goes on.</para>
<para>By any measure, the Rudd Labor government inherited a strong, resilient and flexible economy. The Australian economy remains robust and resilient but it is showing clear signs of weakening since Mr Rudd took office. I heard an analogy which I think was quite appropriate. You think of a very well-maintained, modern plane which is flying along and then you hit a rough patch in the air. In the past, when we have had the rough patches in this well-maintained plane, we have had some very experienced pilots up the front who actually took us through and you had a sense of confidence as you went forward. But now we have the inexperienced pilots straight out of flight school up the front and although we have a nice, solid, resilient plane we have these inexperienced people at the front as we go through this rough patch. It worries me where we are heading. You just have to have a look at what has happened already in nine months to see that we really are facing some problems.</para>
<para>The S&amp;P 200 index for the Australian stock market has fallen from 6,330.2 to 4,981.1, a fall of 21.3 per cent compared with a fall of only 12.6 per cent on the US S&amp;P 500. So we are doing worse than they are in the US, contrary to what most people would think. The Reserve Bank has increased official interest rates by 0.5 percentage points since the Rudd government came in. Under the Rudd government mortgage interest rates have risen to levels not seen since Labor was last in office. Small business overdraft rates, now at around 12 per cent, are at levels not seen since 1992. They have increased 1.15 percentage points since the election. Inflation has increased to 4.5 per cent, a rate not seen since the last Labor government, if your exclude the one-off GST effect.</para>
<para>The Melbourne Institute’s most recent survey results show that consumer inflationary expectations are high with the median expected inflation rate at 4.9 per cent. They are expecting it to go up even further. The proportion of survey respondents expecting annual inflation to fall within the Reserve Bank’s target band of two to three per cent is only 8.8 per cent, which is lower than the average over the last year of 12 per cent. During the coalition’s term in office median inflationary expectations averaged 3.1 per cent, which was the best average performance of any government since the survey began. In contrast, since the Rudd government has taken office, median inflationary expectations have averaged 4.9 per cent. That is the highest nine-month average since 1991 when Labor was last in office.</para>
<para>The Reserve Bank also conducts a survey of inflationary expectations and publishes the results in its Statement on Monetary Policy. The RBA’s data shows that, between August and November 2007, expectations among market economists of 2008-09 inflation actually fell. Market economists expected inflation to be going down late last year yet union officials expected inflation to remain steady. Since Mr Swan started talking up inflation back at the beginning of February, expectations of inflation among market economists have increased in every RBA survey. <inline font-style="italic">(Time expired)</inline>

<para>—I congratulate you, Mr Deputy President, on your election. I move:</para>
</talk.start>
<motion>
<para>That the Senate take note of an answer given by the Minister for Climate Change and Water (Senator Wong) to a question without notice asked by the Leader of the Australian Greens (Senator Bob Brown) today relating to an emissions trading scheme.</para>
</motion>
<para class="block">I would like to start by saying that it is quite obvious that Mr Ferguson, the Minister for Resources and Energy, is undermining Minister Wong at a fast rate. I am surprised that, with the attack on her, she is not in here actually holding her own position. It is very clear that the Minister for Resources and Energy, Martin Ferguson, is out to undermine the emissions trading scheme and the integrity of that scheme. The fact that his department has circulated to business a proposal which is supposedly more industry friendly than the green paper is a split in this government and they need to come clean on it straightaway. We would like to see immediately Minister Ferguson’s proposal that he has circulated to these businesses which are coming to Canberra for what the minister is describing as a ‘crisis meeting’.</para>
<para>Nobody is in crisis except those industries who have known the problem of climate change and who have done everything in their power to support the former Howard government doing nothing on climate change. They have been on every delegation to UNFCCC meetings undermining any potential for a global agreement. Now they are in Canberra with Minister Ferguson and will be doing their level best on Friday to undermine even the position that the government has taken. Minister Wong was careful not to say whether or not she had been invited to Minister Ferguson’s meeting. It is very clear from her answer that she was not. Was she even consulted when Minister Ferguson rushed out to these 50 big polluters and set up a so-called crisis meeting? They are here to do the biggest theatrical performance of the rent seekers you could ever wish to see. That is what will be happening in Canberra on Friday. And what is the aim of it? The aim of it is to try and bring pressure to bear. They want more money for their so-called clean coal and so-called carbon capture and storage. They already have a minister out there saying that the long-term liability should be carried by the community and the taxpayers and now, not content with that, here they are lining up because they want more free permits and a more friendly proposal in terms of compensation that they might get from permit sales.</para>
<para>I think it is extraordinary that nobody is picking up on the fact that the Minister for Climate Change and Water is being actively undermined by the Minister for Resources and Energy in her own government, and he would not be doing it without the Prime Minister’s wink-wink, nod-nod. We know this Prime Minister is a control freak. We know that he is looking over the shoulder of every single one of his ministers. He knows exactly what they are doing. While we have Minister Wong running around with her green paper consultations, we have Minister Ferguson out there inviting the key polluters to Canberra to enable them to put more pressure on to make the rest of the community pay so that they get off as scot-free as they possibly can. These are the people who have prevented action in the past. These are the very same companies that refused, for example, to implement the energy efficiency opportunities that they have been required to identify under the legislation. They were the people who lobbied to say, ‘No, we should not be forced to implement those opportunities. We should just know about them and decide ourselves.’ And deciding not to implement the energy efficiency opportunities when they could have done so, they now come with their hands out to get compensated, which is even more against the public interest. I have a real concern about what is going on with this government.</para>
<para>The second thing is that, in consultation, we had Minister Ferguson inviting 50 business leaders of the major polluters to Canberra to have their whinge for 10 minutes about what is wrong with the emissions trading system and put forward their solutions, which—surprise, surprise—are, ‘Give us more money, give us more free permits, slow it down, have a low cap and try and take it out.’ But where is the roundtable for the 50 environmentalists, the 50 scientists, to have a crisis meeting to say how bad climate change is and how it is getting worse?</para>
<para>Just this week we have had reports that a 160-square-kilometre piece of the Greenland ice shelf is just hanging on. We have every scientist out there saying that things are worse. Last week we had Professor Will Steffen saying that we are probably looking at a four-metre sea level rise this century. Where is Minister Wong’s climate crisis meeting for the environment movement? Where is her crisis meeting for the scientists? Why do we have the government bringing here those who wish to destroy the planet in terms of climate change and not take any action on their emissions and not having the other side of the argument? I do not know of 50 environment groups that have been consulted. <inline font-style="italic">(Time expired)</inline>

<motion>
<para>That the Senate records its deep regret at the death of Signaller Sean Patrick McCarthy on 8 July 2008 while on combat operations in Afghanistan and places on record its appreciation of his service to his country and tenders its profound sympathy to his family in their bereavement.</para>
</motion>
<para class="block">On behalf of all government senators, and I am sure on behalf of all senators, I wish to express my heartfelt condolences to Signaller McCarthy’s mother and father, Mary and David, and to his sisters, Leigh and Clare, and to express our sympathy to his whole extended family and friends including, of course, his fellow service men and women.</para>
<para>Signaller McCarthy was a patriotic Australian, an outstanding soldier and a valued member of the Special Air Service Regiment and the Royal Australian Corps of Signals. The Special Air Service Regiment, as we all know, has a long tradition of exceptional service to the defence of Australia, and Signaller McCarthy was the embodiment of the courage, professionalism and endurance that are hallmarks of this elite unit. He displayed great strength, determination and courage while serving in the challenging environments of East Timor and Afghanistan.</para>
<para>Unfortunately Signaller McCarthy lost his life serving his country and is owed a special debt of gratitude that can never be fully repaid. Members of parliament, and I think members of both the previous government and this government, understand the huge responsibility of asking our service personnel to serve their country in war zones, and we all feel very deeply the cost that our service men and women sometimes pay in carrying out those duties. I think it always a useful reminder to us all of the responsibilities we have in terms of trying to ensure that they are not put in harms way but that when they are we provide them with the best support we can.</para>
<para>Signaller McCarthy served his country admirably in a number of zones. His work with his comrades in spreading security in Oruzgan province is noble and enduring. Through his work the Taliban were weakened, the reach of the Afghan government was extended and the environment in which our troops undertake vital reconstruction work was made secure. His comrades continue that vital work. They continue to honour his memory and to honour his commitment to the task.</para>
<para>Signaller McCarthy’s sacrifice will not be forgotten. On behalf of the Australian government, we offer our prayers and our support to Signaller McCarthy’s family and friends and thank them for his sacrifice and service to his nation.</para>

<para>—I rise on behalf of the coalition to strongly support the motion moved by Senator Evans, and I endorse all the remarks made by Senator Evans in support of this very important motion. It is critical that the Senate does unanimously express its deep regret and profound sorrow at the death of Signaller Sean McCarthy on 8 July. He was someone who was on his second tour of duty in Afghanistan, and of course all our best wishes and thoughts are with his family and friends.</para>
</talk.start>
<para>It does remind us of the extreme danger which Australian personnel face in Afghanistan, but it is also a reminder of the importance of that struggle, and I think his family and friends should take comfort from the fact that there is in this country bipartisan support for our engagement in Afghanistan and that Sean McCarthy died for a noble cause—the cause of containing terrorism and of trying to bring peace and stability to the nation of Afghanistan to enable the people of Afghanistan to live in peace and security. It is an important cause, and we should all renew our commitment to that cause. It is with profound regret and sadness that we record our sorrow at the death of Sean McCarthy.</para>

<para>That the Senate records its deep regret at the death, on 10 July 2008, of Donald Michael Devitt, former senator for Tasmania, and places on record its appreciation of his long and meritorious public service and tenders its profound sympathy to his family in their bereavement.</para>
</motion>
<para class="block">Donald Devitt was born in 1921, at Launceston, Tasmania, and went to Smithton District High School. He grew up on the north-west coast of Tasmania, the same area in which Senator Nick Sherry and the member for Lyons, Dick Adams, grew up. Don was a good friend of Senator Sherry’s father, Ray.</para>
<para>Don served in both the Army and the RAAF during World War II. He enlisted in the AMF in 1942 and transferred to the 2nd AIF seven months later. In 1944 he enlisted in the RAAF, where he served for just under a year. Don also joined the Citizen Military Force from 1951 to 1952.</para>
<para>He spent many years working as a council clerk in Tasmania. During this period Don was a member of the Council Clerk Municipality of Queenstown, Scottsdale and Beaconsfield. He was also an associate of the Institute of Municipal Administration and a member of the state executive of the Council Clerks Association of Tasmania. From 1956 until 1964, Don worked as a farmer.</para>
<para>Don joined the ALP in 1955. He served as president and secretary of his local branch and was also a member of the state and federal executive in 1969. Don was a well-known figure in the Tasmanian ALP. I am told that he loved to sing and play the guitar. He apparently entertained many after-dinner get-togethers at ALP conferences.</para>
<para>Don was elected as a Labor senator for Tasmania at the 1964 election. Don was known as a hard-working senator and during his 14 years here he served on many parliamentary committees. These included the Senate Standing Committee on Regulations and Ordinances, from 1967 to 1976; a legislative and general purpose committee, the Senate Finance and Government Operations Committee, from 1971 to 1975; the Foreign Affairs and Defence Committee, from 1973 to 1975; the Constitutional and Legal Affairs Committee from 1976 to 1978; and the Joint Committee on the Australian Capital Territory from 1967 to 1975. Don also participated in many parliamentary delegations including the parliamentary delegations to Anzac Day celebrations in Papua New Guinea in 1966 and 1969, and the parliamentary delegation to the USSR, Sweden and Denmark in 1973.</para>
<para>Don had a strong interest in Tasmanian shipping and the Antarctic. In the summer of 1976-77, he had the distinction of being the first senator in the history of the Commonwealth to visit Macquarie base and Mawson’s Hut in Antarctica.</para>
<para>After his retirement in 1978, Don remained very active in the Tasmanian ALP and was very supportive and encouraging of up-and-coming candidates. He and his wife, Dorothy, were members of the Devonport branch, and Don remained a member until his death. He is remembered with enormous affection, in particular by those in the party who knew him.</para>
<para>In his retirement, Don also immersed himself in lapidary. He had a workshop at home and would participate in gemstone associations. Don also loved sailing and did a lot of sailing out of Devonport.</para>
<para>Don passed away on 10 July this year on the eve of his 87th birthday. His funeral was held on 16 July. On behalf of the government I offer our condolences to his wife, Dorothy, and their children and grandchildren.</para>

<para>—On behalf of the coalition I am pleased to have the opportunity to offer our sincere condolences to the family of former senator Donald Devitt. As Senator Conroy mentioned, Don commenced in the Senate as a representative for the Labor Party from Tasmania. I think it is worth noting that one of the great things about our Constitution and the make-up of this chamber is that a state like Tasmania has equal representation with all the other states, which enables people like Don Devitt to have the opportunity to serve in this place.</para>
</talk.start>
<para>It is recorded that he was a quiet but very conscientious senator. He came here with much administrative experience in local government in Tasmania, and I think that is a good background for service in this chamber. As I understand it, he was passionate about local government and, in his first speech, highlighted his concerns about the financial support for that level of government, which no doubt is an ongoing and perennial issue, but one that we must all be conscious of.</para>
<para>As someone who also served on the Senate Regulations and Ordinances Committee, I think it is also worth nothing Don’s long service as a member of that committee, which, I think, is one of the most important and perhaps undervalued committees that we have in this place. He was a member of the committee from 1967 to 1976 and he chaired it from 1973 to 1975. He was a long-serving member of the very important Joint Committee on the Australian Capital Territory and a member of the Joint Select Committee on the New and Permanent Parliament House, from 1967 to 1969, but those of us who have our doubts about this place should not blame him. I also understand that in 1976-77 he became the first senator ever to visit Macquarie base and Mawson’s Hut in Antarctica, which was a great achievement.</para>
<para>He was of course also in the Senate during the three extraordinarily turbulent years leading up to the dismissal of the Whitlam government, and thus was one of those privileged or otherwise to be part of the most controversial and dramatic period in Australian political history, and one I am sure we will never see repeated. Therefore he witnessed the tumultuous changes of government that occurred in 1972 and 1975 from the perspective of the Senate.</para>
<para>I am advised he remained active in the Labor Party after his retirement and was very well respected in his home state of Tasmania. I think it is worthy for former senators to continue to serve their parties after their service in this chamber. To Don’s wife, Dorothy, and his children, we the coalition place on record our appreciation of his public service and we tender our profound sympathy to the family in their bereavement.</para>

<para>That the Senate records its deep regret at the death, on 13 July 2008, of the Honourable Peter Drew Durack, former senator for Western Australia, and places on record its appreciation of his long and meritorious public service and tenders its profound sympathy to his family in their bereavement.</para>
</motion>
<para class="block">Peter Durack was one of Western Australia’s longest serving senators, retiring from the Commonwealth parliament after 22 years in federal politics and a political career that spanned almost three decades. He was highly respected across the political divide and was known as a kind, mild-mannered man of great integrity who made a remarkable contribution to law reform in this country.</para>
<para>Peter was born in Perth in 1926 into one of Western Australia’s pioneering families, the Duracks. He was educated at Christian Brothers College and Aquinas College in Perth and went on to study law at the University of Western Australia. It was during his time at UWA that Peter first became politically active. Peter was very quick to nail his political colours to the mast. In 1944, at the age of 18, Peter co-founded the UWA Liberal Club, just a few months after Sir Robert Menzies established the Liberal Party. Widely acknowledged as a great debater and a brilliant student, Peter was awarded the 1949 Rhodes Scholarship for Western Australia and completed a Bachelor of Civil Law degree at Oxford. After graduating he practised law in London and then continued working as a lawyer upon his return to Perth. He had a highly successful legal career which culminated in his appointment as QC in 1978. However, by then his career as a lawyer had already given way to his passion for politics. Peter was elected to the Western Australian Legislative Assembly in 1965 as the Liberal member for the seat of Perth in the WA Legislative Assembly. He served in state parliament only until 1968, which is when he was elected President of the Western Australian Liberal Party, a position he held until he entered the Senate in 1971.</para>
<para>Peter’s early years in the Senate coincided with the period of the Whitlam Labor government. Peter was part of the block of coalition senators that caused the Whitlam government so much agony and eventually he formed part of the new Fraser government that came to power in the wake of the 1975 dismissal. After just four years in the Senate, Peter was appointed to the ministry of the new Fraser government. He was initially made Minister for Repatriation in 1976, which was renamed Veterans’ Affairs three months later. Peter served in this position for another year until Bob Ellicott resigned as Attorney-General in 1977. He held that position until the election of the Hawke Labor government in 1983.</para>
<para>As Attorney-General, Peter Durack steered one of the most significant periods of law reform in Australian history, particularly in the area of human rights and civil rights. His best known achievement was the introduction of the Commonwealth freedom of information legislation in 1981, which for the first time gave Australians legally enforceable rights to access information held by government. The legislation represented a significant expansion of civil liberties for Australians.</para>
<para>As well as being heralded as the father of FOI, as Attorney-General, Peter was involved in preparing the two-airline agreement and the broadcasting and television legislation. He brought changes to copyright law, administrative appeals and the powers of Federal Police and ASIO and he was involved in the settlement with the states on offshore sovereignty. He worked on the Acts Interpretation Act aimed at instructing the judiciary to take into account the purpose of legislation when interpreting it, and played an important role in the ending of appeals to the Privy Council. Peter also oversaw the appointment to the High Court of Sir Ronald Wilson, former Governor-General Sir William Deane, and Sir Gerard Brennan, who went on to become Chief Justice.</para>
<para>During his time as a senator Peter also served as Deputy Leader of the Government in the Senate from 1978 to 1983 and as Deputy Leader of the Opposition in the Senate from 1983 to 1987 and again from 1990 to 1992. He was also a member of a long list of parliamentary committees which included Regulations and Ordinances, Publications, Scrutiny of Bills, Privileges, Constitutional and Legal Affairs, Industry and Trade, National Resources, Finance and Public Administration, Securities and Exchange, Civil Rights of Migrant Australians, and Foreign Ownership and Control. Peter retired from the Senate in 1993, but he continued to play an important role in mentoring the next generation of Liberal politicians.</para>
<para>Peter passed away on 13 July this year. He leaves a long legacy of public service. In tributes to Peter Durack from former political colleagues he has been remembered for his central role in one of the most constructive periods of law reform and human rights protections in Australian history. On behalf of the government I offer condolences to his family, in particular his wife, Isabel, their children, Anne and Philip, and their grandchildren.</para>

<para>—On behalf of the coalition, I join with Senator Conroy and the government in extending our sincere sympathies to the family of Peter Durack upon his death on 30 July at the age of 81. Regrettably, I did not have the opportunity to actually serve with Peter in this place—his term ceased on 30 June 1993 and mine started on 1 July that year—but I certainly knew Peter personally and held him in extraordinarily high regard. He was one of the most accomplished senators the Liberal Party has produced and I think was held in the utmost respect right across the political divide. His contribution to Australian politics and the Senate are significant, are valued and should be honoured today.</para>
</talk.start>
<para>He made a very big contribution, as Senator Conroy has noted, to the Liberal Party in his home state of Western Australia and was a member of one of the most significant and well-known families in that state. He co-founded the University of Western Australia Liberal Club while studying law in the middle of 1945, stemming from his strong and understandable admiration for Robert Menzies. He contested and won the seat of Perth in the WA Legislative Assembly in 1965 and held that seat until 1968, when he became President of the Liberal Party in Western Australia until entering this place in 1971. So he is one of those few Australians who have served at both state and federal parliamentary levels. He was, as Senator Conroy noted, a very successful barrister and was appointed Queen’s Counsel in 1978. He did make a huge contribution to the Liberal Party in Western Australia, both in his service to the organisation and as a mentor to party members in that state, and to Liberal parliamentarians right across the country. Indeed, I knew him in my capacity as an official of the party’s federal secretariat and knew well of his mentoring role.</para>
<para>As has been noted, he entered the Senate in July 1971, having been elected in 1970 at one of those very rare things, a separate half-Senate election. He was to become one of the most outstanding Western Australian Liberal senators, serving for the lengthy period of 22 years in this place. He held numerous frontbench positions for our party, in both government and opposition, and was one of the most senior figures for much of his time in the Senate. He saw the change of government in 1975 and then, of course, opposition in 1983. But in both opposition and government he was a very senior figure. He was a member of the opposition shadow ministry from only three years after he came here, in 1974, until we came into government in 1975. He served as Deputy Leader of the Government in the Senate from 1978 to 1983, as deputy to the great John Carrick. Then after the defeat of the Fraser government he continued as deputy leader—in this case in opposition—from 1983 to 1987, under the great leadership of Fred Chaney, his colleague from Western Australia: a rare double act from the state of Western Australia. Then, with an interregnum, he again became the deputy leader, from 1990 to 1992, under the leadership of then Senator Robert Hill.</para>
<para>I certainly remember well the occasion on which, after the 1990 election, it was widely expected that Peter Durack would become the Leader of the Opposition in the Senate. But, to everyone’s surprise, my South Australian friend and colleague Robert Hill won that leadership, and Peter was elected the deputy. Fred Chaney, his friend and colleague from Western Australia, has described Peter as having ‘a wonderful combination of a great depth of legal knowledge with a terrific understanding of the political system’.</para>
<para>Peter Durack was a Senate man: he really understood and respected the role of this place. In particular, having entered the Senate when the committee system was in its infancy, he was a strong advocate of the importance of estimates committees and the very thorough examination by this place of government legislation. He did have many achievements in the Senate as a minister. He held, in all, four ministerial positions in the Fraser government. But, as Senator Conroy has noted, he is most particularly remembered for his service for six years, no less, as Attorney-General from 1977 until our defeat in 1983. He will be remembered, I think, as one of the most accomplished Attorneys-General and the most significant in our nation’s history, particularly, as Senator Conroy has noted, for his record and his historic act of introducing the Freedom of Information Act in 1981. Former Prime Minister John Howard has said of Peter Durack, his former cabinet colleague in the Fraser government, that he was ‘a terrifically thoughtful contributor’ in cabinet meetings and in shadow cabinet meetings. Anyone who knew Peter would understand exactly what former Prime Minister John Howard meant when he said that.</para>
<para>Peter’s contribution to parliament and public life was significant. All those who encountered him in the chamber speak of his strong intellect and his great integrity. He was indeed a great asset to the Senate and to the Liberal Party in Western Australia. I am pleased to extend to his wife, Isabel, and their children, Anne and Philip, and their families, our great appreciation of his long and meritorious public service. We tender our sympathy to the family in their bereavement.</para>

<para>—With the death of former senator Peter Durack, the Liberal Party in Western Australia has lost one of its most influential parliamentarians. Peter Durack was an outstanding Western Australian senator whose 23 years of dedicated service included more than six years as Attorney-General and almost a decade as a senior opposition figure. For those of us from Western Australia, that carries with it an enormous amount of commitment not just to the parliament but to the party in Western Australia.</para>
</talk.start>
<para>Peter Durack was a brilliant student. He was a Rhodes scholar in 1949. He completed a Bachelor of Civil Law at Oxford University before practising in London. Peter Durack participated in many national debates during his time in the Senate and since his retirement from parliament. I should pause to say that his contribution to our party in Western Australia was enormous, beyond the days of his service in this place. He is one of the few parliamentarians to have also held the state seat of Perth—from 1965 to 1968. He was state president of the Liberal Party in Western Australia from 1968 to 1971. He was one of Australia’s longest serving senators, as I have said, with more than 22 years to his credit. He was shadow minister for defence from 1990 to 1992 as well as shadow minister for resources and energy—a job that I am reasonably familiar with—between 1984 and 1987.</para>
<para>Peter Durack will be remembered as one of Australia’s most accomplished attorneys-general. He was a reformist. One of his first tasks as Attorney-General was to support the freedom of information bill. It was a new concept then, one that has evolved and developed but which commenced under his stewardship. When enacted, it gave a legal enforceable right for Australians to access information held by government, a concept which we all very much take for granted to a great extent today. That legislation was one of the biggest changes to civil liberties and was a foundation stone of civil liberties in this country.</para>
<para>Peter Durack mentored a generation, me included, of Liberal parliamentarians throughout Australia and was widely regarded as a person of great integrity and intellect. I can certainly affirm that. Peter Durack is survived by his wife, Isabel, who is a historian, their two children, Anne and Philip, who are both lawyers, and four grandchildren. His wise counsel, I must say, will be greatly missed, but his positive influence over the Liberal Party and this parliament will survive.</para>

<para>—My congratulations to you, Mr President, on your election. I guess that little more can be said about Peter Durack than has already been said by the previous speakers, all of whom have gone through his very long and distinguished record. I just wanted to associate myself with the condolence motion for the late Peter Durack on the basis that I was here when Peter was our deputy leader on the second occasion in the Senate. I remember Peter when I first came here. He seemed to a 44-year-old a rather old man at the time. I suspect, looking back now, that he was only a young fellow! He was a very kindly man, although clearly he had a very quick mind and decisive wit that was able to be used by all of his then colleagues when they needed some information, a good thought or some wise counsel on a particular matter. He nurtured me and others in our early stages in this Senate. It was clear to see then why he had had such a distinguished career in law and in the service of the Liberal Party over many years.</para>
</talk.start>
<para>I, like others, want to mention his contribution to the freedom of information laws, which, as has been said, he introduced. I had heard of him well before I came to the Senate because of the work he had done on freedom of information. His long and distinguished career is justifiably recognised today in the Senate. As I said, I want to be associated with the comments about him and to extend my condolences to his wife, Isabel, and family.</para>

<para>—Congratulations, Mr President. This is my first opportunity to congratulate you and I do so. It was a very good result. I associate myself with the comments made by the previous speakers in relation to Peter Durack. Peter Durack was a senator who I succeeded in this place and who I paid tribute to in my first speech when I came to this place. In my maiden speech I recorded then the great contribution that Peter Durack had made to the parliament and to Australia, and I do so again on his passing.</para>
</talk.start>
<para>Peter Durack was an outstanding lawyer. He came from a family that was well respected in Western Australia and, indeed, in politics. As Senator Johnston previously indicated, he made an outstanding contribution to the Liberal Party in Western Australia. In fact, it is quite significant that he was a member for the state seat of Perth. I do not think we have ever held the seat since. We held it for one term. When you look at the demographics of Perth, it was no mean feat that he won that seat. He then went on to excel in the Senate and as Attorney-General. Mention has been made of the freedom of information legislation which he championed, but I think that he was also regarded as an extremely safe pair of hands for the government of the day. That was due to his judgement, wisdom and sound legal intellect.</para>
<para>I mentioned his contribution to the Liberal Party in Western Australia. I saw firsthand that contribution at our state council as a younger member of the Liberal Party. I can say that when there was a great deal of turmoil, debate and controversy Peter Durack always came through with a calm, cool head to provide wise advice to those who were there. I certainly think that on more than one occasion he provided sound direction for the party at its meetings. Of course, he was state president, as Senator Johnston mentioned, and he had extensive involvement in the party as such.</para>
<para>He was a great Western Australian and a great credit to his family. They can all be very proud of him. I know both his son and his daughter, Pip and Anne. To them and the wider family I convey my condolences and say to them on his passing that they can be very proud of his achievements.</para>

<para>—No, Jim Short won it. Peter Durack was a very good mentor in that first year and a bit that I was here in the parliament. He was regarded, along with Brian Archer, as a father of the party. They were the two people who had been here from 1975 onwards—and I think in the case of Senator Durack it was even earlier than that. The whole family life of Senator Durack, coming as he did from that great Western Australian family, meant that he was held in some awe by some people here not only because of his contribution to the Senate and to the government of the day but because he was a very thoughtful person as I—a young senator coming into this place—remember him.</para>
</talk.start>
</continue>
<para>Peter Durack’s contributions have been well documented here today, so I am not going to go over those again. An enormous number of new senators have entered this place today—and in the past three years there has been, I think, something like 37 new senators—but to new senators coming into this place I would say that the amount of experience that you can get by talking to people who have been in this place for some time is invaluable. I counted Peter Durack as a very wise mentor. He only ever offered advice when you asked for it. He was not one who thrust his views or opinions on you. He was indeed a gentleman. Certainly the people I remember most from my early days in the Senate were those who had been in this place for a long time and who were prepared to share their experiences both in government and in opposition with those of us who were new. Who could forget Shirley Walters, Brian Archer, Peter Durack and a whole range of people who were finishing their Senate careers? I think they all finished in 1993 or thereabouts. But I do want to associate myself with this condolence motion because senators who make the sort of contribution that Senator Peter Durack made do not come past every day. I certainly offer my sympathy to his family; they can be sure in the knowledge that Peter Durack will be well remembered for his contribution to the Senate.</para>

<para>—I commence my remarks by joining others in congratulating you, Mr President, upon your election to the very high office which you have achieved today. I think there would not be a dissenting voice in the Senate to the proposition that you are eminently equipped for this task and have earned great respect and deep personal affection among all of us.</para>
</talk.start>
<para>I wanted to make a few remarks on the passing of the late Peter Durack. Unlike other Liberal senators who have spoken on this condolence motion, I did not particularly know Peter Durack, although I had the pleasure of meeting him a couple of times, albeit briefly, when I was very young. Peter Durack will be remembered in particular for three things. First of all, he represented a very old-fashioned ethic of public service. He was a person who chose to devote the prime years of his life to service in parliament and to involvement in politics—three years, as we have heard, in the Western Australian state parliament; 22 years in the Senate and, in between those two terms of parliamentary service, as a party officer as the state president of the Western Australian Liberal Party. It is a theme I have elaborated upon several times, but I think it is very sad—particularly, if I may say so, for my side of politics—that that ethic of public service, of which the late Peter Durack was so obviously an exemplar, seems to be lacking from the professions today. Too few people turn away from professional life, whether as lawyers, doctors or whatever among the learned professions, to give their lives to public service as Peter Durack did. I think that the professions have been the poorer for it and I think that the parliament has been the poorer for it. The ethic of public service represented by Peter Durack is something that I hope we have not completely lost but it is certainly more a feature of an earlier age than it is of the current age. An aspect of that ethic of public service, as we have heard from all the Liberal senators who have spoken so far in this debate, was the role of Peter Durack as a mentor to younger senators. I remember my old friend former senator Chris Puplick telling me once about how Peter Durack had mentored him when he was a firebrand young Liberal senator in the 1980s.</para>
<para>The second thing for which Peter Durack should be remembered and celebrated, particularly on my side of politics, is that he was a Menzies Liberal. He was a representative, an exemplar and a champion of what I have always considered to be the mainstream position of the Liberal Party—the Menzian tradition. In fact, his first involvement in the Liberal Party came in 1944, the year in which Sir Robert Menzies—Mr Menzies as he then was—founded the Liberal Party. Peter Durack, then a student at the University of Western Australia, co-founded the University of Western Australia Liberal Club. The year in which he was first elected to parliament as the state member for Perth in 1965 coincided with the last year of Sir Robert Menzies’ second prime ministership. He was a Menzies Liberal in the sense that he represented the liberal values which have always been the pride of the Liberal Party. In an obituary of Peter Durack that appeared in the <inline font-style="italic">Sydney Morning Herald</inline> last month, the observation was made:</para>
<quote>
<para>He said on his retirement: “I accept the fact that I’m a fairly conservative lawyer, I guess.” Yet, at least with hindsight from beyond the Howard government years, much of his work was in the liberal, rather than conservative, tradition.</para>
</quote>
<para class="block">This was a view corroborated by Mr Howard himself, who, in another obituary, described Peter Durack as probably being ‘on the small ‘l’ liberal side of politics on social issues, but an economic rationalist’. So, from my point of view as a small ‘l’ liberal on social issues and as a rationalist on economic issues, the late Peter Durack represented the best of both of the traditions of the Liberal Party.</para>
<para>Thirdly, he will be remembered for his service with distinction as a minister in the Fraser government. As others have said, he was Minister for Repatriation for about a year and then, after the resignation of Bob Ellicott, was Attorney-General for more than six years. The historical reputation of the Fraser government has in recent years suffered something of a devaluation, but I think that, like all reputations, as we achieve greater historical perspective, many of the great achievements of the Fraser government will come to be reconsidered and re-evaluated and perhaps appreciated more both by historians and by people in my own party than they have been more recently.</para>
<para>Peter Durack was associated with many of those achievements. He was, in particular, one of Australia’s most illustrious and longest serving attorneys-general. Others have spoken of the many beneficial law reforms with which he was associated, most particularly as the pioneer of the Freedom of Information Act, although I might point out that he was an opponent of the notion that Australia should have a statutory bill of rights. So his liberalism was leavened by a wise and sceptical conservatism as well, which is a very attractive combination. He was in fact the last Liberal Attorney-General to serve in the Senate.</para>
<para>I conclude my tribute to and appreciation of Peter Durack by saying that the more that Australia’s parliaments, both state and federal, attract people of that calibre and with that ethic of public service and dedication to public life the better we will be. We remember today an exemplary figure in that tradition and we mourn his passing.</para>

<item label="(a)">
<para>Four years ago, more than 100 fishermen in Queensland were deemed criminals by the Federal Government for innocently dropping a fishing line in water which is part of the Great Barrier Reef Marine Park. These fishermen had a criminal conviction recorded against them and were fined $2500 each.</para>
</item>
<item label="(b)">
<para>These fishermen are your ‘average Joes’. They’re recreational fishermen; granddads taking their kids fishing or group of mates in a ‘tinnie’. What they have done, usually through ignorance or a lack of navigation skills, is simply drop a line in the wrong place, which does not warrant a criminal conviction.</para>
</item>
<item label="(c)">
<para>Two years ago the Federal Government admitted it was wrong to give criminal convictions and downgraded the offence to an infringement, with an $1100 fine and no criminal conviction. However, the more than 100 fishermen originally convicted still have a criminal conviction recorded against their name.</para>
</item>
<item label="(d)">
<para>Having a criminal record can seriously damage a person’s life. You’re deemed in the eyes of the law to be a criminal which can make it impossible to get a job, insurance or a home loan. You can’t travel to certain countries and can’t get a licence for occupations like being a real estate agent or publican. Every government form requires you to declare if you have a criminal conviction.</para>

<para class="block" pgwide="yes">The Government acknowledges the importance of the committee’s research into the Indigenous visual arts sector, and the value of its findings in contributing to the growth and stability of the sector into the future. The report highlights the economic, social and cultural benefits of the Indigenous visual arts sector to local communities and its wider impact on other sectors and the nation generally. As stated in the report, these benefits can be reinforced and developed through a coordinated whole of government response to the recommendations.</para>
<para class="block" pgwide="yes">The Government recognises the success of the Indigenous visual arts sector including the creation of an internationally acclaimed art movement, representing a dynamic living culture that helps define Australia’s identity.

The Government also acknowledges that the Indigenous visual arts sector faces a number of challenges.</para>
<para class="block" pgwide="yes">The Government considers it has an important ongoing role in the building of a strong and sustainable Indigenous visual arts sector which is reflected in this response to the committee’s recommendations.</para>

<para>That the Senate take note of the report.</para>
</motion>
<para class="block">I will try not to speak too long on this. I understand some other senators may wish to speak on this matter as well. I am pleased to note the tabling of the report of the inquiry into an opposition private member’s bill entitled <inline ref="S631">Save Our Solar (Solar Rebate Protection) Bill 2008 [No. 2]</inline>, which was considered by the Senate Standing Committee on the Environment, Communications and the Arts. The bill requires new rebate guidelines to be determined via a legislative instrument subject to parliamentary scrutiny and potential disallowance by either house of parliament but effectively by the Senate.</para>
<para>The opposition hoped that the inquiry from this bill would uncover some kind of approaching Armageddon in the PV solar panel industry in Australia. However, the inquiry found that the industry, while changing, is in fact very robust because Australian consumers and domestic households in particular are taking up rebates offered under the government’s rebate program at higher rates than before the budget announcement about the means test.</para>
<para>The committee received 150 submissions from witnesses in this inquiry and we heard evidence in Canberra, Melbourne, Adelaide, Perth and Brisbane and telephone evidence from other states and territories. The majority report is supportive of the government’s handling of the rebate program and it recommends that the opposition bill does not proceed.</para>
<para>The report’s main findings include the increased uptake of the Solar Homes and Communities Plan since the budget. A recommendation addresses the fact that households are installing systems of around one kilowatt that are largely affordable within the maximum rebate allowable of $8,000, while perhaps larger sized systems would be preferable. The committee also found that the industry itself would much prefer the introduction of a feed-in tariff scheme that offers more certainty over a longer period of time than rebate schemes which can be vulnerable to government policy or, as this bill anticipated, vulnerable to the whim of the Senate.</para>
<para>I note in that context that several states and territories are putting in place, have considered or are considering feed-in tariff schemes to further support the use of solar PV systems and possibly other forms of microrenewable energy. The government recognises that fact and agrees that adopting an approach that is as consistent as possible across the country can go a long way in helping reduce the regulatory burden and costs on the electricity market as well as on consumers. I am pleased to note that COAG will consider options for a harmonised approach to feed-in tariffs at its October meeting this year. The committee that inquired into this bill will also be examining such a scheme during our coming inquiry into the Renewable Energy (Electricity) Amendment (Feed-in-Tariff) Bill 2008.</para>
<para>The opposition has put in a fairly predictable dissenting report which projects gloom and doom in the industry, an industry that is actually showing signs of moving from being a cottage industry to being a very mature industry. Yes, there are some adjustments. But we are also seeing potential investment in the industry from companies operating in the global market.</para>
<para>The opposition, throughout this inquiry, did nothing to address the repeated calls of the industry in Australia for certainty about what was going to happen in the future, and instead we had the opposition, throughout this inquiry, whipping up fear and uncertainty in the PV industry by alleging—like Chicken Little—that the world was going to end, the sun was going to stop shining and that everything was going to be disastrous when, in fact, there was no good evidence to support that at all.</para>
<para>It was intriguing that earlier on today in this chamber we heard, on a number of occasions, other senators on this side noting that the opposition could have different opinions on the same topic on different days, depending on which different members of the opposition were speaking. We heard that certainly in the context of the River Murray during question time. It is not unusual for this opposition to support something one day and then reject it the next, and perhaps that is why they were rejecting a policy that, with regard to the means test on the rebate scheme, is in fact a policy very similar to their own. I wonder whether they have forgotten about the $100,000 means test on solar hot water rebates that was implemented by the then Minister for the Environment and Water Resources, Mr Malcolm Turnbull, when that program was introduced in July 2007. It is probably worth reiterating that on the 17 July 2007, Mr Turnbull issued a press release stating:</para>
<quote>
<para class="block">The rebate is available to eligible applicants who are replacing existing electric storage hot water systems with eligible solar or heat pump systems purchased and installed after today and verified by a registered agent. The home must be a principal place of residence and the applicant’s taxable family income must be less than $100,000.</para>
</quote>
<para class="block">That sounds very familiar. Never let the facts and history get in the way of a good story when it comes to the opposition!</para>
<para>Our change to the Solar Homes and Communities Plan rebate brings it into line with the Solar Hot Water Rebate Program. That program, as I said, was introduced by the previous government. So we have brought those two programs into line but, more importantly, we have greatly increased the funding available for the program per year. Whereas the previous government’s plan was to budget $150 million over five years for 15,000 rebates, I am proud to say my government dedicated $150 million over three years for 15,000 rebates in the recent budget and we doubled the number of rebates available from 3,000 to 6,000, doubling our election commitment and doubling what the previous government had budgeted for this year.</para>
<para>With the ongoing success of this program, we have now said that we will continue to meet demand for the program—a fact that the opposition chooses not to throw into the mix of scaremongering when it is whipping up the industry to be afraid of the future of government support for renewable energy sources in this country. It is clear that the driving force behind the opposition bill was that it hoped for—it actually wanted—a decrease in the number of solar rebate applications following the introduction of the means test. That is what it wanted, and it was very disappointed when the numbers did not stack up and the number of rebates increased.</para>
<para>As of a couple of weeks ago, an average of 522 applications per week had been lodged since the budget for the rebate available under this excellent program. That is 150 more applications per week than were made prior to the budget and way beyond the 30 weekly applications at the time of the last coalition budget. In one week alone we noted that there were 794 applications for the rebate, post the budget change which included a means test so that this program could be targeted at low-income Australian families who most need assistance to install alternative energy sources in their homes.</para>
<para>Of course, I could go on about other excellent measures that the government has taken to improve the uptake of renewable energy sources, not just in people’s homes but in our communities and schools, but perhaps I will leave that for another day, given the time. The committee did note, as I said, the trend to smaller systems as people use the maximum amount of rebate to buy what they can afford, and the committee realise that that trend is not new. In fact, it started when the previous government increased the rebate to $8,000, and that information was verified by the federal Department of the Environment, Water, Heritage and the Arts. The department alerted us to that fact.</para>
<para>The fact that solar systems are becoming more affordable for low-income families is an excellent thing, a great thing for our nation. Actually, that is exactly what a former environment minister, Ian Campbell—they have had a few former environment ministers over there—called for in 2006 when he said that the solar rebate scheme should be targeted at low-income families. But, of course, that was another day and another position from the opposition on this very important issue.</para>
<para>In closing, I would like to thank the other members of the committee, who participated in this inquiry with goodwill and cooperation. Also, I would like to thank the secretariat and the many people who made an effort to contribute to the inquiry into this bill.</para>

<para>—I am pleased to rise to speak on the committee report of the inquiry into the <inline ref="S631">Save Our Solar (Solar Rebate Protection) Bill 2008 [No. 2]</inline> and related matters. I am amazed to have heard Senator McEwen wanting to talk about certainty for the industry in regard to this inquiry. I am quite amazed because Senator McEwen knows all too well that this is an industry desperate for certainty, desperate for clarity, and it is finding absolutely none of it from the current government.</para>
</talk.start>
<para>What was very clear through this inquiry was that the introduction of means testing came with absolutely no consultation with the industry beforehand. They had every belief, every high hope going into the budget this year, that the new Rudd government would, if anything, expand support for their industry. They believed quite strongly that the new Rudd government would actually deliver for the solar industry, because they had seen all the hype. They had heard all the noise. They had seen the now Prime Minister go and stand alongside solar operators just outside Canberra. They saw him actually stand beside Phil May at his business, Solartec, praise the industry and talk about the potential of the solar industry.</para>
<para>They had every reason to believe that the new government was going to be a friend of the industry, and yet instead what happened on 13 May this year with absolutely no hint, no consultation, nothing at all, was of course that the government—the government that had with much fanfare signed Kyoto, the government that had spent the entire election campaign talking about climate change at every opportunity—just suddenly introduced a means test on the solar panels rebate. It did so at a time when the industry itself was just starting to gain some confidence, was just really taking off. It did so at a time when the industry was looking forward to the future, having built strong capacity in that sector.</para>
<para>Having seen the rebate increase from $4 per watt to $8 per watt up to a maximum of $8,000 early in 2007, the industry had confidence in its future. It had confidence that the rebate was there to stay to meet demand, and it had that confidence because the coalition government had given a five-year commitment and appropriation to the rebate. It had confidence that the funds would be there because the then Prime Minister himself gave a public and personal commitment that, if demand outstripped the funds that had been allocated, more funds would be made available. That was the type of certainty the industry had enjoyed. It enjoyed the clear certainty of a five-year program, an $8,000 rebate with funding committed by the then Prime Minister.</para>
<para>Instead, we get the change of government. Despite all their rhetoric around climate change, they come in and pull the rug of certainty out from underneath the solar industry. They pull that rug of certainty out and leave the industry with a program radically diminished. It is radically diminished because they cut the length of the program from five years down to three years. It is radically diminished because they cut off at the knees the types of installations happening in this sector that were going to give it the capacity and strength it needed for the long term. By that I particularly mean the size of the installations that were occurring.</para>
<para>The most damning evidence we received during this inquiry came quite clearly from those who said that the size of solar systems being installed was now much smaller than had been the case previously. In fact, when the government officials finally appeared at this inquiry—and I will come back to the government’s approach to the inquiry in a moment—we saw evidence given that the size of the systems had reduced by more than 20 per cent. It is not that the government is actually giving smaller rebates—the government is still giving the maximum $8,000 rebate for each of these systems—but it is doing so and getting 20 per cent less renewable energy as a result. I would love to hear Mr Garrett try to tell us how it is a good policy outcome to spend $8,000 a pop to generate 20 per cent less renewable energy thanks to his policy of means testing. What he has done by introducing the means test is he has cut out all of those households who could actually afford to put in larger systems—households that were looking at putting in three-kilowatt or four-kilowatt systems, households that would have put in systems that would have met their own energy consumption and fed into the national grid. They have been cut out of the system as a result of this means testing.</para>
<para>Instead, we hear the government wanting to crow about the fact that applications have continued to increase. Yes, applications have continued to increase. They have increased for a number of reasons. One of those reasons is the surge in bulk purchase schemes of the smallest possible system. The Queensland government themselves introduced a bulk purchase scheme for 1,000 systems of one kilowatt in size—so the smallest system to get $8,000. We saw them introduce that scheme in a manner that has artificially propped up the number of applications for the smallest possible system. They are one-kilowatt systems that will not meet the energy demands of most of the households, certainly will not feed into the grid, and are a long way short of actually delivering the type of growth in renewable energy, the type of growth in capacity in the industry, that is needed. So one reason we see the surge in numbers is certainly this surge in bulk purchase schemes.</para>
<para>Another reason we see this surge in numbers is actually the very lack of that certainty that Senator McEwen was speaking of before, because the industry and consumers are concerned that, having seen a means test implemented, having cut off a large swathe of the population—all households with a gross income over $100,000—from being eligible for this rebate, people are understandably concerned that maybe the whole rebate will go sometime soon. Of course, as speculation mounts that that whole rebate could be cut off, people are getting in while they still can. They are getting the applications in. They are scared at the lack of certainty given by this government and so they are getting in and boosting those short-term applications.</para>
<para>There are also concerns because you are now dealing with a much smaller marketplace. We did not have one industry operator come to us and tell us that this was good policy—far from it; every industry operator who came to us came and said they thought this was a bad policy decision. They came and told us that they had lost sales as a result. Most told us that in fact they had not managed to sell a single photovoltaic system to a household which was over the means test threshold. So that entire section of the community has been cut off from purchasing systems because there is no incentive.</para>
<para>Many people came to us and said to us that they were happy to spend a little bit more on a system—that, indeed, if they had to dip into their pockets a little deeper, they would have done so. But for households who were looking at contributing between $5,000 and $15,000 of their own hard-earned towards buying a system, suddenly discovering that it was going to cost them an extra $8,000 on top of that was just too big a burden to bear. So it is little wonder that that sector of the population now are not purchasing systems.</para>
<para>There is a concern, with a rush in households under the threshold but no market in households over the threshold, about what is going to happen. Slowly but surely there is concern in the industry that that rush in the marketplace will dry up. Many people put it to us that the government had messed up its priorities on this—that it had confused what is an environmental objective with social policy objectives. As one witness put it to us quite clearly, ‘Carbon emissions are not means tested.’ Far from it. In fact, of course, a lot of those larger households with larger household incomes are emitting more—they are using more energy. So, far from it being that their emissions are means tested, it is quite the reverse. Yet the government for some reason wants to means test an environmental policy—and they did so in the crudest and bluntest of possible ways: a $100,000 household means test. <inline font-style="italic">(Time expired)</inline>

<para>—I rise to comment on the <inline ref="S631">Save Our Solar (Solar Rebate Protection) Bill 2008 [No. 2]</inline> report. One of the problems with a government-dominated committee system is that the report does not actually reflect the evidence that came before the committee. The overwhelming majority of submissions came out saying strongly that the means test was a bad idea, that it had not worked, and that, quite apart from how many were taking it up, what it did do was reinforce the stop-start-stop nature of government support, or lack of support, for solar. As a result, accountants were saying to businesses: ‘We are not prepared to have a five-year business plan or a 10-year business plan because we have no certainty. This could be cut off again next year.’ What they overwhelmingly said was that, whilst they want the rebate reinstated in the way it was and to get rid of the means test, what they really wanted was a gross feed-in tariff to give certainty into the long term for industry. Overwhelmingly, businesses came before us and said that they had been planning on putting on more staff, expanding the business and so on and have not been able to do it because they now have no certainty.</para>
</talk.start>
<para>The really interesting thing with this is that the government is facing an embarrassing situation. My understanding is that, since the budget, they have had around 6,000 applications and all the money that was budgeted is effectively gone—in four months what was effectively a year’s allocation is gone. What is the government going to do now? Is it going to say, ‘Our intention at the start was that it is overheating—that is, we are spending too much money on this’? It is actually the planet that is overheating, not anything else. So the upshot here is that the government have a situation where they have so many applications they have run out of 12 month’s budget in four months. What next? When are we going to have the announcement from the government saying that the rebate is over for this year? Or are we going to see an announcement from the government saying, ‘Next year’s budget allocation is going to be brought forward,’ which is clearly one thing they could do and should do in order to make sure that there is no stop-start again, because you will have a stop in a minute if you have spent all the money allocated in the first four months since the budget. What are we going to do? Wait eight months before the rebate starts again? What is the government going to do?</para>
<para>I put to the government, and particularly Minister Garrett: what are you going to do now? The solar rebate was overheating and now it has boiled over completely. They have spent the money and they have run out of their allocation for this year. Bring forward next year’s allocation at the very least so that things do not stop. More particularly, there has to be a huge amount of effort going into getting a national gross feed-in tariff because it is very clear the community wants to be enabled to take up photovoltaics. The community also wants to be enabled to go beyond rooftop solar and to have, for example, utility size solar thermal facilities.</para>
<para>I welcome Premier Carpenter’s announcement yesterday in Western Australia that he is bringing in a gross feed-in tariff, but again it is only at residential scale. We need it to be for utility scale as well. We need this to be rolled out on a large scale because the lie has been put absolutely to the claims that have gone on around this place for years that renewable energy is only a fringe dweller and cannot produce the kinds of loads we need. It not only can but would, if it were enabled to do so.</para>
<para>I respect the fact that the government have at least acknowledged that the submissions have overwhelmingly said a gross feed-in tariff is where people want to go. I am glad the government have acknowledged that the changes have simply meant that there are smaller systems and so we are not getting the maximum uptake of renewable energy that we could from the rebate that is being paid. But the big question hanging in the air for every solar business is: what is going to happen now that the rebate is fully taken up?</para>
<para>Could the government and Minister Garrett tell us: has the full amount been expended—applied for and effectively allocated? If so, what are you going to do about it? Is next year’s allocation going to be brought forward? Please announce it soon, because every one of the small businesses whom we have spoken to and who have put in submissions wants to know. If you have this massive application load now and they are refused on the basis that the allocation has run out, then that will dry up and these small businesses will be stuck for the next eight months—going out of business, having to put people off. It will just be reinforced that, as long as the solar industry is dependent on the whims of government ministers deciding on the basis of budget allocations whether they want to stoke or choke renewable energy, we are just going to have a situation where investors, venture capitalists in particular, are going to back away.</para>
<para>I think it is unfortunate that this report does not reflect the evidence that came before the committee more accurately. Nonetheless, I look forward to a gross feed-in tariff. I have a bill in front of the Senate and I am looking forward to the inquiry into it. But what we need right now is not only an acknowledgement from the government that there have been a lot of applications but the acknowledgement that the money has been expended. The question we want the answer to is: what is going to happen for the next eight months?</para>

<para>—I start my contribution with a quotation:</para>
</talk.start>
<quote>
<para class="block">The Rudd Government does not appear to be serious about tackling global warming. Rudd’s claim that ‘climate change is the great moral challenge of our age’ has clearly been forgotten or blatantly disregarded.</para>
</quote>
<para class="block">That quote comes not from a Liberal Party fancier but from none other than Mr Dean Mighell, the State Secretary of the Electrical Trades Union, Southern States Branch, in his submission to the inquiry. This act by the Rudd Labor government at budget time, without any warning, without any mandate, without any consultation—simply introducing a means test for the subsidy—clearly shows how hypocritical the Rudd government is in relation to climate change and alternative energy.</para>
<para>Unfortunately, I was only able to attend one day of the hearings. Somewhere along the line it got difficult for the participating members to find out when the committee was sitting. The day of hearings that I sat through in Melbourne clearly showed that the industry, environment groups, community groups, councils and individuals from the general public were absolutely aghast at a government that many of them conceded they had voted for because, amongst other things, they liked Mr Rudd’s ideas about Kyoto and saving the planet’s environment. They went with him in the election in 2007, and they more than others felt absolutely betrayed by the action in relation to the means test on this rebate. We heard witness after witness in Melbourne and we read submission after submission of those that came in—small businesses, industry people and tradesmen whose lifelong ambition to have a successful small business was shattered by Mr Rudd overnight on budget night.</para>
<para>The submissions we got mirrored the response I got the day after the budget in Townsville in North Queensland, where I have my office—a city that boasts 300 days of sunshine every year and, because of that, a city that is very keen on the use of solar energy. Two small business men in Townsville came to me almost in tears. One of them admitted that for the first time ever he had voted Labor because he had liked Mr Rudd’s approach to the environment and to alternative energies in particular. They were almost in tears because the businesses they had been building up over the last two to three years were shattered overnight. They gave facts of people ringing up the day after the budget saying: ‘I’m sorry. I know I have a contract with you, but I simply cannot afford to go through with it.’ I seek leave to continue my remarks later.</para>

<para class="block">I want to talk to the tabling of a rather important report into Australia’s more recent involvement in peace-keeping operations. It is an important report because, over time, the nature of our peace-keeping missions has changed quite dramatically. In the early years, Australia served in small contingents, primarily as military observers monitoring truce lines with the consent of the host countries, particularly in the Middle East, Syria and Egypt. In recent times, though, Australia has engaged in peace-keeping missions that have been both complex and broad in scope. Most of these operations now involve intrastate conflict, internal conflict, and have been difficult and at times quite dangerous undertakings. Australians deployed to these complex missions have included more recently not only military personnel but also active representatives from agencies such as DFAT, AusAID, the Australian Electoral Commission and Treasury, to name a few, as well as large numbers of police and, increasingly, scientific experts.</para>
<para>Regional engagement is a major element in Australia’s current involvement in peacekeeping. Indeed, Australia’s significant commitment and lead role in operations in the region is one of the more recent notable developments. For example, as we all know, Australia commands the International Force for East Timor and leads the regional mission to the Solomon Islands. These operations indicate the growing importance of Australia engaging in peacekeeping and leading peace-keeping missions in this part of the world. They also show that the scope of today’s peace-keeping operations has expanded and continues to expand to focus on helping to create long-term stability in what is properly described as a set of fragile states.</para>
<para>The committee’s inquiry centred on Australia’s whole-of-government, whole-of-nation approach to peace-keeping operations—that is, from the earliest decision making and planning stages to the final reporting and evaluation stages that occur. The committee’s two key recommendations were directed at developing and improving whole-of-government policy on Australia’s engagement in peacekeeping. The committee found a most compelling argument for a white paper on Australia’s involvement in peacekeeping. Despite dramatic changes to peace-keeping operations, particularly over the last 10 or 12 years, and Australia’s increased and broadening engagement in such missions, there is, to date, no policy document that presents a whole-of-government approach to peacekeeping. The committee believes it is time for such a document to be put together and published by government. The production of a white paper would provide government and its agencies with the opportunity to review their policies and practices and would enable a better understanding of how each group’s activities contribute to the whole-of-government effort.</para>
<para>The committee welcomed the government’s decision to establish an Asia-Pacific centre for civil-military cooperation. Based on the evidence, however, the committee could see advantages in expanding the scope of the institution’s mandate. It was concerned that important decisions were being made about the role, the function and structure of the centre without a proper scoping study. There are now a number of highly regarded overseas institutions in this field. The committee recommended that a specially selected task force conduct such a scoping study. The team would visit existing peace-keeping institutes to help them formulate recommendations on the centre’s design to ensure that it becomes the hub of a national network of institutions, a national repository of information and learning on peacekeeping, a regional centre of excellence and a vital part of the international web of similar institutes throughout the world.</para>
<para>The committee made recommendations about the fundamental elements that should be articulated in a mission’s mandate. In this regard, the committee emphasised the importance of having an exit strategy. The committee argued that an exit strategy would provide a road map—that is, a structured plan for achieving the stated purpose—and contain benchmarks against which progress toward those objectives can be measured. It recommended that, when considering a proposed peace-keeping operation, the government examine in detail the mission’s exit strategy to ensure Australia’s contribution is part of a well-planned and structured approach to achieving clearly stated objectives.</para>
<para>A number of recommendations were made to ensure peacekeepers are better prepared to meet the challenge of today’s mission. In particular, the committee emphasised the importance of interoperability at all levels and between all elements of an operation. It found the ADF and the AFP have not always been able to operate smoothly together in the field. This is due in some measure to a lack of familiarity and important differences in work culture. It also found current peace-keeping training programs for Australian public servants could be better structured in keeping with the whole-of-government approach. Australian NGOs could also improve their standard of training for their people who are sometimes involved in peace-keeping operations. The committee recommended that defence review its CIMIC doctrine and consider ways to strengthen its CIMIC capability. The committee also noted that NGOs could facilitate better coordination with the military through better organisation and liaison amongst themselves. DFAT and AusAID could also assist cooperation and coordination between government and NGO sectors by extending activities beyond briefings to joint training and collaborative planning.</para>
<para>The committee recognised that the relationship with the host country and other partners in a peace-keeping operation is critical to the success of a mission. However, building a constructive coalition sometimes presents quite large challenges. The committee found that to produce effective peacekeepers Australia must prepare its personnel to be part of an Australian force, a partner of the host country and a member of a coalition of participating countries.</para>
<para>The committee stressed the importance of predeployment language and cultural awareness training. It also recommended that exchange programs and joint exercises with personnel from countries in the region continue as a high priority. It suggested that such activities form part of a broader coherent whole-of-government strategy to build a greater peacekeeping capacity in this part of the world.</para>
<para>In considering the health, safety and wellbeing of Australian peacekeepers, the committee identified a number of concerns. They related to the accessibility of data on the health of Australian peacekeepers. There are inadequacies in the ADF’s health records management and postdeployment care of peacekeepers with respect to mental health problems. The report made a number of recommendations to rectify these identified deficiencies.</para>
<para>I have referred to the committee’s recommendations for a white paper and for an expanded and more ambitious Asia-Pacific centre for civil-military cooperation. They are the means to inculcate a culture of continuous learning and continuous improvement in Australia’s peacekeepers. The committee noted that if government agencies are to learn from and build upon their experiences in peacekeeping then they need to strengthen their evaluation and lessons-learnt processes.</para>
<para>Last year marked the 60th anniversary of Australia’s commitment to peacekeeping. I take this opportunity to acknowledge all who have contributed to a series of peace-keeping missions over the years. Finally, I wish to place on the public record my thanks for the invaluable assistance provided by Dr Dermody and her staff on the relevant Senate committee. I seek leave to continue my remarks later.</para>

<para class="block">On behalf of the Joint Standing Committee on the National Capital and External Territories, I have pleasure in speaking to this report, which was tabled out of sittings on 16 July 2008. It is entitled <inline font-style="italic">The way forward: inquiry into the role of the National Capital Authority.</inline>
</para>
<para>The committee, through this inquiry, has examined the current planning arrangements with a view to reducing red tape and confusing duplication in the Australian Capital Territory but at the same time ensuring that the Commonwealth has a direct and enduring role in the future of Canberra. The committee focused on the administration of the National Capital Plan and the role that the National Capital Authority has within its charter and the act.</para>
<para>Canberra is one of very few planned cities, and everyone who comes here is struck by the beauty of the landscape architecture—the way in which the city is built into the landscape. This is, of course, the specific design by Walter Burley Griffin and Marion Mahony, who won a competition to design Australia’s national capital. One of the issues that were traversed very well in the inquiry was: what is the Commonwealth’s relationship with the national capital and what role do they have in ensuring that its particular design, unique as it is, continues long into the future?</para>
<para>The mechanism by which this is ensured is the National Capital Plan and the act, which is currently administered by the National Capital Authority. So, many of the recommendations associated with this report look to the way forward in the operation of the National Capital Authority in the administration of the plan. The vision that we have expressed in this report identifies the need for a significant upgrade. Since self-government of the ACT in 1989 we have had almost a demarcation organised between the territory government and the Commonwealth government, and the committee felt that that needed to be renewed and some structural changes made to the National Capital Authority to allow the Commonwealth to truly assert its interests in the national capital and for the territory government to gain the clarity it is seeking in its role with both land administration and planning jurisdiction.</para>
<para>Unfortunately for the National Capital Authority, the organisation endured cuts that, according to the committee’s findings, were not commensurate with the overlap that we foreshadowed and identified as part of our deliberations. The committee’s findings were that those cuts went too deep and have not permitted the National Capital Authority to discharge its duties in accordance with both the aspiration of reducing red tape and the decision to make the organisation more effective and more focused on its role. So obviously we have made recommendations in relation to the necessary resources for it to discharge its role and, perhaps more importantly with an eye to the future, the resources necessary to upgrade the National Capital Plan and have it work effectively with the territory planning authorities and other organisations to allow the upgrade to proceed. I am sure senators will appreciate that planning in the ACT raises the intense interest and passions of many different stakeholder groups and individuals in our community. It is a truly worthy project to get right, and the recommendations contained in this report point to a very comprehensive agenda to achieve those outcomes.</para>
<para>The committee identified three objectives that we would like to achieve as part of this upgrade plan in <inline font-style="italic">The way forward</inline>. The committee’s first objective is to ensure that the Commonwealth protect and promote the unique design of Canberra because it represents the intrinsic character of the national capital. The committee’s second objective is, where possible, to align land administration with planning jurisdiction, provided the first objective is achieved. The third objective is to foster greater cooperation and collaboration between the Commonwealth and the ACT governments on planning and related matters.</para>
<para>With these objectives in mind we have put forward a series of recommendations that look at the different roles of the National Capital Authority and how they ought to be constructed in the future. In particular, the emphasis has been on governance and administration. The committee have recommended that we overhaul the governance and administration arrangements for the National Capital Authority, choosing the model of stronger statutory independence with much more stringent reporting lines to the Commonwealth parliament to ensure the appropriate level of Commonwealth oversight in what is truly the national capital interest in planning in the ACT.</para>
<para>Another area of great concern, which I am sure my colleagues can relate to, is the way that transport planning has not been a feature of consideration of the function of the National Capital Plan in recent times. This is partly a product of the overlap between the two planning systems but it also points to a need for far greater integration into the National Capital Plan of planning, transport issues and transport sustainability. What we found in the course of this inquiry is that we were not able to resolve the final planning matters; hence our recommendations for an upgrade. And it was further made difficult by the fact that the National Capital Authority came forward with some pretty comprehensive suggestions and quite interesting ideas, but of course other submitters and participants in the inquiry were not able to fully analyse the proposals that had been put forward because it was at the committee hearings that they first received a public airing.</para>
<para>I would like to acknowledge the secretariat and the amazing work that they did in preparing the report and supporting the public hearings. I would like to mention them all by name: Stephen Boyd, Stephanie Mikac, Justin Baker, Margaret Atkin, Frances Wilson and Natasha Petrovic. Thank you very much for your hard work. I would also like to acknowledge other members of the committee, including my deputy chair Mr Patrick Secker, and particularly mention Annette Ellis and Senator Gary Humphries, who I think is going to be speaking to the report as well. This was a bipartisan report, and I would particularly like to acknowledge the time that Senator Humphries put in to achieving this result. It is quite an extraordinary thing, given the controversial nature—the cross-government nature of planning in the ACT—that we were able to reach a bipartisan conclusion on a way forward. I think it is a great credit to the process of the committee system that we were able to do that.</para>
<para>I would like to also thank everyone who participated in the inquiry. We had many submissions from many organisations which had to come forth with their thoughts without too much notice. It was a pretty tight time frame for a committee inquiry that covered such complex issues, so I would particularly like to thank all of those concerned citizens not just here in Canberra but from around the country whose passion and interest in the national capital is unfailing for the insights and inspiration that they gave us as committee members to help us find a way forward to resolve the problems and issues and to take planning in the ACT to the next level of maturity 20 years after self-government. I commend the report to the Senate.</para>

<para>—by leave—The National Capital Authority, as anybody who has observed ACT planning over a period of time will note, has been something of a political football. Headlines have regularly been generated around its activities and its role, and questions about the planning of the city, particularly in its national capital manifestation, have been very much argued over and fought over throughout the years. Yet, as Senator Lundy has noted as the chair of the committee, what the joint standing committee has produced in this case is a unanimous report which is designed to attempt to take a step away from that divisive and acrimonious approach to the planning of Canberra. I think it is because all the members of the committee saw very clearly that it is a nonsense to have a single, relatively small city of 330,000 people or so run by two separate planning systems which are in conflict, or perceived to be in conflict, with each other. It was the view of the committee that some better way needed to be found to ensure that the city was planned in a way which did not pit the national capital role and the community of Canberra role against each other.</para>
</talk.start>
<para>I also commend to the Senate and to the government the scheme which the committee has put forward to attempt to resolve that very difficult problem. The committee has essentially recommended that we attempt for the first time to integrate the two planning regimes. We have two plans: a national capital plan and a territory plan. We have two planning systems around those two plans, and we have two planning authorities administering each of those plans. We have not proposed the integration of all three of those components or elements but we have certainly suggested that there be a single, integrated planning document with clear boundaries between the two areas of planning responsibility. We suggest that planning responsibility be aligned with ownership of the land—where the Commonwealth owns land, essentially it should have planning responsibility for that land and, where the ACT government owns the land, it should have planning responsibility. Those who are familiar with the present system would know that that, unfortunately, is not the case—that there are areas of territory land which are effectively controlled by the Commonwealth and vice versa.</para>
<para>We hope that this is an opportunity to realign those planning responsibilities and to establish a clearer, more workable system of running a national capital with the values that Canberra clearly has, and the chair has talked about those values. I expect that this would involve—as this process goes forward—some retreat by the NCA geographically speaking away from some areas of the territory which it has had primary planning responsibility for in favour of the ACT government. But the report strongly suggests that that be achieved by ensuring that the ACT planning process builds in very strongly those national capital values which are so important to the planning of the whole city. In a sense, those values imbue the planning of the city from the top to the bottom of the territory. It is not just about the Parliamentary Triangle; the whole city is an example of fine, world-class planning, and those values need to be understood and adopted by each planning authority no matter what its actual responsibility for particular geographical areas might be.</para>
<para>I also want to touch on the question of the cuts to the NCA’s budget. The inquiry heard persistent and loud complaints about the effect of those cuts on the operations of the NCA and the capacity of the NCA to plan a world-class city in those circumstances. We saw a combination of the increased efficiency dividend and quite specific cuts to the NCA resulting in some very serious and concerning developments. We saw that public facilities—like the Carillon, Blundells’ Cottage and the National Capital Exhibition Centre, which is where people get a sense of what the planning of Canberra is all about—have been adversely affected by those very serious cuts. We were told before the cuts were implemented—indeed, we were told before the last election—that there were inefficiencies in the way in which government ran those areas, that their structures were top-heavy in their administration and that overlapping responsibilities between the federal and territory planning roles would account for an amount that could be saved in terms of rationalising that role. That was all found to be essentially bunkum. What the report found is that there were serious compromisings of the capacity of Canberra to be planned well by virtue of those cuts. Particularly, the committee focused on the $46.3 million cut to the Griffin legacy project, which has a huge impact on the planning of that northern part of the Parliamentary Triangle which abuts Constitution Avenue. I welcome very strongly the committee’s encouragement to the Commonwealth to restore those funds. That would be crucial to the capacity of the ACT government to be able to make decisions about the planning of that part of Canberra in a proactive and effective way into the future.</para>
<para>I must also say that claims which have been made in the past about the National Capital Authority being some kind of political tool, particularly of the former government, were claims that were not substantiated or borne out by this inquiry. The evidence—and it was very strongly asserted by the NCA itself—is that it always made decisions on the basis of what was best planning practice, not what was dictated by political masters. It is true that the committee has recommended that the board of the NCA should be restructured: it should be larger and it should be appointed in a more transparent way to reflect particular skills in planning and design that need to be present on a board like that. It also recommended a need to have a more national focus, with people from outside the ACT, but the committee did not find that the board had been previously used as a political tool and that this process needed to end.</para>
<para>I want to finish my remarks by saying that one of the possible by-products of this inquiry was that the Chief Executive of the NCA, Ms Annabelle Pegrum, chose to announce her retirement during the inquiry. I want to say that it is perhaps not very helpful at this point in time to reflect on the circumstances which might have led her to make that decision, but I will say that I think her legacy to the NCA was one of enormous quality. She had held that role for a number of years, through a number of different chairs of the NCA. The commitment and dedication that she brought to that role as a practising architect are reflected in the quality of so many things that the NCA was able to achieve. I do not want this opportunity to go past without being able to record the great contribution she made as the Chief Executive of the NCA to the high-quality national capital that we see around us today. Many things happened during the life of the previous government to enhance the vision of Canberra, and the NCA was responsible for the delivery of most of those things. The tribute to her, the success of her contribution in that role as CEO, is the great national capital we see around us, particularly with those enhancements.</para>
<para>I want to indicate that the committee unanimously felt that there should be a world-class national capital in Canberra and that the planning authority should be resourced to maintain the excellent planning values of the city, and the NCA was affirmed in this process as the custodian of those very high-quality values. We did not find, as some thought we might find, that the NCA should be replaced or subsumed; we affirmed the role of the NCA. I think that members of this place would do well to focus on the need to make sure that this body is capable in the future of delivering the kind of high-quality national capital that all Australians should be proud of. I think that the effect of the recommendations made by the committee will be that there is a strengthening of that role by the National Capital Authority. If we remove the tensions and friction which have been characteristic of the relationship in the past, we will certainly achieve that goal into the future.</para>

</list>
<para class="block">There has been a great deal of public disquiet about the Exclusive Brethren sect, which now Prime Minister Rudd as shadow foreign affairs minister commented upon back in September 2006 when he called for a review of federal funding of Exclusive Brethren schools. He said:</para>
<quote>
<para class="block">On their role in politics ... they are such a secret society and secret sect ... But my broader concern goes to the extent that the Exclusive Brethren-run schools. The Exclusive Brethren, based on my advice, actively discourages children from using information technology, from learning how to use computers properly because they will provide avenues of contact with the outside world.</para>
</quote>
<para class="block">As opposition leader in August last year, when stating that he had refused to meet with Exclusive Brethren members and calling on then Prime Minister John Howard to come clean on his links with the Exclusive Brethren, Mr Rudd said:</para>
<quote>
<para class="block">I believe this is an extremist cult and sect. I also believe that it breaks up families, I also believe that there are real problems with the provision of modern education to kids under their system where they, for example, are not given full range of access to the full range of information technology ...</para>
</quote>
<para class="block">I can add to that the fact that some thousands of Australian children who happen to have grown up within the Exclusive Brethren sect are denied their proper and free opportunity to tertiary education in this country. I cannot imagine any religious—or other sect, for that matter—getting away without a thorough inquiry into their denying thousands of Australian children their basic and fundamental right to tertiary education. It simply would not happen.</para>
<para>The Exclusive Brethren, who are prodigious lobbyists right across the political spectrum and in all parliaments in Australia, state and territory as well as federal, manage to deny these kids—thousands of them—their right to a tertiary education. It is as if they have some other right as part of the Australian community and are able to withdraw, quite arbitrarily, this fundamental right of those children who happen to have been brought up within the sect.</para>
<para>The inquiry I am proposing would look at such matters. It perhaps would also look at the $10 million paid to five Exclusive Brethren schools around Australia in January this year. Those schools have a combined population of just 2,000 students. Over the next four years, these same schools will collect almost $50 million in taxpayer subsidies. An additional $502,000 in funds under the federal Investing in Our Schools Program will go to them, and that program allows smaller grants for the construction of projects costing less than $75,000.</para>
<para>The Prime Minister is quite right about the way in which the Exclusive Brethren orders its education program. He has referred in particular to the difficultly in the past of children in those schools getting access to computers and technology. They were banned for a long time. That has changed more recently under an arrangement whereby the Elect Vessel of the Exclusive Brethren, who is a multimillionaire, has set up a company to specifically give or sell computers within the Exclusive Brethren sect that are particularly dealt with to prevent the essential outside contact that computers give to children generally in this nation.</para>
<para>The Australian Federal Police are still investigating the Exclusive Brethren’s $370,000 donation to then Prime Minister Howard’s coalition in the 2004 federal election. I think the Senate has every right to ask why, four years after a large donation was made to a political party in this parliament, the Australian Federal Police have not completed that inquiry and reported publicly. What is it that has taken so long about that inquiry, which was initiated after concerns were expressed by the Australian Electoral Commission? Then in April this year, after 33 ex-brethren members called on Prime Minister Kevin Rudd to support this inquiry that we are now dealing with in the Senate, a letter came from Mr Rudd’s chief of staff, David Epstein, to Mr Peter Flinn, who had sent that letter on behalf of the 33 ex-brethren members. In that letter Mr Epstein said:</para>
<quote>
<para>The Prime Minister has asked me to acknowledge and respond to your letter dated 25 February written for and on behalf of 33 ex-members of the Exclusive Brethren.</para>
<para>I acknowledge, in particular, the moving personal accounts contained in the thirteen ‘life stories’ appended to that letter.</para>
</quote>
<para class="block">I am not able to provide the Senate with those life stories, for two reasons. Firstly, they are very harrowing and personal. However, I invite any senator who wants to, to see those stories. Secondly, and more importantly and of greater concern, the people who wrote those stories fear punitive action from the Exclusive Brethren hierarchy against them or their loved ones, particularly those who are still in the brethren, were their identities to be revealed. The letter from Mr Epstein went on to say:</para>
<quote>
<para>The Prime Minister does not resile from the views he expressed last year about the Exclusive Brethren. In particular, the Prime Minister remains concerned about the reported imposition of doctrines that weaken family bonds. He also remains concerned about reported doctrines that prevent children accessing online learning tools.</para>
</quote>
<para class="block">The letter goes on:</para>
<quote>
<para>I note your observations on the role played by Exclusive Brethren members in recent Australian electoral campaigns. The Government is committed to enhancing transparency in our electoral system and has recently announced reforms related to the disclosure and sources of donations. A Green Paper on electoral reform will be released for comment later this year.</para>
<para>While appreciating your deeply held concerns, the Prime Minister cannot agree to your request for a wide-ranging inquiry into the Exclusive Brethren. The Government believes that such an inquiry could unreasonably interfere with the capacity of members of the Exclusive Brethren to practise their faith freely and openly.</para>
<para>Religious observance should not be regarded as a shield behind which breaches of the law can be hidden.</para>
</quote>
<para class="block">It then goes on to say:</para>
<quote>
<para>Any alleged breaches ... should be brought to the attention of the appropriate agency for investigation.</para>
</quote>
<para class="block">Beyond that, the fact is that the Prime Minister knows very well, and has expressed it in the matters I have just brought before the Senate, the alarming opinion that so many people have formed about the way in which people within this sect are deprived of their liberties, are threatened, are harassed and are denied the opportunities that other Australians have. It is very much proper that there should be a Senate inquiry into this matter.</para>
<para>I have circulated to party leaders a copy of the letter that was sent to Prime Minister Rudd which evinced Mr Epstein’s response. I am hoping that overnight the parties will look at that letter and provide any amendments or deletions they wish to make, because I wish to incorporate it into <inline font-style="italic">Hansard</inline>. I will do that, hopefully, when the debate continues. This is a very important inquiry. It is one about the lost rights of some thousands of Australians who deserve to have their plight opened to the light of day. I put it to honourable senators that this inquiry should proceed. It is the bailiwick of this Senate to look at just matters like this when there are citizens suffering and being manipulated and deprived of their rights.</para>

<para>—I rise today to support this motion to refer this matter to a committee. There have been many debates in this chamber relating to this matter and it is very disappointing to me that the government has backed away from an inquiry. The matter I would particularly like to speak on this evening is education. I think it is a terrible thing that we have got Commonwealth funding going to schools where there is an active prohibition on young people going on to further education. Exclusive Brethren young people are not allowed to attend university. Girls are not allowed to do manual arts subjects. They know that there will be an arranged marriage for them within the Exclusive Brethren community, and that is their fate whether they like it or not.</para>
</talk.start>
<para>When I taught at Devonport High School back in the early 1980s, at that stage there were no Exclusive Brethren schools as such and some of the students came to Devonport High. I had a particularly bright young woman in my class, and I urged her to go on to the Don College and I talked to her about the opportunities in higher education and so on. Her parents complained to the principal of the school that I was filling her head with ideas that were contrary to their aspirations for her, that she would not to be going on to further education, that she would be married and that when she got married she would not be working again because married women in the sect are precluded from working.</para>
<para>So I had a situation where this young girl with her life ahead of her, with huge potential, was being shut down in terms of any aspirations other than an arranged marriage within the sect and, once the arranged marriage took place, no working life thereafter.</para>

<para>With reference to the Treasurer’s statement of 27 June 2007 on the release of the 2006 census information that ‘the Census forms the basis for our electoral system, the provision of services and policy to meet the challenges that we face’: does this mean that the effects of fly-in and fly-out workers who record their domicile elsewhere, or of transient/tourist numbers, will not be sufficiently taken into account for the provision of services in shires such as Roebourne and Wyndham East Kimberley; if not, how are fly-in fly-out or transient/tourist requirements factored in.</para>
</item>
<item label="(2)">
<para>Given that, according to the recently released Australian Bureau of Statistics (ABS) census figures, in the Kimberley Region, between 2001 and 2006, the population of Broome has risen by only 1.8 per cent, or 1 240 people, and in the Shire of Wyndham East Kimberley, by just 0.4 per cent, or 133 people: (a) why do these figures differ from the shires’ views as to significant real population growth; and (b) how were these figures arrived at, given, for instance, that school student numbers, a good indicator of permanency, in the region have risen by more than this amount in absolute terms (e.g. at Kununurra District High School, by at least 13 per cent).</para>

<para>Do census collectors obtain accurate figures from Indigenous communities in the Kimberley; if not, what is the degree of error.</para>
</item>
<item label="(4)">
<para>Has the ABS investigated its figures to determine how such apparent small rises in overall population in the Kimberley can be possible, given the rise in housing demand and construction in these areas since the 2001 census and the overall increase in numbers of children enrolled in the local schools, in some areas, up at least 10 per cent.</para>
</item>
<item label="(5)">
<para>Given that, according to an ABS seminar in Kununurra in 2007, the community was advised that the figures for the 2006 census were collated based on ‘place of enumeration’ while the method used in the 1996 census and the 2001 census was ‘usual place of residence’: (a) what impact has this change had on the census outcome; and (b) have Australians still continued to identify their usual place of residence (e.g. Perth) rather than place of enumeration (e.g. Argyle Mine).</para>
</item>
<item label="(6)">

<para>—The Treasurer has provided the following answer to the honourable senator’s question:</para>
</talk.start>
<quote pgwide="yes">
<list type="decimal">
<item label="(1)">
<para>The 2006 Population Census asked about each person’s place of usual residence and determined their place of enumeration. Questions were also asked about each employed person’s location of work. The information on place of usual residence and location of work is provided by respondents and reflects their interpretation of the questions. However, it might be expected that fly-in fly-out workers would give a place of usual residence different to their location of work. Thus, information from the census can be used to analyse the numbers of people whose place of enumeration was different from their usual residence (which would include tourists), or the number who work in an area but have a usual residence in another region (which would include fly-in fly-out workers).</para>
<para>Following each census, the ABS undertakes a Post Enumeration Survey (PES) to measure the over and under count that occurs during the census. The results from this survey are used in the determination of the official Estimated Residential Population (ERP).</para>
<para>The ERP takes into account the census usual resident count for a region, estimates of net undercount in the census from the PES, and other population factors such as the number of Australian residents temporarily overseas on census night. Use of ‘place of usual residence’ as the criteria for geographic distribution in population estimates is consistent with international recommendations for estimating population statistics. It is the official ERP for a region that is used to determine funding through the Grants Commissions.</para>
<para>The ABS is not in a position to comment on how fly-in fly-out or transient/tourist numbers are factored in when determining provision of services.</para>
</item>
<item label="(2)">
<list type="loweralpha">
<item label="(a)">
<para>The percentages quoted in the question are the annual average growth rate for the ERP over the 5 years between 2001 and 2006, and not the overall growth rate between 2001 and 2006.</para>
<para>        The percentages for the overall growth rate between 2001 and 2006, for preliminary ERP estimates, show the population for Broome has increased by over 9 per cent during the 5 year period, while Wyndham-East Kimberley has grown by 1.8 per cent (see the ABS publication Regional Population Growth, Australia, 1996-2006 (cat. no. 3218.0) published on 24 July 2007, which is available on the ABS website).</para>
</item>
<item label="(b)">
<para>The ERP figures are arrived at using the methodology established for determining the resident population of an area at 30 June each year. Information on this methodology is available in the explanatory notes of the publication mentioned in 2(a).</para>
</item>
</list>
</item>
<item label="(3)">
<para>The ABS has, after consultation with representatives from a range of organisations associated with Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people, developed an Indigenous enumeration strategy. This strategy is a collection of procedures that allows for potential barriers to the effective enumeration of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people in the census to be addressed. The ABS believes that this strategy is also effective in minimising undercount, although there will inevitably be some error.</para>
<para>The PES undertaken after the census includes Indigenous communities, however, estimates of net undercount are not available for small areas. The estimated net undercount for Indigenous Australians in the 2006 Census was 59,178, representing a net undercount rate of 11.5 percent with a standard error of 2.3 percentage points (see the ABS publication Census of Population and Housing - Details of Undercount, Australia (cat no. 2949.0)).</para>
</item>
<item label="(4)">
<para>See the answer to question 2.</para>
</item>
<item label="(5) (a)">
<para>and (b) There was no change in the way census information was collected about ‘place of enumeration’ and ‘place of usual residence’. The only change was in the timing of the release of census data. Prior to the 2006 Census, the first figures released from the census were based on ‘place of enumeration’. For the 2006 Census, the census counts for both ‘place of enumeration’ and ‘place of usual residence’ were released at the same time.</para>
</item>
<item label="(6)">
<para>As discussed in (1) above, Commonwealth funding allocations to states and territories are based on the ERP figures published by the ABS. The state level ERPs are compiled using Population Census results, estimates of net undercount from the Post Enumeration Survey, estimates of Australian residents overseas on census night, birth and death registrations, net overseas migration, and net interstate migration statistics. They are not compiled using housing demand and school enrolments directly. However, counts of building approvals and other administrative data are used in estimating population growth between censuses in areas below the state/territory level (see the answer to question 2).</para>
<para>The ABS understands that the Commonwealth funding allocations to states and territories are determined based on the ERP, combined with adjustment factors compiled by the Commonwealth Grants Commission.</para>

<para>—The Treasurer has provided the following answer to the honourable senator’s question:</para>

<quote pgwide="yes">
<list type="decimal">
<item label="(1)">
<para>The Australian Prudential Regulation Authority (APRA) has advised that the information sought in the question includes protected information under the Australian Prudential Regulation Authority Act 1998 (APRA Act). In ordinary circumstances the provision of protected information would constitute a criminal offence. While parliamentary privilege provides a defence to such a charge, APRA notes the public interest arguments in maintaining confidentiality over protected information provided to it by regulated entities. APRA further notes that there is litigation between third parties traversing the same or similar subject matter. For these reasons, APRA prefers not to respond to this question publicly beyond providing material already in the public domain.</para>
<para>Australian Home Warranty Pty Ltd is not and never has been an APRA regulated entity. Mr Murray Nugent has only ever been subject to APRA regulation to the extent that he was a senior manager of Reward Insurance Ltd (RIL), which was a regulated entity until its authorisation was cancelled on 22 March 2004.</para>
<para>APRA did not at any time place a formal restriction on RIL on writing licensed builder home warranty insurance (LBHWI) from 1 July 1999 onwards. APRA provided non-binding advice to RIL on 20 June 2001 that it should not write LBHWI until its reinsurance program included an approved reinsurance program for its builders warranty insurance.</para>

<item label="(3)">
<para>Currently, APRA does have the power to disqualify an individual from holding positions such as a director and senior manager in general insurers. However, the Financial Sector Legislation Amendment (Review of Prudential Decisions) Bill 2008 which was introduced in the Senate on 13 February 2008 will introduce a court-based disqualification regime for responsible persons, including a director and senior manager in general insurers, under which the Federal Court may, on application from APRA, disqualify a responsible person.</para>
<para>APRA is aware of serious allegations regarding the conduct of Mr Nugent. However, APRA has advised that the parties making the allegations are not disinterested, and APRA has formed the view that neither the limited material provided by those persons, nor other material in its possession, is sufficient to warrant any action against Mr Nugent.</para>
<para>However, APRA notes that three individuals have referred material on an ongoing basis to a number of other Regulators, State Police Departments and various Ministers and that material included various written allegations against a number of individuals, including Mr Nugent. APRA has offered to provide assistance to other relevant agencies on request.</para>
</item>
<item label="(4)">
<para>APRA has advised that RIL was not under its Minimum Statutory Capital requirements from late 2001 until 30 June 2002.</para>
<para>Following the enactment of the General Insurance Reform Act 2001, all authorised Australian Insurers who wished to continue underwriting insurance risks were required to be re-authorised by 30 June 2002. RIL was reauthorised under the Insurance Act 1973 (Insurance Act) on 26 June 2002. A condition on the re-authorisation was that RIL maintain a Minimum Capital Ratio of at least $6.0 million in net assets. It satisfied that condition at that time.</para>
<para>On 10 October 2003, as a result of work conducted by APRA a decision was taken to initiate a formal investigation. This decision resulted from APRA’s concerns about a probable breach of RIL’s Minimum Statutory Capital and concerns that it may not be able in the long to sustain the commitments it had made to its policyholders. The investigation confirmed the breach of statutory capital requirements.</para>
<para>In November 2003, APRA accepted a public enforceable undertaking from RIL that resulted in it entering into a Heads of Agreement in December 2003 for the commercial sale of its policyholder liabilities and associated assets to another existing authorised Australian insurer. The sale was concluded in March 2004 and on 22 March 2004, APRA revoked RIL’s authority to carry on insurance business.</para>
<para>As a result of APRA’s intervention, and consistent with its mandate to act to protect the interests of policyholders, no RIL policyholder lost any insurance benefit.</para>

<para>In July 2001, APRA discovered that an asset held by RIL may have been pledged as security to a bank, and would therefore be excluded from assets by section 30 of the Insurance Act. If the asset were excluded by section 30, then RIL may not have met the minimum solvency requirement under the Insurance Act. APRA therefore issued a letter to RIL, asking it to show cause why APRA should not commence an investigation. RIL responded to APRA’s concerns in such a way that no investigation was commenced at that time.</para>
</item>
<item>
<para>As a result of insurance reforms, all authorised Australian insurers which wished to continue underwriting insurance risks were required to reapply to APRA to remain an authorised Australian insurer. RIL submitted an authorisation application and APRA advised it by letter dated 26 June 2002 that it was re-authorised under subsection 12(2) of the Act and that a number of conditions were imposed under paragraph 13(1) (a).</para>

<para>The Australian Securities and Investments Commission (ASIC) is an independent statutory authority responsible for the administration of the Corporations Act 2001 and related legislation. As an independent statutory authority, the conduct of ASIC’s investigations and enforcement activities is generally a matter for its discretion. In seeking to protect the integrity of its operations, ASIC does not generally comment on its investigations.</para>
<para>ASIC has advised that it has conducted an assessment of the issues raised in relation to RIL and has exercised its discretion not to commence a formal investigation under section 13 of the Australian Securities and Investments Commission Act 2001 into the company or its directors. In addition, ASIC advises that it has considered the conduct of the company in the past in response to complaints it has received; however, the complainants involved have repeatedly failed to provide evidence to support their allegations.</para>

<para>The National Pollutant Inventory (NPI) is the only nationwide, publicly accessible inventory of substance emissions in Australia.</para>
<para>For NPI reporting purposes, emissions are defined as the release of an NPI substance to the environment – whether in pure form or contained in other matter and /or in solid, liquid or gaseous form. All emissions are separated into emissions to air, land and water. Reported emissions are aggregated by substance from a facility, and facilities are not required to provide data in any more detail other than “emissions to water”. The proportion of an emission from formation waters is not required to be reported, under the NPI National Environment Protection Measure (NEPM), neither is the breakdown and concentration in milligrams per litre.</para>
</item>
<item label="(4)">
<para>Every year, Australian industrial facilities that exceed specified thresholds of the 93 NPI substances must estimate and report their emissions directly to their state or territory environment agency. These agencies review all NPI reports for accuracy and forward the data to the Australian Government. The reports are then displayed on the NPI public website.</para>

<para>In relation to the Government’s commitments made in the policy fact sheet ‘A national energy efficiency goal’, the Australian Government is both progressing the implementation of specific election commitments and has established an Energy Efficiency Sub-Group of the COAG Working Group on Climate Change and Water to advise COAG on options to accelerate or expand the uptake of energy efficiency measures, including the need for a comprehensive and integrated approach.

<para>The Government is conducting a national cost benefit analysis on the roll out of smart meters. Public comments on costs and benefits have been received and will be taken into account in finalising the analysis. In December 2007, the Ministerial Council on Energy agreed that under any rollout plan, a consistent National Minimum Functionality is necessary to maximise the benefits of smart meters across all stakeholders, and referred an initial set of functions to further work by a technical stakeholder group.</para>

<para>Australia welcomed the reports from the International Assessment of Agricultural Knowledge, Science and Technology for Development (IAASTD). Australia was an active participant and supporter of the IAASTD process and acknowledges many of the key observations in the reports. The wide range of observations and assertions in the reports, some of which were contradictory, meant that Australia could not accept or approve the reports in their entirety. Nevertheless, there is a large amount of material which the government will use as input to future deliberations on agricultural knowledge, science and technology and its capacity to reduce poverty and hunger in developing countries.</para>
<para>The Government welcomes research undertaken by the FAO (both in this report and in others) and takes account of FAO recommendations when developing agricultural policies. The Government regards the FAO as the lead UN agency for advancing the comprehensive range of issues relating to agriculture, forestry and fisheries.</para>

<para>(5)   I am advised by the Minister for Innovation, Industry, Science and Research that CSIRO has been a strong supporter of the Cooperative Research Centre (CRC) program and has participated in 122 of the 167 CRCs established since the commencement of the program. CSIRO is co-investing in 38 of the 58 current centres. The decision by CSIRO to support and be part of a CRC is based on strong strategic alignment with its own strategic plan, particularly where there are opportunities to build large-scale projects to address significant national challenges, as well as consideration of whether joining a particular centre is the optimal arrangement for use of CSIRO capabilities in a particular area. These principles are applied uniformly to all CRC applications. CSIRO staff can only recall the circumstances around one bid for an Organic CRC in 2004. The reasons for not participating in the Organic CRC bid were twofold. First, the responsible lead Division was heavily involved in two other bids in that round, and the relevant staff were already overcommitted. Secondly, the bid did not align with CSIRO’s research strategy.</para>

<para>(6)   (a)   The Department of Agriculture, Fisheries and Forestry funds agricultural research through its two portfolio bureaus, the Australian Bureau of Agricultural and Resource Economics (ABARE) and the Bureau of Rural Sciences (BRS). In 2007-08, $18.6 million (5.1 per cent) of departmental appropriations revenue was allocated to agricultural research with $6.2 million provided to ABARE and $12.4 million to BRS.</para>
</item>
<item label="">
<para>While outside the scope of the Senator’s question, the Department of Agriculture, Fisheries and Forestry also receives administered and special appropriations revenue which is allocated to agricultural research. The largest proportion of this revenue was provided to the 16 Rural Research and Development Corporations and Companies (RDCs).</para>
</item>
<item label="">
<para>In 2006-07 the total expenditure by the RDCs was $525 million, which included industry levies of $232 million and a government contribution of $209 million. It is not possible to determine the relative proportions of research monies spent on- or off-farm.</para>

<para>Agricultural research on helping primary industries adapt to, and mitigate the impact of, climate change is being funded through administered appropriations under the $46.2 million Climate Change Research Program, a component of the $130 million Australia’s Farming Future initiative.

<para>I am advised by the Minister for Innovation, Industry, Science and Research that CSIRO continues to place strong emphasis on agricultural research. World-wide trends are seeing a shift in the kind of research conducted away from extensive field based work to more laboratory work and computer-based modelling. These trends are as apparent in agricultural sciences as well as other disciplines in science. The CSIRO strategic plan recognises the need to focus its research investments on the wider challenges to food production viability in Australia resulting from climate change, water availability, environmental footprint and global competition in commodity production costs, rather than near-to market research activities. Adjustments to CSIRO’s overall budget for 2008–09 has resulted in some redirection of its agricultural research portfolio, leading to growth in investments for research that underpins work in these areas, such as transformational biology; while redirecting some funding from incremental research and management overheads.</para>

<para>I am advised by the Minister for Innovation, Industry, Science and Research that an objective of CSIRO’s Strategic Plan is to accelerate science and technology transfer. This includes a framework of principles for effective and appropriate management of intellectual property rights that is capable of adapting to sectoral needs. Accordingly, CSIRO enters into a wide array of arrangements with its customers in order to maximise benefits to Australia. This ranges from co-investments towards particular research outcomes where generated intellectual property rights might be shared between the parties, to direct delivery of research services on a cost recovery basis with the customer retaining the intellectual property rights. CSIRO carefully evaluates each proposal based on a consistent framework of principles in order maximise the benefit to Australia from technology transfer and commercialisation, while maintaining appropriate patent protection of its own inventions.</para>

<para>The Kyoto Protocol accounting rules determine that when a relevant forest is harvested, the carbon stocks, including those of the logs removed from the forest, are reported as an emission of greenhouse gases at the point of harvest. Relevant forests are plantations established since 1990 on previously unforested land.</para>
<para>The United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change accounting rules provide for reporting of greenhouse gas emissions from wood products harvested from all managed native forests and plantations. Carbon dioxide emissions from harvested wood that occur when it is processed and during the service life of all wood products are reported in the Land Use, Land-Use Change and Forestry component of the National Inventory Report. Emissions from wood products in landfill are reported under the Waste section of the inventory.

<para>—The Attorney-General has provided the following answer to the honourable senator’s question:</para>
</talk.start>
<quote pgwide="yes">
<list type="decimal">
<item label="(1)">
<list type="loweralpha">
<item label="(a)">
<para>A review of the Marriage Celebrants Program commenced in 1996 and reforms to the Program resulting from that review took effect 1 September 2003. The standards of services provided by Commonwealth-registered marriage celebrants have improved to some extent since 2003 as their knowledge of their obligations has increased. However, I am advised that poor practices do still continue with some celebrants who were appointed both prior to and after introduction of the 2003 reforms. This is demonstrated, for example, by celebrants’ understanding of the form of marriage ceremony to take place, and their understanding of their obligation to explain the nature of the marriage relationship to the marrying parties (sections 45 and 46 of the Marriage Act 1961 refer). On the other hand, the number of formal complaints about celebrants has been low, indicating relative satisfaction from the public. One of the objects of the review of the training required to apply for marriage celebrant registration, and marriage celebrants’ annual ongoing professional development obligation is to address these shortcomings over time.</para>
</item>
<item label="(b)">
<para>&amp; (c) Since introduction of the 2003 reforms, Commonwealth-registered marriage celebrants have been obliged to conduct themselves according to the Code of Practice for marriage celebrants prescribed by the Marriage Regulations 1963. Clause 6 of this Code of Practice obliges those marriage celebrants to maintain an up-to-date knowledge about appropriate family relationship services in the community, and to inform marrying couples about the range of information and services available to them to enhance and sustain them throughout their relationship (s. 39G of the Marriage Act, Regulation 37L of the Marriage Regulations refer). This obligation did not exist prior to 2003. The aim of this obligation is to ensure marrying couples are equipped with information about the services that can assist them in their relationship – even if couples choose not to avail themselves of this type of service at the time they are marrying, they may wish to do so at a future stage in their relationship.</para>
<para>The 2003 reforms to the Program also introduced a requirement for a person aspiring to become a marriage celebrant to demonstrate that they have specific qualifications and/or skills for the role. In most cases, this means an aspiring marriage celebrant must complete a particular unit of competency through an appropriate training organisation. The unit of competency includes training in this family relationship service obligation, and in all aspects of marriage celebrants’ obligations under their Code of Practice.</para>
<para>Once an aspiring celebrant has completed the appropriate training or assessment of their skills, they need to fill in an application form and provide certain documents to the Registrar of Marriage Celebrants, so they can be considered for registration as a marriage celebrant. One aspect of this process requires applicants to provide information to establish their commitment to advising couples of the availability of relationship support services. To complete this part of the process, an applicant must list a number of such relationship support services for couples in their area, including the services’ contact details. They must also describe the major relationship support services offered by those organisations, including the availability of the services they have described.</para>
<para>Since 2003 Commonwealth-registered marriage celebrants have been obliged to complete five hours of ongoing professional development each year. Activities that have been listed as appropriate for this purpose have included several aimed at enhancing celebrants’ knowledge and skills in order to fulfil their obligation regarding family and relationship services. Since 2003 there have been 69 such activities available that would assist in this area.</para>
</item>
</list>
</item>
<item label="(2)">
<para>I am advised that registered training organisations (RTOs) offering training for work as a marriage celebrant must comply with the national guidelines and quality standards that apply to all vocational and educational training (VET). The standards are set by the National Quality Council and published in the Australian Qualifications Training Framework, which stipulates that the minimum qualification for all VET sector trainers is a Certificate IV in Training and Assessment and vocational competencies at least to the level being delivered. Marriage celebrancy trainers may possess a variety of qualifications in addition to these minimum requirements.</para>
</item>
<item label="(3)">
<para>I understand that registering authorities require evidence that an RTO meets the standards I have referred to in (2) above before it can be registered to deliver a particular course. State and Territory government registering authorities are not required to report to the Attorney-General’s Department because they report to the National Quality Council. The Government is represented on the National Quality Council, as are State and Territory governments, peak industry bodies and peak training organisations. The Ministerial Council of Vocational and Technical Education, which includes all Ministers for Training in Australia, has approved these quality arrangements.</para>
</item>
<item label="(4)">
<para>The auditing of Registered Training Organisations (RTOs) and TAFE college Celebrancy courses is the responsibility of State and Territory registering bodies under VET sector requirements and I am advised that these bodies do audit RTOs if issues of performance or compliance arise.</para>
</item>
<item label="(5)">
<para>There is a range of skills required to perform the role and fulfil the obligations of marriage celebrant. State and Territory bodies assess registered training organisations on their expertise to train marriage celebrants in all of the skills necessary to perform their roles.</para>

<para>I am advised that non-compulsory ongoing professional development activities have been approved through an application process, and that part of that process has included consideration of proposed activity presenters’ qualifications, skills and experience to deliver the particular activity concerned. The Attorney-General’s Department has taken a broad view in considering proposed presenters. Until the current year, a similar process was adopted for applications to deliver compulsory ongoing professional development activities – this process included consideration of proposed presenters’ qualifications, skills and experience to deliver the compulsory activity concerned. Because the current year’s compulsory ongoing professional development activity had very complex content and required several different modes of delivery apart from the lecture style adopted in previous years, a more stringent selection process was employed. This process included an expression of interest stage, and a preparation and assessment stage.</para>

<para>I am advised that it is not customary to set a minimum number of hours for vocational education training but nominal hours are specified and for the current unit of competency these were set at 120 hours. However, I am advised that the actual number of hours undertaken varies considerably. This is an issue that has been considered in the current review of the Community Services Training Package, of which marriage celebrant training forms a part. The review, which began in July 2006, is being conducted by the Community Services and Health Industry Skills Council, and is now approaching the final stage. The third and final draft of the revised training package is expected to be released for endorsement by industry in September 2008. It will then be submitted to the National Quality Council for approval and publication.</para>

<item label="(15)">
<para>The existing training course, the unit of competency Plan, conduct and review a marriage ceremony, does contain all of these elements and I am advised that it was expected that it would satisfactorily cover all the skills and knowledge needed if delivered thoroughly. The training review I referred to in (14) above has considered the components of the required training and has drafted a new course, a Certificate IV in Celebrancy. If adopted as part of the revised Community Services Training Package, it will enhance celebrant skills and knowledge.</para>

<para>The fit and proper person test for marriage celebrants is set out in Section 39C of the Marriage Act.

I am advised that the examples listed in the question would be covered by the trainer who is required, under the unit of competency, to ensure that the learner has knowledge of a celebrant’s obligations under the Code of Practice for marriage celebrants.</para>

<para>No, the Government has not established an advisory group of practising celebrants. The feasibility of doing this is limited by the number of associations that represent groups of practising marriage celebrants (18 at 24 July 2008). It is the Attorney’s view that marriage celebrants would benefit from all the representative associations coming together to discuss their roles and responsibilities. The formation of one, national representative body would be a good outcome, but such a move should be initiated by the celebrant sector itself, as this would enhance the credibility and recognition of such a body.</para>

<para>Ministers of religion may be registered as marriage celebrants to perform marriages under two separate appointment processes set out in the Marriage Act.</para>
<para>A minister of religion from a recognised denomination (declared as such by the Governor-General under section 26 of the Marriage Act) is registered under specific criteria set out in sections 29-31 of the Marriage Act. They are registered by Registrars of Ministers of Religion who are the Registrars of Births, Deaths and Marriages in each of the States and Territories. They are registered solely to perform marriages according to the rites of their religious body or organisation. They are not registered by the Commonwealth. My Department does supply information about important matters such as changes to the law concerning marriage to Registrars of Births, Deaths and Marriages and to recognised denominations. Such information is then provided to their ministers of religion.</para>
<para>Ministers of religion from independent, non-aligned religious bodies or organisations or no organisation at all (that is, not recognised denominations) may apply to the Registrar of Marriage Celebrants to be registered as a marriage celebrant under the Commonwealth program (sections 39A-39M of the Marriage Act). They must meet the same appointment criteria as all other applicants including undertaking training and satisfying the Registrar of Marriage Celebrants that they are a fit and proper person to be registered.</para>
</item>
<item label="(20)">
<para>I am not able to answer this question on behalf of a Registry of Births, Deaths and Marriages.

<quote pgwide="yes">
<para class="block" pgwide="yes">The Minister for Agriculture, Fisheries and Forestry has taken action to protect the Australian abalone industry in collaboration and consultation with Victoria. While there is no constitutional authority for the Commonwealth to direct a state government on management of a disease occurring solely within that state’s borders, national arrangements are in place for managing aquatic animal diseases under certain circumstances and these were utilised in the response to abalone viral ganglioneuritis.</para>
<para class="block" pgwide="yes">These arrangements include consultation through the Aquatic Consultative Committee on Emergency Animal Diseases (AqCCEAD – chaired by the Commonwealth) on the national technical response to the emergency, and through the Aquatic Animal Health Committee (AAHC) on on-going management of the disease. The arrangements also include guidance through the Australia Aquatic Veterinary Emergency Plan (AQUAVETPLAN). The Department of Agriculture, Fisheries and Forestry (the department) has engaged in the deliberations of both of these committees.</para>
<para class="block" pgwide="yes">The department has commissioned an AQUAVETPLAN disease strategy manual for abalone viral ganglioneuritis which will provide an agreed Australian approach to the management of possible future outbreaks of the disease. Once completed, the manual will undergo a rigorous endorsement process including review by technical experts and industry, and endorsement by governments.</para>
<para class="block" pgwide="yes">The Minister for Agriculture, Fisheries and Forestry considers efforts to limit the spread of the disease to be of significant economic and environmental importance. On 5 May 2008 the Australian Government’s Chief Veterinary Officer met with representatives of the wild-capture abalone industry from Victoria, Tasmania and South Australia in Melbourne to discuss alternative approaches to mitigating the risks posed by this disease.</para>

<item label="(1)">
<para>On 23 April 2008, the Australian Government announced the $200 million International Forest Carbon Initiative (IFCI), which replaces the previous Government’s Global Initiative on Forests and Climate. Under this Initiative, the Australian Government is providing $30 million in support of the Kalimantan Forests and Climate Partnership and a $10 million bilateral package to assist Indonesia in developing forest and climate policy and a national carbon accounting system. Additionally, the Australian Government has a $3 million Research Partnership with the Indonesian-based Centre for International Forestry Research, which will undertake research on reducing emissions from deforestation and forest degradation in a number of countries, including Indonesia.</para>

<item label="(2)">
<para>In the initial stages of the IFCI, Australia aims to increase international forest carbon accounting capacity and undertake practical demonstration activities to show that reducing emissions from deforestation and forest degradation can be included in a future international climate change agreement.

<para>Yes. The Government has already built on activities announced by the previous Government.</para>
<para>On 6 March 2008, the Prime Minister of Australia, the Hon Kevin Rudd MP, and the Prime Minister of Papua New Guinea, Sir Michael Somare, agreed to long term cooperation on reducing greenhouse gas emissions from deforestation and forest degradation. The Papua New Guinea - Australia Forest Carbon Partnership aims to address this challenge by reducing greenhouse gas emissions from deforestation and forest degradation, improving livelihoods for forest‑dependent communities and promoting biodiversity protection. International carbon markets will be important in providing the necessary investment to significantly reduce emissions from deforestation and forest degradation, and this Partnership will support both Australia and PNG’s participation in these emerging markets.</para>
<para>On 26 May 2008, the Government announced a $3 million Research Partnership with the Indonesian-based Centre for International Forestry Research and a $1.5 million package of support for international non-government organisations to develop concept models for demonstration activities to reduce emissions from deforestation.</para>
<para>On 13 June 2008, the Prime Minister of Australia, the Hon Kevin Rudd MP, and the President of Indonesia, Susilo Bambang Yudhoyono, announced the Indonesian – Australian Forest Carbon Partnership. The Partnership builds on and formalises existing long-term practical cooperation between Indonesia and Australia on reducing greenhouse gas emissions from deforestation and forest degradation.</para>
<para>Further activities will be announced as they are agreed with partner countries in our region.</para>
</item>
<item label="(5)">
<para>Following further progress in Papua New Guinea’s policy framework for reducing emissions from deforestation and forest degradation, Australia will consider support for demonstration activities under the Papua New Guinea – Australia Forest Carbon Partnership.</para>
</item>
<item label="(6)">
<para>The initial focus of the Papua New Guinea – Australia Forest Carbon Partnership is on Papua New Guinea’s carbon accounting capacity. Decisions about demonstration activities and participation in carbon markets will be made in the future.</para>

<para>—The Minister for Agriculture, Fisheries and Forestry has provided the following answer to the honourable senator’s question:</para>
</talk.start>
<quote pgwide="yes">
<list type="decimal">
<item label="(1)">
<para>Under the Australian Constitution, the states and territories are responsible for animal (including aquatic animal) disease control within their borders. The Australian Government has no constitutional powers to ‘take over’ the management of such disease situations.</para>
</item>
<item label="(2)">
<para>The Australian Government is actively participating in the National Abalone Health Management and Advisory Co-ordinating Body (NAHMACB), which is coordinating the national approach to managing the disease and associated fisheries issues. The state and territory governments have responsibility for the management of aquatic animal diseases within their jurisdiction, and this includes preventing introduction of diseases from other states and territories. South Australia and Tasmania are developing plans and strategies to contain the disease in the event of it reaching their jurisdictions.</para>
</item>
<item label="(3)">
<para>While the Australian Government has no power to direct a state government on management of a disease occurring within that state’s borders, nationally agreed arrangements are in place for managing aquatic animal diseases under certain circumstances. These arrangements include consultation through the Aquatic Consultative Committee on Emergency Animal Diseases (AqCCEAD – chaired by the Australian Government) on the national technical response to the emergency, and through the Aquatic Animal Health Committee (AAHC) on on-going management of the disease. Both these arrangements were utilised in the response to abalone viral ganglioneuritis. The Department of Agriculture, Fisheries and Forestry (the department) has engaged in the deliberations of both of these committees. The arrangements also include guidance through the Australia Aquatic Veterinary Emergency Plan (AQUAVETPLAN).</para>
</item>
<item label="(4)">
<para>The Government has already implemented this. Thedepartment has provided $35,000 to fund the development of a draft disease strategy manual for abalone viral ganglioneuritis as a new component in the AQUAVETPLAN series. This manual will provide a preferred Australian approach to possible future outbreaks of the disease. This draft manual will shortly be provided to industry and the states for comment and input into the preferred Australian response options described in this manual. Once completed, the manual will undergo a rigorous endorsement process including review by technical experts and industry, and endorsement by governments.</para>
</item>
<item label="(5)">
<para>The state and territory governments manage research of diseases within their jurisdictions. The Australian Government does not have the authority to manage all disease research in the country. However, the Australian Government does provide direction through its participation in the AAHC and the Fisheries Research and Development Corporation’s Aquatic Animal Health Subprogram. In addition, the CSIRO’s Australian Animal Health Laboratory continues to contribute significantly to investigating this disease.</para>
</item>
<item label="(6)">
<para>Individual states and territories have their own legislation and policies on aquaculture which are developed in response to the needs and requirements of the particular state or territory, including environmental impact and diseases. Under the Intergovernmental Agreement on the Environment the states and territories are required to liaise with each other where their activities may impact upon other states. If they feel that the matter is not being progressed, they may invite the Commonwealth to assist.</para>
<para>There are currently no adopted national aquatic translocation policies, as each state has legislation regarding noxious and undesirable species and restrictions on sale and maintenance of those species in that state. Local governments within each state also have policies on this matter. One of the objectives of AQUAPLAN, Australia’s national strategic plan for aquatic animal health (endorsed by Primary Industries Ministerial Council in April 2005) is to implement a common/national approach for managing pathogens associated with the translocation of live aquatic animals across Australia. The creation and adoption of National Technical Guidelines for the Translocation of Live Aquatic Animals, with respect to pathogens, was listed as a discrete project.</para>
<para>Numerous guidelines and translocation policies have been developed by jurisdictions for specific sectors, but some projects have concluded that the practicality or utility of generic, national technical guidelines (i.e. technical guidelines that apply across sectors) is limited. The focus of consultation among jurisdictions is on sharing of information to facilitate consistency between specific translocation policies, in particular regarding requirements for health testing and the cost to industry for the service.</para>
</item>
<item label="(7)">
<para>State and territory governments have responsibility for the management of aquatic animal diseases within their jurisdiction. The Australian Government is responsible for any resulting quarantine or international trade issues, making any necessary international disease notifications, and facilitating national coordination of any disease response. An independent epidemiological review of the handling of the response by the Victorian authorities is the responsibility of the Victorian Government. This disease is not confirmed to be exotic, and the most likely scenario is that it is caused by an endemic agent, originally from wild abalone, now manifesting as clinical disease.</para>

<para>- (3) Data on uptake of HPV vaccinations by numbers and percentages is not currently available. Data obtained from the Therapeutic Goods Administration (TGA) indicates that 3.7 million doses of the HPV vaccine Gardasil have been distributed since the program commenced in April 2007. However, categorisation of dosages will not be possible until the National HPV Vaccination Register is completed and fully operational in early 2009.</para>
<para>On 1 February 2008 the Department of Health and Ageing (the Department) entered into a contract with the Victorian Cytology Service to establish and maintain a National Human Papillomavirus (HPV) Vaccination Register. The purpose of the Register is to enable the Department to evaluate the success or otherwise of the National Human Papillomavirus (HPV) Vaccination Program by providing information on uptake rates and monitoring the long-term effectiveness of the vaccine in preventing certain cervical cancers.</para>
<para>Vaccination records are currently being collected and stored by immunisation providers to be added to the Register when it is operational. The Register is expected to be completed in November 2008 and fully operational in early 2009. Data on uptake by numbers and percentages of the National HPV Vaccination Program will be available at that time.</para>
</item>
<item label="(4)">
<para>Uptake of the vaccine was higher than expected. In its modelling for the GP catch-up program the Department based its assumptions, and estimates of cohorts in this age group on those used in the implementation of new vaccines. Subsequent advertising campaigns significantly raised the awareness of the program within the community resulting in a greater than anticipated uptake of the vaccine.</para>
</item>
<item label="(5)">
<para>State and territory immunisation coordinators have indicated that there has been a slight decline over recent months in parental consent to vaccinations in some jurisdictions, attributed mainly to media reports of adverse reactions to the vaccine. No other notable impediments have been identified.</para>
</item>
<item label="(6)">
<para>It is anticipated that most young women falling within the catch-up group and wishing to be vaccinated will have been vaccinated by 30 June 2009. Consideration may be given to continuing the catch-up program if there is ongoing demand beyond this date.</para>
