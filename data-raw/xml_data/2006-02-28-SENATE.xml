<para>—The legislation we are considering is the <inline ref="R2492">Future Fund Bill 2005</inline>. In speaking to this legislation on behalf of the Labor Party, I indicate that the Labor Party will be supporting it and that I will be moving a second reading amendment later, during business. This legislation gives effect to the government’s commitment to create a fund to provide for public sector superannuation liability payments. The liabilities, which are to continue to accrue, will gradually increase over the next 25 years, approximately, when they will reach a peak and then start to decline. At the present time these liabilities are paid from the budget on a pay-as-you-go basis. We pay the current age pension liabilities in the same way—on a pay-as-you-go basis. I point out that we have not set up a separate fund to pay the increasing age pension liabilities of this country. So it is not uncritical support that we bring to this legislation; there are some aspects of it that do concern us.</para>
</talk.start>
<para>However, the purpose of this bill is to establish the fund and to provide it with funding from a number of sources, including the sale proceeds of Telstra. That in itself leads to questions about what moneys will be going into the Future Fund from the sale proceeds of Telstra and how certain governance issues that I will get to a little later will be exercised.</para>
<para>I wish to deal with a number of aspects of the Future Fund Bill. I will focus on what we regard as some serious weaknesses in the approach taken by the government, particularly in governance matters and the general efficiency of establishing a separate fund. We believe that the rationale for those two principles is questionable.</para>
<para>The public sector superannuation liabilities that the government is seeking to offset are finite because most of the relevant schemes and those that contain the greatest liabilities have been closed. These are the defined benefit schemes, the main public sector schemes—the PSS and the CSS—and also the Parliamentary Superannuation Fund. There are, however, a number of still open defined benefit funds or schemes—those that relate to the military, the Governor-General and judges. They will continue to accrue increasing liabilities.</para>
<para>If we look at the current pay-as-you-go basis for our public sector superannuation liabilities, we see that they are not a significant burden on the budget. They are well managed and they are well contained as a cost. There has been no particular difficulty in meeting those expenditures on a pay-as-you-go basis. At the present time they amount to approximately $4 billion per annum. That is a couple of per cent of total budget outlays. That $4 billion is likely to increase at its maximum and peak at a figure of approximately $7 billion. It may perhaps reach some 3½ per cent of total budget outlays. So it is a relatively small proportion of the total budget. As I said earlier, if we follow the logic of creating a fund to cover public sector super liabilities, presumably the same logic would be that you would establish a fund to meet what is effectively a defined benefit fund for the payment of age pension liabilities. But we are not proposing to do that.</para>
<para>What is being created is, over time, a very large, stand-alone and supposedly independent investment fund in order to provide for the payment of these liabilities. It is an investment fund separate from the funds that contain the public sector super liabilities themselves. In many respects it is the equivalent of an individual establishing a separate bank account with a large capital sum in order to use the interest that is earned year on year from that bank account to pay for, for example, their council rates or a significant ongoing liability that they know they are going to continuously receive. Council rates for an individual or a family are a significant impost. They can often cause difficulty with budgeting when they arrive. Sometimes people pay them quarterly; sometimes they pay them half-yearly or yearly. They do create difficulties for some people. Ultimately, it is not really sensible for people to set up separate bank accounts to earn interest in order to cover what will be an ongoing liability over 20, 30 or 40 years in respect of substantial areas of expenditure. But that is effectively what the government is doing here in seeking to cover a liability in this way.</para>
<para>The setting-up of a separate fund does involve an operational cost, approximately $30 million a year, and we will get those final figures once the fund is up and running. It is an estimated $30 million a year to establish a separate fund when in fact the public sector superannuation funds that contain the liabilities also contain some assets. It poses the fundamental question: why aren’t the moneys being placed in the superannuation fund structures themselves? It would be a far more efficient way and, I would argue, a much safer way in terms of governance to place the funds into the existing public sector superannuation funds. With the creation of a Future Fund, we have got the creation of a new set of management, administration and investment skills, and the costs associated with that, when the investment management skills for the administration of moneys already exist within the current public sector superannuation funds. Nevertheless, the government has determined that it will create a new fund.</para>
<para>In the case of private sector superannuation liabilities, in this country the law requires full funding. An employer must place sufficient assets in the fund and, if there is a shortfall for whatever reason, the employer must correct that shortfall over time. The liability on the employer in the private sector to meet those payments and to meet the funding is not different in concept from what is being proposed by the government with its Future Fund. If in the private sector the law requires funding and the placement of the assets into the superannuation funds structure itself, why are we doing something different with the Future Fund?</para>
<para>The other advantage in placing the moneys within the trust structure of the existing public sector superannuation funds is that the governance arrangements are much stronger and much clearer. If the assets were placed in the existing superannuation funds, they would be covered by superannuation trust law. I would argue that, in terms of governance and preventing a future government—particularly the National Party—diverting moneys from what will be a newly established Future Fund, it would be extraordinarily difficult. It would be much more difficult to do it from an established superannuation funds structure. There would be such an outcry about taking moneys that have been deposited into a superannuation fund that it would be very difficult indeed to do. But a Future Fund, a separate fund, does make it more open to the possibility that we will have the National Party—and some of them at least, except for Senator McGauran, are socialists a hundred kilometres outside the GPO—wanting to dabble in all sorts of particular adventures, and this sort of fund and the governance that is being proposed does not preclude a party like the National Party dabbling in its favourite ventures in rural and regional Australia, using some of the proceeds.</para>
<para>We think it is a questionable approach in terms of the establishment of a new structure which will cost moneys to establish and to service ongoing management when we already have those structures in place doing a perfectly satisfactory job. Even the government, when I raised this issue with Senator Minchin in estimates, acknowledged that the current public sector superannuation fund trustees do a first-class job of administering some $10 billion plus in assets already. They get a very good rate of return with very low management fee costs. Again, it begs the question: why do we need to establish a separate fund?</para>
<para>The Minister for Finance and Administration, Senator Minchin, has argued that there is a conflict of interest between investing money on behalf of individual fund members with their money in a superannuation fund and investing on behalf of government with funds that will ultimately be appropriated for those individuals. That is just totally wrong. That is what a fully funded private sector superannuation fund does at the moment. It takes the money from the individuals and the employer—in this case, the Commonwealth government, if that is the approach—and it manages both groups of money, which are in fact held in trust as an asset to be accessed by the member of the fund, in this case in the form of a pension and/or some lump sum access when the individual reaches the access age.</para>
<para>So the government has a very technical view of this Future Fund and its basis. The government applies full funding requirements to private sector superannuation funds—defined benefit funds. It applies those laws rightly, in my view, very vigorously. The regulator, APRA, ensures full funding through an appropriate trustee, management and investment regime. If the government is applying that principle to itself, why doesn’t it deposit the money into existing superannuation funds?</para>
<para>Then there is the issue of the Telstra proceeds should the Telstra sale proceed. Despite this parliament having authorised the sale of Telstra, the government keeps making the point that it may not yet sell it. There are a number of complex reasons why it cannot sell Telstra or announce a sale date. Basically, the price of the shares has crashed. There are a lot of issues around that—the government’s mishandling of the proposal to sell Telstra not the least of them. The government cannot be sure that it will attract a decent price for the sale of Telstra. We have both the Treasurer and the finance minister, Senator Minchin, arguing an option at this stage that the entire proceeds of Telstra, whatever the value, may be shifted into the Future Fund.</para>
<para>If that occurs, the end result, whether it is just over 50 per cent or some lesser proportion—let us say it is 20 per cent if the government can sell off 30 per cent at a reasonable price—is that we will have a Future Fund overweighted in Telstra shares. That is not a balanced fund to give you a maximum rate of return. It leads to a series of practical issues—about which Telstra itself is concerned—about the Future Fund selling large parcels of Telstra, as it would need to do over time. That will impact on the Telstra share price. So there is a question about what the government will receive in Telstra sale share proceeds if it sells part or all of it and whether it will transfer it into the Future Fund. It also raises an important question of governance. How would the Future Fund exercise the voting rights that come with the shares that are placed in the Future Fund? There are a range of governance difficulties around that.</para>
<para>One of the interesting aspects of the Future Fund is that the government’s projected earning rate is very conservative. I think it is the current long-term bond market rate. I am not sure what that precise figure is, but it is a conservative figure. There would be no sense in setting up a Future Fund unless the long-term real rate of return was going to be higher than the bond rate of return. I think that is what will happen. I think the long-term rate of return will be higher than the bond rate. Looking at long-term balanced investment funds historically indicates that a maximising rate of return commensurate with safety, which is what I think the Future Fund would do, will be higher.</para>
<para>That poses an interesting question: what happens to the actuarial calculated surplus that I believe will exist at points in time? What happens when the government receives the actuarial report that shows the fund is surplus to requirements? What happens to that surplus? Does it remain in the fund and effectively the asset to meet liabilities is accrued at an earlier date?</para>

</talk.start>
</continue>
<para>I also want to address this issue in the broader policy context of the impact of the ageing population on the budget. It seems to me that the government is trying to walk both sides of the street in this debate. On the one hand, you have the Treasurer, Mr Costello, talking about the ageing population, the <inline font-style="italic">Intergenerational report</inline> and the need to ensure sustainable finances in respect of a range of policy long-term cost pressures as a consequence of the ageing population. On the other hand, the government has initiated a number of policies—and time does not allow me to go into any great detail today—which, because of the ageing population, will actually significantly increase liabilities in a number of expenditure areas, particularly in areas like health. So, on the one hand, it claims fiscal rectitude, long-term planning, responsibility and care about the ageing population and cost; and, on the other hand, in a number of policy areas on the expenditure side it has been increasing those costs—costs that will increase exponentially.</para>
<para>The Future Fund as outlined in this particular bill is not what was announced. There are a number of issues that go to allowing direct ministerial intervention—ministerial powers of direction that are allowed in respect of the Future Fund and that may expose the fund to political interference and undercut the investment performance of the fund. We do not believe that it is appropriate that ministers should be able to issue powers of direction. In this case the trustees are called guardians. In effect, there is no difference between a guardian and a trustee. Apparently, the term ‘guardian’ is the personal terminology creation of the Treasurer. We know that much from Senator Minchin’s comments in estimates. We do not believe it appropriate that ministers, in this case the Treasurer and the Minister for Finance and Administration, should have powers of direction over the guardians or trustees. If the sole purpose is to maximise a rate of return commensurate with safety and to build up a fund to cover public sector super liabilities, ministers of the day should not have the power to direct and influence investment.</para>
<para>If it were a Labor government proposing something like this, we would be accused of socialising the entire Australian economy—having Labor ministers in there with powers to direct and own every conceivable part of the Australian economy. Just imagine the hysteria of the Liberal Party criticising a Labor government with such powers. I move:</para>

<para>—The <inline ref="R2492">Future Fund Bill 2005</inline> proposes establishing a financial asset fund to meet the Commonwealth’s current and projected future unfunded public sector superannuation obligations. This bill has the potential for a substantial long-term impact on the way the government manages its budget surpluses and asset sales proceeds. It might also have a significant accompanying impact on the way capital markets operate.</para>
</talk.start>
<para>The purpose of this bill is to establish a financial asset fund to meet the Commonwealth’s current and projected future unfunded public sector superannuation obligations. That current liability stands at about $90 billion and is projected to grow to about $140 billion by 2020. This bill proposes the establishment of the Future Fund, the Future Fund Board of Guardians and the Future Fund Management Agency. Critical issues to consider include the quantum of funds that are projected to be under management, transparency, board accountability and adequate and accurate reporting. These are all critical factors. A number of issues arise right up front that relate to the exercise of shareholder ownership voting rights. How will the Future Fund Board of Guardians exercise the voting rights of the financial assets under their control? Will there be a flow-through of proxies from fund managers to the Future Fund? Who will determine the voting pattern of the board on key investment matters, and against what criteria? And will it be politically influenced in any way in the future?</para>
<para>Ethical, socially responsible and so-called green investment policies are not discussed in the bill. Whilst there is merit in reserving investment decisions for the board, consideration should be given to limiting the investment in certain classes of financial assets such as tobacco. After all, this is a public sector body being set up in the national interest and it should be paying attention to issues such as those. Considering the importance of the decisions required in passing this bill, I note that the Senate wisely referred the bill to the Senate Economics Legislation Committee, which duly reported its findings yesterday following a somewhat rushed inquiry.</para>
<para>Whilst it is the decision of the committee that the bill be passed, with some suggested areas of concern noted for government consideration, I still have a number of concerns about the Future Fund that I wish to raise in the Senate today. Some of the concerns pertain to the merit of the Future Fund as a concept and, assuming the concept is realised, how it can be implemented to ensure that principles such as accountability, independence, transparency and propriety are upheld. There are indeed questions as to why the existing mechanisms for dealing with public sector superannuation funds have not been retained and why it is not possible to improve or increase the funding in those funds in a manner similar to those taken up by the states and territories. I refer you to appendix 3 of the report, where there is a useful table showing how the states and territories have addressed that matter, and none have adopted a legislative framework as is proposed here.</para>
<para>With regard to the merit of the Future Fund, one cannot ignore the scale of unfunded public sector superannuation. The Commonwealth’s unfunded public sector superannuation liability currently stands at approximately $90 billion, growing to approximately $140 billion by 2020—big bickies in anybody’s language. The government asserts that this is the single largest determinable forward liability and, as such, the purpose of the Future Fund is to make provision for more effective management of the Commonwealth’s balance sheet. The Future Fund is indeed one means of managing this liability, but it is not the only means.</para>
<para>The current method of funding the annual portion of the liability out of current revenue could certainly continue. The government’s argument against this alternative is that the liability will impinge upon the financial strength of future generations, yet there are two arguments that dispute this opinion. Firstly, the 2002 <inline font-style="italic">Intergenerational report</inline>—an excellent initiative by the Treasurer—asserts that unfunded government superannuation will fall, in fact halve, from 0.6 per cent of GDP in 2001-02 to 0.3 per cent in 2041-42, through the natural process of attrition in member numbers. A similar argument was presented to the committee by the expert witness Mr Kennedy and by the ACCI. Mr Kennedy stated that superannuation liabilities would level out in the future due to the falling number of members drawing down on unfunded superannuation commitments and that this liability is relatively insignificant compared with other unfunded and growing forward liabilities such as social welfare, including age pensions. However, it is asserted that future social welfare cannot be reliably measured and, as such, is not recognised as a liability for balance sheet purposes. From a commonsense perspective, as opposed to a technical perspective, that is a poor argument as it is certainly possible to credibly estimate future welfare obligations.</para>
<para>Regarding the accounting principle of a defined liability, from a balance sheet accounting perspective the recognition principle means that a liability is recognised—and, as the government asserts, is determinable—only once it can be reliably measured and is a probable future expense. Problems with measurement and timing do not mean that such unfunded obligations are not going to occur—there is simply greater uncertainty about questions of how much and when. Thus it is wise to not stick one’s head in the sand but, rather, acknowledge that, yes, there is consensus that social welfare, including age pension obligations, rather than unfunded public sector superannuation is the single greatest financial obligation facing future Australian generations; and, yes, while there is uncertainty about the quantum and timing of such obligations, they will still be very large.</para>
<para>More importantly, diverting public money to the Future Fund to ease the financial pressure of future generations is erroneous in the sense that there is a need to recognise the opportunity cost of an investment in the Future Fund because there will be less investment available in areas such as health, the environment, infrastructure, tax reform and social welfare. Those areas of reform would also benefit future generations and ease their financial burden. Indeed, such investments have the added benefit of boosting productivity and stimulating the economy, unlike the priority of a Future Fund which is to merely meet a future expense. Of course, I recognise that there is an indirect intention, because if you invest in the Future Fund you invest in the capital markets, and capital markets invest in productive activities. So you cannot completely discount the beneficial effects of that investment. Prioritising unfunded public sector superannuation, a defined liability with an extant method of funding, is equivalent to avoiding other undefined but equally pressing reform options—options with far better future economic and social outcomes.</para>
<para>The ACCI is correct in asserting that there is an opportunity cost associated with placing the money in the Future Fund when there are alternative present uses for it. The government responds with the view that the Future Fund is an ‘ex-post’ fund—that is, a fund which receives contributions only after all other investment decisions have been made. In other words, it is a genuine surplus after you have completed your budgetary intentions. But this is a notional assurance. It offers no protection for alternative investments or budget decisions of either a current or capital nature, since such alternatives can be easily avoided through policy setting and prioritising. Otherwise stated, an ‘ex-post’ fund can receive the entire surplus if no other investment decisions are made or if such decisions are not a priority for the government of the day. Indeed, the long-term perspective raises other worrying concerns, as suggested by Mr Kennedy at the inquiry into this bill. He stated:</para>
<quote>
<para>In being created as such a long-term strategy, the Future Fund would inevitably find itself under the stewardship of different future governments and parliaments with, perhaps, a vastly different make-up to what we have come to expect, and for whom the policy agenda, and associated political and fiscal priorities, may profoundly differ from the present.</para>
</quote>
<para class="block">The inquiry did agree that it is not possible to completely insulate the Future Fund and that future governments will be able to change the law regardless of what are seen to be the prudential underpinnings of the bill. Thus, this is an obvious risk that arises from this form of financial planning undertaken by the government. It is important to recognise that it is a greater risk than the existing manner in which superannuation is managed.</para>
<para>If, as is obviously likely, the Future Fund becomes a reality—because the government has the numbers and, anyway, there is support from the opposition for this concept—the relevant question to ask is: what steps should be implemented to ensure the highest fiduciary standards apply to the management and stewardship of the fund? Considering the quantum of funds that are projected to be under management, from the Democrats’ perspective, corporate governance, transparency, independence, board accountability and adequate and accurate reporting are critical factors that must be instituted if the fund is to be successful. Furthermore, they must be monitored and they must be responded to if they are inadequate.</para>
<para>Key priorities in this area include a well-defined code of conduct for the board of guardians, including transparent processes, appointments on merit and well-defined conflict of interest safeguards. On the investment mandate side of things, there must be an ethical investment policy, a high level of independent professional analysis and the diligent exercise of voting on important matters.</para>
<para>I was pleased to note the suggestion from Mr Sandy Easterbrook of Corporate Governance International that the Future Fund provides a major opportunity to be a market leader in terms of best practice voting policy and engagement with companies in which a shareholding is held. The government should not resile from that obligation to be a leader in modern, accountable, ethical and advanced market participation by investment funds. As I have already stated, these are crucial areas from the Democrats’ perspective. Mr Easterbrook stated:</para>
<quote>
<para class="block">It is now accepted that best practice is that funds should vote their shares in all cases and should make sure that their voting is well considered.</para>
</quote>
<para class="block">I concur with the ideal of voting occurring in all cases, and I would encourage the government to adopt this practice as a matter of principle for the Future Fund. However, I recognise that investment managers are not always equipped to vote on all matters and they need to develop the abilities to do so. So my amendment, which will be put out later, only mandates voting in three key areas.</para>
<para>As I said earlier, there are questions relating to voting that need to be answered. They need to be determined in the founding principles and obligations that are applied to the board of guardians, and not later on. The government must put down its expectations. It must say how the Future Fund Board of Guardians will exercise, in general, the voting rights of the financial assets under their control. They must not have a hands-off approach to voting, in my view. It must indicate that there should be a flow-through of proxies and that proxies should be exercised. It should ask the board to be specific as to how they determine their votes. And, of course, the government must put in as many protections as it can to prevent or limit future political interference in the way in which the funds are employed.</para>
<para>The OECD principles of corporate governance, which were put out in January 2004, say the following concerning disclosure of voting:</para>
<quote>
<para>The exercise of ownership rights by all shareholders, including institutional investors, should be facilitated.</para>
<para>Institutional investors acting in a fiduciary capacity should disclose their overall corporate governance and voting policies with respect to their investments, including the procedures that they have in place for deciding on the use of their voting rights.</para>
</quote>
<para class="block">That is a very strong injunction for these sorts of funds not only to be participants in the market process but to be very clear, transparent and public about what their policy is. The OECD principles also state:</para>
<quote>
<para class="block">The voting record of such investors should also be disclosed to the market on an annual basis.</para>
</quote>
<para class="block">The Democrats believe that the trustees and managers of superannuation funds and managed investment schemes have a fiduciary duty to act in the best interests of their members and beneficiaries. We believe that a trustee can only satisfy their fiduciary obligations by taking an active interest in material corporate governance activities of their equity investments. That active interest requires them to develop an informed and professional understanding of these matters. Material corporate governance activities would include voting on three key matters, and in our view these are the three that matter most: on any constitutional issue—in other words, any change to the constitution of a company; on any decision affecting the election of directors; and on the remuneration packages of directors.</para>
<para>We note that Mr Easterbrook of Corporate Governance International goes further, but we believe that at least voting on these three matters should be mandatory. The Democrats will attempt to amend the legislation to extend the requirement to vote on material corporate governance resolutions to the Future Fund managers. Responses from Treasury and the Department of Finance and Administration about the exercise of voting rights for the Future Fund were decidedly and deliberately vague. Clause 24 of the bill was referred to as a suitable guiding principle ‘in a broad sense’. It is not. It is an invitation to a laissez-faire approach, it is an invitation to a hands-off approach, and in my view it is a derogation of responsibility. To put it frankly, the government need to set founding principles which clearly establish issues of public and national interest leadership in ethical corporate and investment governance. They clearly need to spell out—and they have the ability to do so—what they expect from that board.</para>
<para>Corporate governance and investment principles are not about broad and vague policies. They are about specificity, what can be done and what cannot be done—and in making those remarks I refer you to books such as the <inline font-style="italic">Blue Book: Corporate governance—A guide for fund managers and corporations</inline>, issued by the Investment and Financial Services Association Ltd, which are clear attempts to be specific about these matters. A broad, vague reference to what may or may not apply, conditional upon this or that, merely has the opposite effect of reducing transparency, crippling corporate governance structures and reducing responsible market behaviour.</para>
<para>Appointments on merit are another longstanding Democrat initiative that we continue to pursue and which have direct applicability to the Future Fund Board of Guardians. Wherever appointments are made to institutions set up by legislation, independent statutory authorities or quasi-government agencies, the processes by which these appointments are made should be transparent, accountable, open and honest. It is still the case that appointments to statutory authorities are left largely to the discretion of ministers with the relevant portfolio responsibility. There is no umbrella legislation that sets out a standard procedure regulating the procedures for the making of appointments. Perhaps most importantly, there is no external scrutiny by an independent body of the procedure and merits of appointments. An independent body should be given the responsibility of scrutinising government appointments against a set of established criteria.</para>
<para>This system works well in the United Kingdom since the 1995 Nolan commission. Lord Nolan managed to persuade the UK government to accept that appointments should be based on merit. Lord Nolan set out key principles to guide and inform the making of such appointments. These include: a minister should not be involved in an appointment where he or she has a financial or personal interest; ministers must act within the law, including the safeguards against discrimination on grounds of gender or race; all public appointments should be governed by the overriding principle of appointment on merit, except in limited circumstances; political affiliation should not be a criterion for appointment; selections on merit should take account of the need to appoint boards that include a balance of skills and backgrounds; the basis on which members are appointed and how they are expected to fulfil their roles should be explicit; and the range of skills and backgrounds that are sought should be clearly specified.</para>
<para>In response to the Nolan committee’s recommendations, the United Kingdom government subsequently created the Office of the Commissioner for Public Appointments, which has a similar level of independence from the government as the Australian Auditor-General, to provide an effective avenue of external scrutiny. The Democrats have used the Nolan committee’s recommendations in our persistent campaign for appointments on merit amendments in various items of legislation because they are tried and tested. Meritorious appointments are the essence of accountability. We will move appointment on merit amendments to this bill, even though we know that this government will reject, probably for the 30th time, the idea of appointments on merit.</para>

<para>—I rise today to add my support to the government’s <inline ref="R2492">Future Fund Bill 2005</inline>. This bill is a very positive initiative to minimise future impacts brought about by past unfunded superannuation obligations on the Commonwealth. For years, legitimate criticism has been levelled at various governments about the size of this unfunded liability. Over past years, we have seen most state governments, in one way or another, move to fund their superannuation liabilities. The Commonwealth has indeed been a leader, particularly under this coalition government, because it has shifted from what is known as a defined benefits system to a defined contributions system. Nevertheless, we are left with the legacy of legal liabilities in respect of superannuation from the build-up in past years.</para>
</talk.start>
<para>There are a range of reasons why dealing with this unfunded liability now is important, not least of which is the equity issue inherent in any intergenerational transfer of wealth or liabilities. Why should future generations unnecessarily pay for the largesse of former generations? Currently, we all know that, because of the good government of this country, Australia is enjoying a remarkable period of strong economic health and growth. So during this time the Howard government has very astutely retired something like $97 billion of government debt, largely from the sale of assets, and has conscientiously kept the Commonwealth budget in surplus. I regret that this is not a practice that is currently being followed by all state governments, despite the large amount of GST revenue building up their revenue base.</para>
<para>The Future Fund Bill will continue that tradition of leaving our future generations in the strongest possible position, and I therefore endorse it. We have no guarantee that future generations will necessarily enjoy the same benefits that we do now, particularly if we are headed by a different government to the one currently leading this nation. Indeed, with our ageing population, it is almost certain that there will be problems in the future. Therefore, it is prudent to ensure that the debts accrued by today’s generation, and past generations, are paid for by today’s generation.</para>
<para>Submissions to the committee inquiry outlined a number of concerns about the Future Fund Bill, not the least of which being that the Future Fund will be used as a hollow log. This concern is a flipside of the equity issue that I raised earlier, as we do not intend the Future Fund to be used as some form of piggybank to be raided on a rainy day and used for all manner of purposes. While this is a valid concern, it is a concern that the bill attempts to address. The bill implements a number of safeguards on the manner in which moneys can be released from the fund and ensures that the fund will not be used for non-superannuation purposes.</para>
<para>There is a big difference between the Howard government and the ALP. What do we find with the ALP? The ALP produced a second reading amendment which shows them in their true colours. While the government has legislatively attempted to ensure that the moneys set aside and built up by the accumulated revenue within the Future Fund are not used for purposes other than superannuation, the ALP have no such intention. They take an entirely different view, and we see this quite openly and opaquely in Senator Sherry’s second reading amendment. The second reading amendment says:</para>

<para>—They say, ‘Shock, horror!’ It is indeed shock, horror—and I think I have a responsibility during this debate to outline the subterfuge of the Labor Party. While supporting this, they take a hollow log type approach to it. I think that needs to be said.</para>
</talk.start>
</continue>
<para>Another concern has been expressed by some that the money should be spent on tax cuts, infrastructure and any number of other good projects and agendas. The obvious reply here is that it is possible to address the sleeping bear issue of unfunded superannuation liabilities and at the same time implement tax cuts—and I am confident that, in the coming budget in May this year, we will see reforms in this area. In some ways, tax cuts are a bottomless pit and can exacerbate the intergenerational transfer of wealth problem which I mentioned earlier. Putting off to tomorrow what you can do today is never good policy and could well be disastrous as the Commonwealth gathers more and more obligations with fewer taxpayers well into the future because of our ageing population.</para>
<para>On a more positive note, the previous action of eliminating the old defined benefit system plus the increasing value for public servants from the growing accumulation funds will mean that the Commonwealth superannuation obligations will peak and then fall as a percentage of GDP over coming decades. These reforms will further assist in softening the cash flow of future superannuation payouts and the general growth in accumulated funds nationwide will soften the blow of the aged pensions needed for our expanding number of retiring Australians.</para>
<para>The current liability for unfunded superannuation is something of the order of $90 billion. Some have criticised the need for the Future Fund, saying that the discharge of the unfunded superannuation—met on an annual basis by payments from consolidated revenue as the legal payments become due—represents only a small percentage of GDP. While this percentage argument might be true, it does not mean that the Future Fund should not be established. I believe that the challenge for the board will be to keep administrative and operational costs down, achieve their benchmark return rates and efficiently and effectively discharge their obligations to Australian taxpayers.</para>
<para>I believe there could be a number of minor refinements to the bill—and I am sure that the government will take my points on board. With respect to the manner in which the board members are appointed, I would like to see a more formal system put in place—a system which shows a degree of openness and transparent scrutiny of all the candidates to ascertain the merit of their appointment and independence. I believe this is important for two reasons: firstly, to ensure that all board members are eminently qualified and able to carry out their duties—$18 billion of taxpayers’ money deserves capable overseers; and, secondly, to restore and maintain public confidence in the way taxpayers’ money is handled, particularly by people outside the parliament.</para>
<para>I have also looked at the issue of the ownership of Telstra shares and how this transfer should be handled, because this can have ownership implications for Telstra as well as some taxation implications. In fact, I think Telstra is somewhat justified in calling for some notification of when the government intends to transfer Telstra shares to the Future Fund. That said, I believe that the time frame of 60 days requested by Telstra is far too generous. Telstra needs to get its act together. Perhaps a fortnight would be a more appropriate time frame than what Telstra has submitted.</para>
<para>Telstra initially had some concerns regarding the potential tax implications of a transfer of Telstra shares to the Future Fund. Central to Telstra’s concern is the interpretation of section 8AYD of the Telstra Corporation Act 1991. We have been advised by the Department of Finance and Administration that the intention of this section was to remove certain powers that the Commonwealth currently has due to its controlling interest in Telstra. It was not intended, according to the Department of Finance and Administration, to have any application to determining the ownership of the company for taxation purposes. The Department of Finance and Administration then went on to say that the department is working constructively with Telstra on this matter and that currently the department is optimistic that any issues are capable of being resolved administratively and, at the same time, is not convinced of the need for any change to either the Future Fund Bill 2005 or the Telstra act, as suggested by Telstra in its submission and in a number of press releases. The Senate economics report addresses both these issues quite satisfactorily.</para>
<para>To conclude, the Future Fund Bill is a very prudent piece of economic management ensuring that we as a generation meet our obligations, particularly in circumstances of strong and significant budget surpluses. I strongly urge my fellow senators to give their support to the bill without the Labor Party’s atrocious amendment.</para>

<para>—Like Senator Watson, I rise to commend the government for this far-sighted and important step in securing the future of Australia’s fiscal and economic stability. Also—on a more personal level, in a sense—I commend the government for having the foresight to provide for the superannuation requirements of many of my constituents, who obviously will benefit more directly from provisions of this kind, which provide for the future retirement needs of Commonwealth public servants. Of course, these funds will also be available to secure the retirement incomes of members of the federal parliament, but that is a matter I note only as a small aside.</para>
</talk.start>
<para>The fact is that a measure of this kind is extremely important and makes an important provision for the capacity of the next couple of generations of Australians to meet not only their obligations to their community but also those of the previous generation of public servants who reach retirement age. Why do we need to do this? Very simply, the Commonwealth’s unfunded superannuation liability at this moment stands at about $90 billion. That is an enormous amount of money, approaching half of the total annual expenditure of the Commonwealth in any given year. By 2020, less than 15 years from now, that figure will reach $140 billion, approximately two-thirds of today’s annual Commonwealth expenditure.</para>
<para>So to ignore the implications of these facts or to suggest that somehow those who are making public policy in 2020 will be able to cover that kind of liability is laissez-faire nonchalance. It is bad governance, it is foolish and it is grossly unfair to the next generation of Australian taxpayers. I am proud to say that the Australian government has seen that need and has seen that a fund of this kind is important to guarantee intergenerational equity and also to ensure that Australia is able to continue to project a strong sense of economic and fiscal responsibility in its management of its obligations to both public servants and, in particular, people such as members of the Australian Defence Force.</para>
<para>Financial security is an essential part of human security. I am happy to say that the government is taking steps to secure the retirement funds of young men and women who are serving Australia’s interests today in difficult and dangerous conditions around the world. It may be unsexy, it may be even a little boring, to put so much money away into a fund of this kind to cover the superannuation payments required for current public servants. But it is a responsibility that we all bear. If we do not make provision for that obligation we run the serious risk that, at that point in the future, either those liabilities will not be met or, perhaps slightly more likely, they will be met but at a great cost to the capacity of the next generation of Australian taxpayers to fund other important social objectives.</para>
<para>I mentioned a moment ago the issue of fairness. Australia is getting older. I read in the newspaper that we are getting a little bit fatter as well. Perhaps we are getting a little bit wiser. But, whatever the concomitant conditions, we are definitely getting older.</para>

<para>—Indeed—I take what I can get, Senator Sherry. But we are failing in our responsibilities if we do not anticipate the challenges that such ageing and gentrification will bring. As I said, by 2020 our liabilities will have reached $140 billion. With this measure the government is putting aside an initial payment of $18 billion. I think that guarantees that the fund is well on its way towards providing for the obligations the Australian community has to meet at that future point.</para>
</talk.start>
</continue>
<para>I note the range of views which have been expressed by the Australian Labor Party about the idea of a future fund. I cannot honestly say that I can detect a single view—‘a range of views’ is the kindest description I can use with respect to their position. They have argued that perhaps we are putting this money into the wrong kind of chest. They have suggested at other stages that the fund is open to some form of manipulation. I note that on 10 May last year, just after the federal budget, the shadow Treasurer, Mr Swan, said that the Labor Party would support a future fund—thank you for the vote of confidence, Mr Swan—as long as it was locked away in a locked box and could not be raided by the National Party. That is an interesting comment, which contrasts in many respects with the comments made by Mr Beazley, the Leader of the Opposition. Mr Beazley said that he wanted a fund which, far from being locked away, was accessible for the purposes, as he put it, of laying the foundation for higher growth rates. He went on to say that ‘higher productivity and higher growth are the best and only ways to lay a strong foundation for the future’.</para>
<para>I further contrast those views with those of the Labor member for Fraser, Mr McMullan, who was at a budget breakfast the day after the budget. He praised the concept of a future fund, but suggested that more infrastructure work should be funded from that kind of measure. I think it is fair to say that Mr Beazley has a point in saying that investing in Australia’s infrastructure, if that is what he intends, and other measures to produce higher productivity and higher growth are good things and lay a strong foundation, as he suggests, for the future. But there is an essential ingredient that would link such a concept back to the concept of providing for the future liabilities of the Commonwealth with respect to superannuation. That is, you use the benefits of higher productivity and higher growth—meaning more revenue collected by the Commonwealth—to put money aside for just that purpose, without assuming that the higher growth and higher productivity will lead to the extra dollars being available at the point in time when you are going to have to spend it on meeting your obligations to public servants.</para>
<para>The fact is that that need and opportunity will not necessarily coincide. More importantly, the Australian Labor Party has shown very little capacity when the times are good to put away dollars for these sorts of purposes. We had, during the 13 years of Labor government between 1983 and 1996, a number of years when the Australian economy experienced quite satisfactory and good periods of growth. We also had some periods of recession; we all recall Mr Keating’s comments about the recession we had to have. But there were periods of growth. And what happened to the Commonwealth’s capacity at that time to meet these sorts of obligations? It was going backwards. We came to office in 1996 with, as Senator Watson has observed, debts of almost $100 billion. That is testament to how well or poorly the Australian Labor Party takes the trouble to put aside money that it reaps from higher productivity and higher growth. On its track record it cannot be trusted to make those sorts of provisions.</para>
<para>A measure such as a future fund is important to be able to secure those funds that come into the Commonwealth’s hands as a result of, for example, higher productivity and higher growth and put them aside for this very important obligation. The chief executive of the Australian Council for Infrastructure Development, Mr O’Neill, said, in the <inline font-style="italic">Australian Financial Review</inline> on 18 June, that there is no shortage of money for infrastructure developments in Australia at this moment. He makes the very good point that there is a lot of money in the system and that we do not, for the most part, need to divert money of this kind heavily into infrastructure projects that cannot be obtained in the marketplace. It is important, irrespective of what the periodic condition of the market is with respect to funding for infrastructure development, that there be a long-term strategy for securing obligations and liabilities into the future—and there is none bigger than the obligation to the Australian community with regard to superannuation for public servants. There is none larger than that $140 billion we have to find by 2020.</para>
<para>I strongly commend this bill. I note that it is not intended to be part of the current operating accounts of the Commonwealth on a day-to-day basis. It is to be separate. It is to be put aside with very strict rules about how it can be used. It is to be managed accountably and openly. I believe that, in those terms, it will operate very importantly as a bulwark against mismanagement in the future. Whereas I would like to think that the sound economic management which this government offers Australia will continue forever, I acknowledge that that is unlikely and that one day others will be on the Treasury benches. When that happens—hopefully it will not be soon—the Australian community will be grateful for the fact that provision was made through this legislation to put aside funds that otherwise might have been raided for short-term political gain by a government with much less financial prudence than has been shown by the Howard government.</para>

</talker>
<para>—I rise to contribute to this debate on the <inline ref="R2492">Future Fund Bill 2005</inline>, which, as we know, gives effect to the government’s commitment to create a fund to provide for the public sector’s superannuation liabilities. These liabilities are continuing to accrue and will gradually mount over the next 20 or 30 years, with the Commonwealth Superannuation Scheme and the Defence Force Retirement Benefits Scheme currently completely unfunded, and liabilities accruing under the Military Superannuation and Benefits Scheme and the Public Sector Superannuation Scheme only partly funded. Together, these schemes make up 95 per cent of the government’s superannuation liabilities. Payments of the fund will generally not begin until after 2020, although this will depend on financial circumstances leading up to that time. The initial capital for the fund will be a transfer of $18 billion from the RBA, and the government has not committed itself to providing additional funding apart from this amount. As we know, the Future Fund board will be responsible for deciding how to invest those funds.</para>
</talk.start>
<para>Labor have some genuine problems with what we regard as serious weaknesses in the approach being taken by the government, even though we do acknowledge and support the broad concept of the Future Fund. As Senator Sherry has already indicated, the rationale for the legislation itself is highly questionable. Firstly, the public sector superannuation liabilities that the government is seeking to offset are finite, because the relevant schemes have been closed. Secondly, at the moment the percentage of the annual budget of the government that is occupied by public sector superannuation liabilities is still a small proportion of the total budget. This fund will bring an additional cost of $30 million for a separate fund over four years. We have to ask: do we really need this?</para>
<para>The Minister for Finance and Administration, Senator Minchin, has suggested that there was a potential conflict of interest between investing on behalf of individual fund members with their money versus investing on behalf of the government with funds that would ultimately be appropriated to the individuals. Frankly, I am not convinced by that argument. Of course, the Treasurer—and today we have heard the same debate here and the same assertions made—when he announced the Future Fund drew heavily on the <inline font-style="italic">Intergenerational report</inline>, painting a grim picture of the likely impact of the ageing of the population on the federal budget over the next 20, 30 and 40 years, particularly with respect to health expenditure, aged care expenditure and various other items in the budget.</para>
<para>The 2002 <inline font-style="italic">Intergenerational report</inline> provided some pretty frightening projections of the likely impact of the ageing of the population on fiscal balances. The government has used this report to justify so many of its policy pronouncements in recent months: cutting access to the Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme, reducing the number of people on disability support pensions and supporting its broader political agenda. So it suits the government to talk about the ageing of the population and the longer term impact that will have on the nation’s fiscal circumstances. But it also suits the government because this government is rolling out a variety of new entitlements to particular groups—entitlements that will inevitably explode in their burden on the federal budget over time. These are entitlements like the mature age tax offset, the utilities allowance, the capital gains tax exemption for people retiring from small businesses and the superannuation copayment. This is a growing list of entitlements that the Howard government is producing purely for political support and which will be very substantial longer term burdens on the budget, especially once the baby boomers retire.</para>
<para>So the Future Fund is more an investment in the future of the Howard government. It is not an investment in the future of this nation or in the long-term national interest. Labor have a better alternative, and we will harness the fund to meet our long-term challenges while ensuring its absolute independence. We need to think very carefully about the economic prosperity of our nation and the challenges that we face. We have had 14 years of uninterrupted growth, but our future prosperity could well be at risk by many external circumstances. That is not being a naysayer; the Business Council of Australia recently warned that the performance of Australia’s economy is slipping and we are heading for trouble. They disagree with the government on a number of key areas of policy which go to the heart of securing the future prosperity of the nation: the failure of the government to reform the tax system, to put incentives in it and to keep it efficient and fair; the failure to ensure that we are internationally competitive; the regulatory burden, which is a drag on productivity; the failure to invest in the skills and the education of our people; and the failure to deal with the entrenched buck-passing and overregulation which flows from gridlock in federal-state relations. These are all important matters that we need to attend to to protect our prosperity well into the future.</para>
<para>We have the capacity for our future prosperity to create wealth for future generations, but right now that is at risk and the most fundamental thing that as a nation we can and should do is cope with the ageing of our population by creating wealth. First and foremost that is the factor that enables us to deal with the long-term pressures of the ageing of the population. Central to wealth creation, of course, is our productivity and the fact that we must lift our productivity over time.</para>
<para>If we look at what has been happening recently, we see that our productivity has gone into reverse. In 2004-05 labour productivity fell by 1.3 per cent—the first fall since 1986-87, the largest since 1982-83 and only the sixth fall in the last 39 years. It was a broad based fall, with 11 of 14 market sectors recording a decline in productivity. That should set alarm bells ringing for all of us, but it does not seem to have set alarm bells ringing for the government. The government has put all its eggs in the basket of a low-skilled, low-wage path, claiming that its response to declining productivity—a range of industrial relations changes which will eat away at the living standards of many in our workforce—is going to be the magical solution. Everyone in the country agrees that we need a broad based reform program and a vision across a raft of policy areas to deliver the productivity that we require for the future—everyone, it would seem, except the Treasurer and the Prime Minister.</para>
<para>Nothing is more symptomatic of our decline in competitiveness and the decline underneath that in our productivity than our recent trade performance. The Minister for Trade claimed recently in the House of Representatives on the back of one set of figures that somehow the records that have been set with current account deficits in recent times have been dealt with by a slightly improved recent performance. Well, I do not think so. There is a very long way to go if we are to deal with our entrenched problems of competitiveness and their reflection in our current account deficit and escalating net foreign liabilities. We have a long way to go to lift our trade performance from where it is at the moment. While we have a one-off boost to our national economy from record commodity prices, that certainly cannot be guaranteed to be there forever. So the circumstances now are such that we must invest in the future, and this Future Fund is not setting Australia up to do that. This is why so many people hold such deep reservations about it and about the motivation of the government in setting it up in such an inappropriate way.</para>
<para>Our poor performance in ETM exports is well documented, from double-digit growth in the nineties to almost half now being in absolute decline. We are already aware that, since 2000, Australia has actually shed something like 115,000 of our manufacturing workforce jobs. There is certainly a challenge for us there. We know that, as things get tougher, particularly for our manufacturing industry, we need to be looking at the rest of our economy and at how we can improve productivity. We also acknowledge that, if we get the policy settings right in this country, there are great opportunities in that restructuring and in the movement of wealth across the Asia-Pacific. But what we have to do is put in place the policy settings that maximise the opportunities for this country.</para>
<para>If we look at what is going on with service exports, we find there are other great challenges there. Our overall export performance in services is dismal and the challenge to lift its performance is daunting. Our service sector exports are just four per cent of GDP—the third lowest in the OECD and one-third of the OECD average. Just 27 per cent of our service exports lie outside tourism and transport, down from 30 per cent in 2000. Tourism and transport are important, of course, but what about the vast array of other high-skilled, high-value-added services? We need to see that we have an investment in high-end services such as education, financial services, communication, computer services, medical research and software. They are the big challenges that we face as a nation. What is this Future Fund doing to contribute to that?</para>
<para>Most thinking people who have observed our economy over the years recognise that there is a need for a new vision in this community that goes to the heart of lifting our productivity and competitiveness. We are not getting that in the Future Fund Bill. We are getting this very narrow focus based on industrial relations changes and we see this peculiar thing, the Future Fund. We need something much broader than that—something that is crucial to lifting our trade performance, creating wealth, sustaining prosperity and making our economy much more productive across a range of policy areas, with a new range of policy initiatives.</para>
<para>Let us have a look at this Future Fund and how it is going to play its role. It certainly does not actually do anything about lifting productivity or sustaining our prosperity. It does nothing. It is really a solution which is looking for a problem. The problem the government has identified is increasingly underfunded public sector superannuation liabilities. On the face of it, the figures are pretty daunting. We talk about an increase to $140 billion over the next 10 years. But, in fact, that headline number is misleading. What is crucial is not the absolute size of superannuation liabilities but the cost to the budget each year arising from those liabilities. The reality is that the official projections show that the cost to the budget is currently in decline. While the government has refused to release the latest projections, the future call on the budget was further diminished, as I said before, by the closing of the Public Sector Superannuation Scheme on 1 July last year. Public sector superannuation liabilities are a problem that has already been solved with the closure of the fund. It is a big red herring in this whole debate.</para>
<para>Labor’s alternative is a much more sensible one. We believe that the government’s priority should be to secure our future prosperity by lifting the productive potential of the economy as soon as we can to meet the challenge of intensifying competition in our region, to capture a much greater share of the opportunities that are arising from that and to minimise the risk flowing from it. Under Labor, the assets in the government’s Future Fund would be retained in the Building Australia Fund. However, under Labor, the income stream from the fund would be applied to productive purposes, including infrastructure investment, and not set aside solely to offset the cost of bureaucrats’ superannuation payments, which are already in decline.</para>
<para>What we need is some national leadership in infrastructure. It is not just a question of trumping up public funds. We need a completely new national approach to infrastructure which brings the capacity of government, the private sector, state governments, local governments and communities together to meet the challenges across the board and to do something about our ageing infrastructure that is going to lift our productivity. But there is nothing about any of that in this bill.</para>
<para>The Reserve Bank of Australia cautions that capacity constraints in the non-residential construction and resource sector mean that new projects are being put off. Even the Prime Minister’s own hand-picked task force found that there were underlying weaknesses in Australia’s infrastructure which must be addressed to ease capacity constraints and bottlenecks in export industries. A federal Labor government will allow the Future Fund to consider all important investment opportunities suitable to its return and risk objectives, and that would include commercially attractive infrastructure investments. That is an important difference.</para>
<para>But what really disturbs us about this fund, apart from the missed and lost opportunities that it presents, is really the issue of governance. That is what has been discussed here in the chamber today in several of the contributions to the debate. It is worth recalling the government’s promise when the details of the Future Fund were announced in last year’s budget. The government said:</para>
<quote>
<para class="block">The Fund will be managed by an independent statutory board ... in accordance with a broad investment mandate issued by the Treasurer and the Minister for Finance and Administration ... the Board will set the investment strategy and the strategic asset allocation for the Fund ... actual investment management will be contracted out to private sector funds managers ...</para>

<para class="block">In other words, the government will set the risk and return objectives of the fund, an independent board will decide what type of investments will enable them to achieve these objectives and independent fund managers will decide on what specific investments will be purchased. That is what they said then. The Treasurer crowed at the time that the fund would be managed by experts, free from government interference. But that is not the case.</para>
<para>The committee heard in evidence to its inquiry that this certainly is not the case. The bill demonstrates that that is not the government’s intent. The bill shows that the government’s power over the fund will go far beyond the setting of a broad investment mandate. It is intended to empower the government to direct the investments contained in the fund. We had a lot of discussion and speculation about the chief executive officer in a discussion about the probity issues. That was raised again here in the chamber by Senator Watson. It was very concerning to all senators from both sides of the chamber who were involved in the inquiry. The rules that govern the operation of this fund are not what was originally promised by the government and they are not what they should be if this money is going to be locked away for the future, as the government claims.</para>
<para>The fund will not be overseen by trustees, as is the case with every other public sector superannuation fund in the country. There will be no trustees whose independence will be protected by law and who will have the duty to act only in the best interests of the fund when it can be subject to political direction. Instead, the Future Fund will be overseen by so-called guardians who must do what the government tells them, even if, in their professional judgment, it is not in the best interests of the fund. This hardly seems to be good governance to me.</para>
<para>We had a long discussion in the inquiry about the announcement during the summer period about the placing of Telstra sales into the Future Fund and the arrangements that might exist around that proposal. We are very concerned about this. Some interesting scenarios were discussed about falsely inflating the value of the Telstra shareholding to ensure the government’s forward estimate of zero net debt appears achievable. Anything can happen with these arrangements, but the risks go far beyond Telstra. We are genuinely concerned about the government’s power to direct how an additional $18 billion pool of cash is invested.</para>
<para>We talked about the pork-barrelling proclivities of this government, particularly those of The Nationals. We have seen just in recent days how the National Party electorates have been favoured in so many programs of this government. Its track record certainly does not give us any comfort that this money will be used to lift Australia’s productive capacity at all. We know, of course, that it is going to be used to try to lift the Liberal Party’s popularity in marginal electorates. That really is what this is all about. The Future Fund, as we see it here on this side of the chamber, is at risk of being manipulated by a government that is intent on securing its own political mandate for a further decade, heaven forbid. We are very keen to see that some good governance amendments are put to the bill—that is, those being suggested and supported by the Democrats and Senator Sherry on behalf of Labor.</para>

<para>—Before I commence the substance of my remarks on the <inline ref="R2492">Future Fund Bill 2005</inline>, I would like to take a moment to thank my fellow members of the Senate Economics Legislation Committee and the secretariat of that committee. As fellow senators may be aware, the hearings into the Future Fund Bill were held at the same time that the chamber was considering the private member’s bill dealing with RU486. It makes organising representation in both places a little difficult, when one is facing a conscience vote. I particularly want to place on record my thanks to my colleague Senator Stephens for carrying the lion’s share of the workload in that hearing. I would also like to thank the other members of that committee and the secretariat for their forbearance because, when I did manage to get to the hearing halfway through their second day of evidence, I got a crash course on the proposal before us and how the government plans to administer it, and what outside groups think will be the outcome of that. It is important to place on the record their forbearance and tolerance in allowing me to learn a bit more about people’s views.</para>
</talk.start>
<para>As Senator Stephens has said, and Senator Sherry before her, Labor’s major problem with the Future Fund Bill is that the government’s arrangements do not actually meet the government’s 2005 budget commitment. That commitment was, as has been said, that the Future Fund would be managed by an independent statutory board and that the board would be free to set the investment strategy and the strategic asset allocation of the fund. Indeed, while I was at the hearings, that was the main focus of our discussion. Despite having been through that crash course at the economics committee hearings, the Labor members of that committee were not convinced that there was evidence to say that the legislation actually meets the government’s commitment. Hence our additional comments to the committee’s report, which were basically that the Labor Party is of the view that the government’s arrangements for the Future Fund do not meet the 2005 budget commitment that the fund would be managed by an independent statutory board and that the board would be free to set the investment strategy and the strategic asset allocation of the fund, as I have said.</para>
<para>Labor’s concern also is that the Board of Guardians does not have the same legal protections that are afforded to Commonwealth superannuation boards. In addition, the power to direct the board is general in the legislation and goes beyond maximising long-term returns and extends to—and I quote from the bill—‘such other matters as the responsible ministers consider relevant’. This exposes the fund to a higher level of ministerial interference than would be the case if the board’s functions were limited to maximising the return on the fund across a balanced investment portfolio. This legislation, as it currently stands, empowers the ministers concerned to dismiss board members for ‘inadequate performance’. This extraordinary broad and ill-defined power adds to the risk of undue political interference in investment decisions of the fund.</para>
<para>What we have seen, as always with the government, is that their rhetoric in the 2005 budget statement, the rhetoric of the sell of the proposal of the Future Fund, does not meet the reality of delivery when we see the fine print of the legislation. I remind senators that our additional concerns were particularly around the role of the Board of Guardians and the fact that they do not have the same legal protections afforded to those serving on Commonwealth superannuation boards. They are at the beck and call of the political whim of the two ministers concerned. Indeed, to see this you only have to consider clause 18(2) of the bill, which says that the powers of the minister include—and I will say yet again—‘such other matters as the responsible ministers consider relevant’, which is a pretty broadly and ill-defined term.</para>
<para>So much for the independence of the board of the Future Fund. It is, indeed, open to political direction. You cannot go much further along the road to undermine independence as to include a provision in a piece of legislation that covers all other matters that the relevant ministers consider relevant—it is a pretty sweeping statement. Where does that begin or end? How far can the ministers go in forcing the board to consider such other matters as they consider relevant? It is this kind of open-ended provision within the legislation that allows for the worst kind of interference, not the locked box that we were seeking with the Future Fund. If that is not bad enough, you only have to consider that the legislation as it stands also allows the ministers to dismiss board members for inadequate performance, but we have no definition of that in the bill either. So that is another open-ended and ill-defined provision that could give rise to political interference in the investment decisions of the fund.</para>

<para>—My question is to Senator Santoro, the Minister for Ageing. Is the minister aware of fresh allegations on <inline font-style="italic">Lateline</inline> last night of the abuse of frail aged care residents? Didn’t the program note that there is now a third aged care facility in which allegations of abuse are being investigated by police? Can the minister confirm that a resident’s allegations of abuse at this unnamed facility in March of 2005 were dismissed by the provider, with police only being called nine months later when a second resident made similar allegations of abuse? When was the issue brought to the attention of the department and the minister? What action was taken? In addition, didn’t <inline font-style="italic">Lateline</inline> recount an incident in a fourth facility, Millward, in Victoria? What action has the minister taken to investigate the claim that in this facility an elderly female resident with a brain injury was forced to confront the person she alleged had assaulted her? Does the minister still have full confidence in the protection provided to frail elderly residents under the government’s aged care system?</para>

<para>—Thank you to Senator McLucas for her continuing questions. Yes, I did watch <inline font-style="italic">Lateline</inline> last night, after I was notified that there were going to be further revelations in relation to this very sad issue. I must admit that, just like Senator McLucas and anybody else who watched the program, I was quite shocked by some of the allegations that were made. I can assure Senator McLucas that we are acting as quickly as we can to get to the bottom of the allegations that have been made. Undoubtedly, the department and the agency will be in contact again with the various nursing homes and aged care facilities in question. Undoubtedly, they will show great diligence and will investigate the allegations expeditiously.</para>
</talk.start>
<para>In terms of the nursing home that was not named, I cannot say much more than what was on that particular program, other than to ask the department if they can identify the nursing home in question. We will be making contact, if we have not already done so, with <inline font-style="italic">Lateline</inline>, to ask them if they have any information that will identify it. As to the allegation that was aired about the nonreporting of an allegation of abuse, I can say to the senator that that was very disturbing. Those of us who saw the story were all very disturbed, particularly by the allegation that the resident who allegedly had been abused was asked to confront the person who offended.</para>
<para>I say to you again, Senator McLucas, that I am very committed to doing my very best to eradicate these problems. I will continue to do my very best, as I have been doing since I became minister, to look at the way the department operates and to look at the way that the agency operates so that we can improve the system in order to minimise the sort of abuse that has become evident. I say again to the senator that the vast majority of residents within aged care facilities that are funded by the Commonwealth government live in perfect safety and perfect happiness. There are, however, some outrageous instances of abuse. We will be doing our very best to resolve that.</para>
<para>Senator McLucas said that there were four cases. The Senate may wish to be informed that there are over 100,000 aged care residents in aged care homes. I provide that information simply to show the number of cases relative to the number of people who are in aged care facilities—although, as I have said, one case of abuse is one case too many and four cases of abuse are four too many. I again reiterate that I will do my utmost to improve the system so that we can minimise the occurrence of these dastardly deeds.</para>

Aren’t aged care nurses now publicly saying that a system which gives providers notice of inspections can be manipulated by the minority of providers who are not providing proper care?

<para>—My question is to the Minister for Ageing, Senator Santoro. The proper care and humane treatment of older Australians is a key responsibility for all levels of government and, indeed, the wider Australian community. Recent reports of alleged abuse in nursing homes are disturbing for all concerned, particularly the elderly and their families. Would the minister please outline to the Senate what actions he has taken since these reports came to his attention and any future initiatives he might have to support elderly Australians in nursing home care?</para>

<para>—Thank you to Senator Patterson for her question. I recognise her longstanding interest in and commitment to this vital area of public policy. As I indicated to the chamber yesterday, this government has been very proactive in moving to address community concerns about abuse of the elderly in nursing homes. As I have just said in my answer to Senator McLucas’s first question in this place today, I was particularly disturbed to hear that in one nursing home the alleged abuse was not reported immediately to police. This lent some strength to the call for the introduction of some form of mandatory reporting of such incidents. However, before ruling that in or out, as I indicated yesterday and also last week, I intend to consult the Aged Care Advisory Committee on that issue and on a range of other options such as compulsory police checks, whistleblower protection and possible improvements to the complaints resolution scheme. The meeting of the advisory committee, as I have sought to indicate, will take place on Tuesday, 14 March here in Parliament House.</para>

<para>—The committee is well positioned to provide me with the kind of expert advice that I need before deciding how to proceed in relation to these matters. I hear the Leader of the Opposition in the Senate say that it is not a summit and it is not a meeting. For the benefit of the Leader of the Opposition in the Senate and Senator McLucas I would like to outline the membership of that particular committee. It comprises representatives from the following organisations: the Council of the Ageing/National Seniors; the Royal College of Nursing, Australia; Catholic Health Australia; Carers Australia; the Baptist Community Services; the Australian Society for Geriatric Medicine; the Older Women’s Network; the Australian Nursing Federation; the Royal Australian College of General Practitioners; Aged and Community Services Australia; Alzheimer’s Australia; UnitingCare Australia; the Aged Care Association Australia; the Pharmaceutical Society of Australia; the Health Professions Council of Australia; the Australian Medical Association; the Commonwealth Department of Veterans’ Affairs; the Brotherhood of St Laurence; the Aged Care Standards and Accreditation Agency; and the Australian Pensioners and Superannuants League.

<para>Following this meeting, I will be meeting with my state and territory colleagues to discuss a collaborative way forward. I have already received assurances from at least one of my state and territory colleagues that they are keen to participate in this endeavour. In fact, the Minister for Ageing in Victoria made that attitude very clear on <inline font-style="italic">Lateline</inline> last week. Whatever collaborative approaches are determined with my state and territory colleagues, we could never give a 100 per cent assurance—and none of my state parliamentary colleagues who have got responsibilities in the area of ageing will give a 100 per cent assurance—that the incidents that we have been discussing today will never be repeated. But what I can say is that we will do our best, and I will certainly leave no stone unturned in order to improve the system and make sure that these bad deeds do not keep occurring.</para>

<para>—My question is also to Senator Santoro, the Minister for Ageing. My question relates to the response of the minister yesterday in relation to the Immanuel Gardens Nursing Home on the Sunshine Coast. Can the minister now explain why sanctions were only imposed in February 2006 when an inspection found serious breaches of care standards in August 2005? Minister, why that six-month delay? Why wasn’t the provider forced to appoint a nursing adviser in August 2005 when there was clear evidence that residents were not receiving proper care. Didn’t the agency’s report of that time note that the facility has ‘a record of persistent failure to comply with the Accreditation Standards over the last three years’? Why weren’t the residents at this place properly protected?</para>

<para>—I thank Senator Moore for her questions. Since question time yesterday I have sought further advice in relation to the sequence of events that have been mentioned within Senator Moore’s question, and I am able to assist her and the Senate in a very comprehensive way. It is important that the Senate understand the sequence of events related to Immanuel Gardens Nursing Home and the role of agencies within my portfolio in this case.</para>
</talk.start>
<para>In the case of Immanuel Gardens, the recent imposition of sanctions and claims of abuse against residents are two separate matters, and I want to address both of those matters very comprehensively so that there can be no misunderstanding. Sanctions were imposed on Immanuel Gardens in February this year relating strictly to non-compliance matters such as clinical care, infection control, human resource management and pain management stemming from a review audit undertaken by the Aged Care Standards and Accreditation Agency on 11 and 12 August 2005. That particular review audit was ordered after a scheduled support contact on 26 July 2006 found some noncompliance. That was a scheduled audit. This review audit led to the placement of Immanuel Gardens on a timetable for improvement—and I will explain during the course of the answer why a timetable for improvement is important.</para>
<para>As a result of ongoing noncompliance, the department issued a notice of decision to impose sanctions on 6 February this year. The compliance process in this case was managed strictly in accordance with the legislation, the main focus of which is bringing about improvements to care standards for residents. The process here was transparent and accountable. The department instigated the legal compliance process based on the recommendations of the agency. When the home failed to achieve the required improvements within the time frame set, the department did impose sanctions. This is one of the important points that I need to make for the benefit of all senators. It is important to remind them all that the quality framework in aged care is aimed at ensuring the best possible outcome for residents, not punishing providers at the expense of residents’ care. That was a prime objective of the department and of the agency when they adopted the time frame that they did in relation to this issue.</para>
<para>I want to stress something else. I want to say very deliberately that, separate to the sanctions process I have just referred to, Immanuel Gardens stood down an assistant nurse on 10 October 2005 on the same day that the allegations of abuse were made. I fear that as a result of the exchange yesterday there might have been some confusion as to when that person was stood down by the management of the nursing home. I want to stress that that person was stood down on the same day that the allegations were made. The matter was referred to the police, where, as I advised the Senate yesterday, it is the subject of an ongoing investigation. It is terribly important that these two issues are in fact not blurred.</para>
<para>I am serious about bringing positive changes in the aged care sector to increase the protection of elderly and vulnerable residents who are in the care of the aged care system within the states. I am engaging in responsible and extensive consultation with all components of the aged care system in this country, and we will deal with these serious allegations in a measured and constructive way. I will not be bulldozed into knee-jerk reactions and I will not respond to any abuse of the department or myself. These are serious matters that require serious consideration and serious input from the professionals who have the facts and the figures and lifelong experience in this matter, and I intend to conduct myself accordingly.</para>

<para>—I thank Senator Johnston for his question and note his longstanding interest in this issue. Last week I took my first official trip as minister for fisheries to Perth, Broome and Darwin, at the invitation of Barry Haase, David Tollner and coalition senators from Western Australia and the Northern Territory. The purpose of that visit was to discuss firsthand with stakeholders the scourge of illegal fishing. Make no mistake: we are dealing with a scourge which not only threatens the livelihoods of our Australian fishermen but also brings with it the threat of disease and worse being brought to Australia. What this trip did was reinforce for me that we as a government need to take a zero tolerance approach, just like we do with illegal drugs and road deaths. There will always be people who want to steal fish from our well-managed waters and, unless we aim to wipe out the scourge, we will surely fail.</para>

In this regard, last week I met with both the Western Australian and Northern Territory ministers and their opposition counterparts to discuss how we can work together. I can confirm to the Senate that just yesterday my colleague the outstanding Minister for Foreign Affairs, Alexander Downer, met with the Indonesian government to further discuss how our two governments can further work together to fight this scourge with joint patrols.</para>
<para>We also need to make it financially unviable and the risk of capture too high for the illegal fishers who want to ply our waters. As a result, in the short term the government is very focused on increasing the numbers of apprehensions in our northern waters, particularly of the so-called iceboats, which are increasingly acting as mother ships to the smaller bodhis. Over recent weeks, increased efforts from the Navy—and I congratulate Minister Nelson on this—have resulted in some half-dozen iceboats being apprehended and, as a result, a significant drop-off in iceboat incursions. But we do need to do more and I hope to report more to the Senate in due course.</para>
<para>I was asked about alternative policies. I think that there is in general terms cross-party support on this issue that something needs to be done. I suggest to those opposite that simply painting a red line on our Navy or Customs boats will not change anything at all, and just renaming something a ‘Coastguard’ will not provide the solutions. What we need is action, and immediate action—</para>

That is what I dedicate myself to; I invite those opposite to dedicate themselves to that task as well and together we can get rid of this scourge. <inline font-style="italic">(Time expired)</inline>

<para>—My question is to Senator Santoro, the Minister for Ageing. Can the minister confirm that the government has received repeated warnings that the aged care complaints system is not working? Hasn’t the complaints commissioner identified problems with the department’s administration of complaints and the potential for retribution to dissuade residents and families from coming forward? Didn’t the Senate report tabled on 23 June 2005 recommend a series of changes to the complaints scheme to improve its effectiveness and responsiveness? Don’t the recommendations of the Senate report directly address the problems with the system as identified by the families of the alleged abuse victims in a number of current cases? Given that there was not an election last year, as the minister has tried to claim, why didn’t the government urgently respond to these reports? Why did the government wait until cases of serious abuse became public before acting?</para>

<para>—During the 2004-05 reporting period, a total of 621 complaints were finalised and the overall response rate was 49 per cent. In other words, 49 per cent of those surveyed returned the survey forms, which I am sure all reasonable senators would regard as a very high return rate for self-completed surveys. The data shows that, in relation to overall satisfaction with the service provided by the scheme, 86 per cent of complainants who responded expressed satisfaction, six per cent indicated dissatisfaction and eight per cent did not respond. I would suggest to honourable senators opposite that that is a good result for the complaints resolution scheme.</para>

You just cannot convene a high-level, expert committee, made up of busy people like the people representing the organisations that I mentioned, just overnight. Simple courtesy requires that you give them proper notice for them to prepare their thoughts and their submissions—and we have asked them to let us have their thoughts. That is just proper courtesy and proper planning for a serious meeting. There has been no postponement. I made no announcement of any date until we fixed a date.

<para>—I thank Senator Nash for a very important question on something which is vital to all Australians, and that deals with the question of law and order. At the last election we undertook to review penalties in relation to Commonwealth offences. Last week I announced that review and it dovetails with a review undertaken by the Australian Law Reform Commission in relation to sentencing. While I am on my feet, I just want to make a correction. The review that I announced was not necessary because of the Australian Law Reform Commission’s review of sentencing. This is something completely different. It is looking at whether we at the Commonwealth level have in place penalties which meet community expectations.</para>

<para>—I know the opposition are making interjections. They are not interested in what the community thinks. They are not interested in what Australians think about criminal law and condign punishment for people who commit serious offences, but we are and we are carrying out our undertaking at the election to have a look at it.</para>
</talk.start>
</continue>
<para>I can point out that, while states and territories deal with offences largely dealing with the person and property, at the Commonwealth level there are some very serious offences indeed with which we are involved. Of course, we are cracking down on the illegal importation of drugs, people trafficking, sex trafficking and child sex tourism. That might be of some interest to senators opposite, but we are vitally interested in this. I might also point out that, when you look at the penalties that we have in place, it is vitally important that we abide by the undertaking that we gave the Australian people that those penalties will meet community expectations, and that is what this is all about.</para>
<para>I was interested to note that, out of some 691 Commonwealth offenders that we have around the country, over 200 are serving sentences in excess of 10 years imprisonment. In some cases, they are serving life imprisonment with non-parole periods exceeding 20 years for drug trafficking. I think that sends a very clear message in relation to the seriousness with which we attack the trafficking of drugs. Part of this will also assess the adequacy of penalties in relation to corporations. We have heard the opposition talk a great deal about corporate liability, but what we will be looking at is the question of penalties for corporations.</para>

That is something that the states and territories might be refusing to deal with but we at the Commonwealth level are not. That is precisely what this is about.</para>
</talk.start>
</continue>
<para>We are also considering the Law Reform Commission’s inquiry regarding a guide to framing Commonwealth offences, which is dealing with civil and administrative penalties. That, too, feeds into the overall approach that we have regarding the adequacy of laws in relation to criminal jurisdiction at the Commonwealth level. Whilst, as I say, the states and territories deal with offences which largely relate to the person and property, we at the Commonwealth level have a responsibility to make sure that our penalties meet community expectations for serious crimes such as drug trafficking, sex trafficking, child sex tourism, child pornography on the internet, and a range of other very serious offences on which Australians would expect us, as a responsible government, to take appropriate action.

</talker>
<para>—I thank the senator for the question. Some senators may have seen some coverage given to this matter recently, alleging that no money had been paid—not saying by way of compensation, but saying that no money had been paid. Those statements were incorrect. An amount of just under $8,000 had been paid, but that related primarily to travel expenses for legal advice.</para>
</talk.start>
<para>The advice I have in relation to this matter is that Families, Community Services and Indigenous Affairs are dealing with the short-term needs of Ms Rau and that a question in relation to those short-term needs should be directed to that minister. The compensation issue is being dealt with, as is normally the case, by the Australian Government Solicitor. So questions in that regard could go to the Attorney-General but as we are the client they should probably stay with me.</para>
<para>The most recent advice I have on this matter is that parties are looking to get a negotiated settlement of this matter. That will be much quicker than court proceedings and would be, I think, in everybody’s interest. It is not that I am opposed to lawyers but I am sure it will provide less money to the lawyers and be more efficient. However, there are some issues to be resolved before all parties can come to such an agreement. Those issues pertain to whether other parties that might subsequently be pursued would agree, because, if I am properly advised at this point, if we make an agreed settlement and action is then taken against other parties, they may seek to join the Commonwealth, so the Commonwealth would not be finished with the matter. So we are trying to get to a point where all parties can come together, agree and resolve the matter.</para>
<para>It does seem to be taking some time. I have to say that I do not agree with everything that you said, Senator Nettle, in the introduction to your question, but it is quite common for you and I to disagree about what you say, so I do not put too much emphasis on that. But I am sure it is in everybody’s interest, and in particular in Ms Rau’s interest, for this matter to be brought to a final conclusion—not that there is a final conclusion for the Commonwealth and then some other issue is started up. She can then get on with her life and put this matter behind her. She cannot do that until we can get to a negotiated solution that all parties can agree is the solution.</para>

<para>—Sometimes Senator Nettle can’t help herself. The answer was pretty clear: the Commonwealth thinks it is better not to have litigation. Obviously, the Commonwealth thinks it is better not to have litigation. The senator made reference to some time period in relation to Ms Solon. I make the point with respect to Ms Solon that the government very quickly sent a Centrelink social worker to the Philippines. I can see no reason—I could not then and cannot now—why Ms Solon was not brought back to Australia earlier and why we could not then have proceeded to have a negotiated settlement, which is what is under way in relation to that matter. But I think the questions in relation to that are best addressed to her lawyers. At the time they issued a press release saying that I was delaying, when I was in fact not the negotiator—in this case it was Family and Community Services—which indicated to me that they were not quite sure what was going on. <inline font-style="italic">(Time expired)</inline>

<para>—I thank Senator Trood for a very important question. Global climate change and greenhouse gas emissions are incredibly important issues—some would say the most important challenge for the globe. The Australian government shares a strong commitment to taking practical and real actions, both internationally and domestically, to address the risk of serious climate change from greenhouse gas emissions. I am pleased to report to the Senate—I am sure Senator Trood would be keen to hear this—that the world-leading Asia-Pacific Partnership on Clean Development and Climate, which met so successfully in Sydney in mid-January, has established eight working groups, or task forces, to put in place practical measures, new partnerships and new projects in a whole range of areas.</para>
</talk.start>
<para>These task forces will have their first meetings in mid-April. For example, the Renewable Energy and Distributed Generation Task Force, which we co-chair with Korea, will have as its aim rolling out and fast-tracking research, development and deployment of new renewable energy technologies across the partnership countries—Korea, Japan, China and India. Six nations representing nearly 50 per cent of the world’s population will get to work on rolling out and fast-tracking those technologies in April. The Cleaner Fossil Energy Task Force will also commence work, and Australia will chair that task force.</para>
<para>Senator Trood also asked about alternative statements and policies. I did see recently that Martin Ferguson, the member for Batman and opposition spokesman on resources, industry and, I think, greenhouse gas policy—even though they have a number of different views on that—made the point after the Asia-Pacific partnership meeting:</para>

Of course, he is joined by the Labor Party’s minister in the Victorian government, Theo Theophanous, who said in the <inline font-style="italic">Australian Financial Review</inline> this morning:</para>

<para>Those green lobbyists who advocate greenhouse policies that stifle growth are misguided. Economic pain would not just be politically unpopular, it would be self defeating. Growth is essential to fund the transformation of our energy base to new technologies.</para>
</quote>

<para>—I thank Senator Trood. The point that does need to be made is that Labor have no substantial investment ideas regarding how to invest in low-emissions technologies. The government, for example, will fund Geodynamics Ltd with $5 million to develop a hot rocks project in South Australia, developing steam from three kilometres underground, to transform the way that power is produced. We will spend $8 million—possibly up to $12 million—to fund the Otway project. We are spending close to $2 billion across Australia, and the only state government in Australia that is spending anything is the Victorian government, which is spending $80 million. There is nothing from WA, New South Wales or Queensland, and you have this magic bullet of an emissions trading scheme. They think that you can have a solution that does not cost any money. We want to see this invisible policy with no money involved, and we want to see the details of it, not just this concept of a magic bullet or a silver bullet.</para>

<para>—My question is to Senator Minchin, the Minister for Finance and Administration, representing the Treasurer. I refer to the release today of Australia’s December current account figures, showing a significant increase in the quarterly deficit to $14.4 billion, up from $13.7 billion. At the same time, Australia’s net foreign debt has reached record highs of $473 billion, up $52 billion in one year alone. Given these debts are increasing at a time of record mineral export prices, when will the government even acknowledge that there is a problem and a significant increasing risk to Australia’s economy and take action to stabilise the debt and hopefully reduce its escalation?</para>

<para>—As always, I welcome Labor questions on the economy. At least it indicates that they are focusing on the main game. We welcome discussion of Australia’s current account position, although I note that as the Labor Party stares down the barrel of 10 years in opposition it still pains them to remember the campaign of 1996. However, there is a very big difference between 1996 and now in relation to Australia’s economic position. I will first refer to the point that Senator Sherry made, which is the release today of the balance of payments figures.</para>
</talk.start>
<para>The current account deficit has widened to $14.4 billion in the December quarter, but there is some good news hidden in those figures. The deficit on goods and services rose by just one per cent. The deficit in relation to goods actually fell by four per cent, or $177 million, and the improvement in the trade balance in relation to goods which occurred in the December quarter was driven by a six per cent rise in exports during the quarter. What is going on in relation to the trade in goods and services must reflect what is going on in the resources sector of the economy—to wit, the imports of capital goods were up 24 per cent, reflecting the very strong investment under way in the Australian economy to generate the powerful resources exports which we are doing.</para>
<para>I also draw Senator Sherry’s attention to another document released today—the ABARE release on Australian commodities, which forecasts commodity exports rising by seven per cent in the next financial year to a new Australian record of $134 billion. The value of iron ore exports is expected to rise by 26 per cent next year, LNG exports are to be up by 22 per cent and farm exports are also forecast to rise.</para>
<para>The real point about the Australian current account—as I am sure Senator Sherry knows—is that it reflects the difference between investment and savings. This country has always relied on—and will continue to rely on for a very long time—foreign investment to ensure that its economy continues to sustain the sort of growth that we need and want. What matters is the capacity to service those investments. Given the trade performance, the current account is really reflecting that strong investment inflow and, by definition, the outflow to foreign investors.</para>
<para>Indeed, there is an interesting quirk in this whole measure of the current account and the outflow. The RBA has pointed out that a large proportion of the earnings of companies in Australia that would, by definition, be payable back to foreign investors are in fact retained by those Australian companies. They are not paid out as dividends but the accounting treatment still classifies them as an income flow to offshore investors.</para>
<para>When examining Australia’s current account, one must take account of the fact that it is driven largely by the difference between investment and savings and that the investment reflects foreign investors’ confidence in Australia. The worst thing that could possibly happen to the Australian economy is any diminution in that confidence of foreign investors in Australia. That is the thing to fear—that, for some reason, foreigners lose their enthusiasm for investing in this country. By definition, foreign investment involves an outflow of earnings by those foreign investors, which is reflected in the current account.</para>
<para>As to foreign debt, I think the most important point to make is the difference between now and 1996, and that is that virtually none of that is reflected in the public sector contribution. All that debt is private sector debt. Having paid off the government debt that we were left, there is no government contribution to that total of foreign debt. The debt servicing ratio now is around nine per cent compared to the peak under Labor of 20 per cent. <inline font-style="italic">(Time expired)</inline>

I refer the minister to the footage screened on the <inline font-style="italic">60 Minutes</inline> program last Sunday night showing extreme cruelty being inflicted on cattle at a slaughterhouse in Egypt that regularly receives Australian animals as part of our live export trade. Can the minister give an assurance to the Senate and the Australian public that none of the sheep or cattle exported to the Middle East in their hundreds of thousands will be subjected to the sort of extreme cruelty that has now been documented a number of times as occurring in many of the areas they are sent to? Is the minister also aware that, according to the Australian Federation of Islamic Councils, Middle Eastern countries already accept over 50,000 tonnes of meat slaughtered in Australia in a halal accredited manner—the equivalent of over two million animals? Why does the government not put as much energy into expanding the slaughtered meat trade from Australia as it does trying to boost the live animal trade, which clearly involves cruelty levels that many Australians find unacceptable?</para>

<para>—The images on <inline font-style="italic">60 Minutes</inline> show practices that are totally unacceptable to, I would imagine, all Australians. Can I say, as a former honorary legal adviser to the RSPCA in my home state of Tasmania for a number of years, those sorts of images appal me just as much as I am sure they appal Senator Bartlett.</para>
</talk.start>
<para>I am able to inform the senator that the Egyptian government has told our industry that these practices are illegal in Egypt as well. Mr McGauran has written to his counterpart in the Egyptian government asking for advice on how investigations into these allegations and these practices are going to be carried out and whether or not these practices are common in Egyptian abattoirs. I am assured that the Egyptian authorities view this issue as seriously as we do here.</para>
<para>The Australian government and the livestock export industry take animal welfare issues very seriously. The industry operates under practices that lead the world in ensuring good animal welfare procedures are in place along the supply chain to the port of unloading. No other country has done as much to this end. This is not, however, the end of the story. Australia has been working directly with a number of countries in the Middle East to improve animal welfare practices up to and including the point of slaughter. Members of the Gulf Cooperation Council in the Middle East recently committed to working with Australia to improve animal handling practices across the entire region. This follows meetings involving Australian officials where recent international guidelines were discussed.</para>
<para>We have also been active in Egypt. The abattoir mentioned in the <inline font-style="italic">60 Minutes</inline> footage has received funding from both the Australian government and Australian industry to improve stock handling and processing practices. This has included provision and installation of a restraint box to assist with the humane slaughter of cattle. The allegation by <inline font-style="italic">60 Minutes</inline> that it is not being used has been refuted by industry. Mr McGauran has sent the Australian consul for agriculture, fisheries and forestry in this region to investigate the allegation in association with Egyptian authorities. If we find that the <inline font-style="italic">60 Minutes</inline> allegations are accurate, there will be no further cattle shipped to Egypt until conditions have improved.</para>
<para>I note some suggestions that the cattle displayed in those horrific scenes did not originate from Australia, but all those matters are currently being investigated. The simple fact is, I think, that we in Australia condemn the practices that were portrayed on our TV sets the other night. We as an Australian government are taking that very seriously. That is why my colleague Mr McGauran has announced that exports to Egypt have been terminated in the interim, until further investigations can take place.</para>

I remind the minister of the part of my question that asked whether or not the Australian government would put extra energy into expanding the already quite significant slaughtered meat trade from Australia to Middle Eastern countries. I also ask who the minister is relying on for information about how well these concerns are being addressed. Clearly Minister McGauran was surprised to see the footage on <inline font-style="italic">60 Minutes</inline>, even though the Animals Australia organisation had notified him about those concerns as far back as last July. Is this another case reminiscent of the AWB situation, where the government and the minister simply rely on assurances from industry that everything is going fine and do not listen to anybody with concerns about the way the industry operates?</para>

<para>—I did indicate in my previous answer that Mr McGauran had sent the Australian consul for agriculture, fisheries and forestry in the region to investigate the allegations in association with the Egyptian authorities. It seems appropriate that we rely on people of that nature to do the investigations for us. It always is unfortunate when people do let you down. You do trust people, you do pay people to do the right thing, and that is why we do have mechanisms in place to try to ensure that people do not do the wrong thing. But unfortunately, human nature being what it is, we will have these outbreaks from time to time of activities that are not acceptable. Indeed, the Egyptian authorities themselves have said that these practices are allegedly illegal in Egypt—and yet they do take place. If the Egyptians themselves cannot control that activity, I suppose it is even more difficult for us as Australians to try to control that activity in Egypt. <inline font-style="italic">(Time expired)</inline>

<para>—The interesting thing about this is that Labor argues that payphones are a fall-back option for people living in rural areas if they are unable to use a mobile phone. The sad reality is that if Labor had its way payphones would be the only option people would have in rural and regional Australia. Labor would certainly have kept payphones profitable because under a Labor government that would be the only phone people would have in rural and regional areas. Under Labor, people could wait more than two years to have their home phone connected. What an absolute disgrace! Labor closed down analog mobile phones, leaving rural Australians stranded without a service at all. Labor has no real plan to connect rural and regional Australians to broadband. Under Labor, the idea of rural and regional Australians using new technologies like voice over IP would be unthinkable.</para>
</talk.start>
</continue>
<para>So while payphones are a very important community service, and they will be maintained where they are subject to the universal service obligation, imagine how critical they would become if Labor were in charge of regional communications. Regional Australians are not fooled by Labor on this issue. They know that if Senator Conroy had his way thousands of rural households that rely on satellite internet services would have their subsidies scrapped. Every subsidy for rural and regional Australia, according to Senator Conroy, is pork-barrelling. It is an absolute disgrace. I have a bit of free advice for Senator Conroy: if you want to find out what is going on in regional Australia, get out of your office in Melbourne and go and ask.</para>

<para>—Mr President, I ask a supplementary question. Can the minister confirm that Telstra is required to maintain only 7,500 payphones throughout Australia under the USO, and is not currently able to account for hundreds of these payphones in its records? How can the universal service obligation possibly provide service guarantees for rural and regional Australia if Telstra is unable to identify its USO payphones? Given that Telstra is intent on doing the absolute minimum required for rural and regional Australia, isn’t the lack of clarity in the USO an open invitation to further slash payphone numbers? When will you table the map you have asked for? When will you table the hit list of the phones to go?</para>

<para>—I will say this very slowly for Senator Conroy’s benefit. This government will ensure that where people need payphones they will have them. This government will ensure that where people need broadband they will get it. This government will ensure that where people need telecommunications they will have it, irrespective of where they live. There is no doubt whatsoever that payphones will be maintained under the universal service obligation. Senator Conroy really needs to go and stick to his day job of branch stacking.</para>

<motion>
<para>That the Senate take note of the answers given by the Minister for Ageing (Senator Santoro) to questions without notice asked by Senators McLucas, Moore and Marshall today relating to aged care.</para>
</motion>
<para class="block">The pattern that was established by the Minister for Ageing in his responses to questions yesterday has been confirmed today. Yesterday, Minister Santoro refused to answer specific questions about the George Vowell aged care facility and the Immanuel Gardens facility on the Sunshine Coast. Yesterday, he either avoided, dismissed or did not bother responding to questions. They were specific questions that demanded an answer. They demand a response not only for the people who sit in this chamber but also for the community, which is seeking to understand the appalling events that we have been confronted with over the last eight days—appalling events that require the minister to come clean with the Australia community and tell us what has been occurring. But, unfortunately, today the minister again did not answer specific questions that we believe demand a response.</para>
<para>In fact, the minister did not even acknowledge the questions in some of the responses that he made. He did not acknowledge the issues that have been legitimately raised to try to understand the atrociousness and appalling nature of the allegations that we have heard. I asked the minister today whether he could confirm that a resident’s allegations of abuse, at an unnamed facility in March 2005, were dismissed by the provider, with the police being called only when a second allegation of a similar nature was raised. He said it was ‘disturbing’. We know that. It is disturbing to everybody. He is the minister and we demand that he moves on from ‘disturbing’. We are all disturbed, but the minister for aged care has a responsibility to explain to the community what has led to this set of events. How does it happen that a facility allows nine months to elapse between an allegation occurring and the police finally being called?</para>
<para>I asked the minister what action was taken. He did not even respond to that question. He did not make any attempt to tell us what action is being taken to investigate why that occurred. He did not try at all to explain what he is doing to investigate the claim that an elderly woman was forced to confront the person who allegedly attacked her. None of us can move away from being appalled at that. I think it is the most shocking example of inappropriate dealing with an alleged sexual assault event to make a person, an older person with a brain injury, confront their attacker. But Minister Santoro did nothing to explain that today. He did nothing to tell us what he has done in terms of investigating that complaint. This man is the Minister for Ageing in Australia. He has the responsibility to explain to the community what is occurring in a facility that allows a circumstance like that to occur. I asked him if he had full confidence in the protection provided to frail elderly residents under the government’s aged care system. I asked a similar question of him yesterday. Yesterday, he did not provide the Senate with the view that he had full confidence in the department, in the aged care accreditation agency or in the complaints resolution scheme.</para>

And if he did not have confidence, he could have then explained which areas he was going to fix so that he could have his confidence restored. That is what the Australian community needs: we need our confidence restored in our aged care system. We know that there are quality providers of aged care out there who are being brought down by the allegations that have been made. We have now four allegations of incredibly appalling abuse of older Australians. This is not just a one-off anymore; this is something that needs more than a meeting in a couple of weeks time. When this was first announced, it was an urgent summit. We were going to pull people together very quickly, and all of a sudden we have found our courtesy and we have got to wait three weeks. I am sorry: the families of these residents cannot sit around waiting for a meeting to happen. We want to see some action from this minister. We want the minister to explain: why does this happen in aged care facilities in Australia? <inline font-style="italic">(Time expired)</inline>

<para>—I am happy to contribute to this debate by saying that apparently I was sitting through a different question time to the one that Senator McLucas sat through this afternoon. I heard the Minister for Ageing answer several questions from the other side of the chamber, and I heard him on each occasion fully respond to the question that was asked of him. He was asked on several indications to indicate what he was doing about these allegations, and I heard him answer quite distinctly that they were being investigated.</para>

<para>—I know you want answers, Senator McLucas; we all want answers. Nobody anywhere in this chamber or anywhere in Australia is pleased to hear about these cases. Four cases—albeit out of 100,000 residential placements in Australia—are still, as the minister himself said, four too many. I am disturbed about that and you are disturbed about that. Let us find what the facts are before we jump to conclusions. The minister said, ‘I’m investigating these matters.’ I heard him say that; I am sorry if you did not hear it. Let us see what the investigation reveals before we jump to our feet with sound and fury, signifying nothing. I want to find out what is going on in Australia’s nursing homes. I certainly understand that these problems indicate that a serious examination of our complaints mechanism needs to be made. The minister has indicated that he has a review on his table of Australia’s complaints mechanism and is examining that.</para>
</talk.start>
</continue>
<para>If members opposite think that, after four weeks as Minister for Ageing in Australia, somehow we should have a whole set of answers laid out in front of the Senate on those questions they are being, with great respect, grossly unreasonable. This minister has inherited these issues. None of these issues that were raised in the Senate in the last few days occurred while the minister was Minister for Ageing. They occurred long before his tenure began. He is attempting to ascertain what occurred and to find the facts as the first step in dealing with a problem. Who has a better solution than that, to a problem that might present itself? He is attempting to put in place an appropriate, measured response to those issues. I know members opposite would love to dive in straightaway and believe that they have got all the answers. I remind members that what is being said in most of the cases that have been raised in the media are still allegations. Members opposite are treating these things as proven facts. They are not facts; they are allegations, for the most part, and they need to be examined. In one case, I understand, they were examined by the police at one stage and no charges arose out of that, so we need to be very wary about jumping to conclusions.</para>
<para>The minister inherits a system, however, which is a strong system. This is a system which has had an enormous investment in it by the Australian government over the last 10 years. Spending on aged care in this country has more than doubled in the time since this government came to office. I remind members that the aged population of Australia has nowhere near doubled in that time. In other words, we have made up for a lack of appropriate investment by our predecessors in this sector, and that investment continues to this day. Just last year’s budget provided $320.6 million over four years in new initiatives to support people with dementia and their carers. That is the kind of measure which is going to make a tangible difference to those cases like the one where an elderly person with brain injury was alleged to have been abused and was then not taken seriously. They are the sorts of initiatives that are going to make a difference. That is money that is on the table and is now being spent to deal with those problems. We are spending an additional $207.6 million to increase the availability of respite care for a further 1.3 million days over four years, and there is $152 million for a $1,000 per resident one-off payment to aged-care providers, to lift the quality available in Australia’s nursing homes.</para>
<para>Members opposite can make a great-sounding case that this should all have been fixed in the first 28 days of this minister’s tenure. I think most Australians are a bit more realistic than that. They acknowledge that these problems are real but are prepared to work with the government and with these kinds of commitments to see these problems solved. That is a mature and appropriate approach. Nobody underplays the importance of these issues, but they are receiving the attention they deserve. Members opposite should stop playing politics with these incredibly sensitive issues and acknowledge that they are ones that deserve calm and considered responses. <inline font-style="italic">(Time expired)</inline>

<para>—What a disappointing defence of the Minister for Ageing that Senator Humphries has just made. To come to the Senate and suggest to us that because the minister has only been in charge of his portfolio for some 28 days somehow the government has no accountability, no responsibility for fixing this mess and no responsibility for this mess in the first place is very disappointing. The only thing more disappointing today was the incompetence shown by this minister in not answering the questions and not really going to the issues that underpin the substantial flaws in the aged care system.</para>
</talk.start>
<para>Senator Humphries well knows that these issues are not new. Even though these issues have just become public recently, these issues have been well known for a long time. Senator Humphries was involved in an inquiry into the aged care system—an inquiry which I chaired. We actually tabled a unanimous Senate report. Every single member of that inquiry unanimously supported all of the recommendations. That report was tabled in June 2005. Some of the recommendations, which I will come to in a minute, go to the very crux of the problem that we are being confronted with today. They go to problems with the complaints resolution procedure, the intimidation of families of residents who actually make complaints, people being dissuaded from making complaints, the complaints process not actually accepting complaints and complaints not becoming complaints unless the complaints body actually accepts them as complaints in the first place.</para>
<para>What we found in that report was that some 13 per cent of complaints that are actually made do not register as complaints because the complaints authority does not accept them as complaints. So they just fall off the radar. Senator Santoro, the minister responsible at this present point in time, suggests to us that, because less than 50 per cent of people who actually complain fill in a survey and some percentage in that survey say they are somewhat satisfied with the complaints system, we can then say that everything must be okay with the complaints system. That is really a bridge too far for this Senate to accept.</para>
<para>The recommendations were tabled in June 2005. The normal process for the government is to actually respond to Senate reports within a period of three months. What has this government done with the aged care report which identifies the problems with the accreditation standards and many other issues to do with aged care? Has there been a response? No, there has not been a response. I actually put to the Senate on 6 October last year my concern that the government had not responded to that committee inquiry of the previous June. I asked why the minister was publicly talking about some of the problems with aged care but had not responded to the Senate report which identified some of these problems. Maybe if that minister had taken her responsibilities seriously at the time then Senator Santoro as the minister responsible today might not be in the mess that he is in.</para>
<para>This is a mess that could have been avoided by this government because these issues have been made public. They have been tabled before the Senate. Senator Humphries cannot simply say, ‘Give the minister a chance.’ I asked the minister directly today about the Senate report. He did not even mention the Senate report. Senator Humphries, you suggested that the minister answered all of the questions fully. You ought to go back and check <inline font-style="italic">Hansard</inline>. Read the question I asked and you will see that Senator Santoro made no effort at all to answer my question. He went off on a tangent to talk about the complaints facility but did not come back to the Senate inquiry, which was the basis of my question.</para>
<para>I will go to some of the elements of the inquiry. I think it is certainly worth while. Some of the recommendations go to one of the very important aspects of this—that is, whistleblower protection; actually giving employees in nursing nomes protection to enable them to complain about the standards and treatment of people in their care. They should have protection for doing that because we know—and the Senate report talks about it—about a culture of intimidation in some nursing homes. I do not want to paint a picture that all nursing homes are bad. We do not believe that and we say that is not true. The majority of nursing homes are good and they provide adequate care. But where there is inappropriate care and illegal activity, the system does not enable it to be dealt with. <inline font-style="italic">(Time expired)</inline>

<para>—I am quite pleased to stand here to take note of answers by Minister Santo Santoro. What the Minister for Ageing did in responding to questions from Labor senators on the other side of the chamber was entirely appropriate. He gave direct, straight answers to the questions. He said that he would look into the matter. He has organised meetings. He advised the Senate and the public when these meetings would be held and who they would be held with. He also advised that he would be taking on board any other advice and information from representatives of the aged care community and he was happy to have one-on-one meetings with those representatives over the days and weeks ahead.</para>
</talk.start>
<para>What was very important in his response was that he said that he would not be providing a knee-jerk response. This is exactly the type of response that the Labor Party is hoping the minister will provide. He is smarter than that, you see. He is more measured and professional than that. He is going to be an excellent Minister for Ageing. The minister, as people on the other side know, is one of the hardest working senators. He will be looking into these matters with the greatest amount of vigour that you could ever imagine. As Senator Humphries has indicated, we are talking about four incidents—in fact, four allegations have been made. They will be looked into. I think everyone in this place and in the community would support a 100 per cent effort to ensure that the quality of care provided in Australia’s aged care facilities is first class and, in fact, world class. The minister’s responses were entirely appropriate.</para>
<para>What I do want to highlight, however, is what has happened in the aged care sector since 1996, when Labor left office. There has been a vast improvement. What was happening in and around 1996 was that we were caught up in red tape. There was a lot of difficulty in providing a quality service, access to those aged care services and a viable industry. They are the three key planks: providing a quality service, providing access to those aged care services and ensuring a viable industry. That was not happening in 1996. Do you know what has happened since then? There has been a more than doubling of funding and an injection of funds into the aged care sector. We had a review under Minister Julie Bishop. Prior to her we had the excellent leadership of Minister Kevin Andrews. They were great ministers for ageing and aged care. Pursuant to that review, you might recall, in the 2004 budget we had a $2.2 billion injection into the aged care sector over a number of years. That was a huge boost. We all remember when that announcement was made. We said that that was fantastic for older Australians who find themselves heading towards the possibility of moving into an aged care facility, whether it is high care or low care.</para>
<para>Indeed, community aged care packages have gone through the roof exponentially under the government. We have a policy of encouraging older Australians to stay in their homes, if they would most prefer it, and we provide funds to make that happen. There has been a boost in funding to Home and Community Care provisions to ensure that the services and the maintenance in and around the home can be undertaken so that older Australians can stay in their homes. You might say, ‘How do I know what was happening in and around 1996?’ Well, I can tell you. I was on the board of St Ann’s, one of the oldest age cared facilities in Tasmania, for eight years. I know how hard it was for an aged care provider in Tasmania to remain viable and to provide quality care and access to that quality care in and around the southern Tasmanian and Hobart region. I have a lot of time and respect for Susan Parr, the CEO of St Ann’s, and she remains in that position providing excellent leadership not only at St Ann’s but in Tasmania.</para>
<para>As a Tasmanian senator, let me say that I am proud of the Tasmanian aged care sector. They provide excellent quality care across the board. There may be incidents from time to time, but the leadership provided by Aged and Community Services Tasmania is par excellence. <inline font-style="italic">(Time expired)</inline>

<para>—I am really saddened to have to stand in this place this afternoon to make some note about the responses the Minister for Ageing gave to us on questions that covered a whole range of issues in the aged care industry. We have the absolute horror of the allegations of elder abuse that has come forward, and I think it needs an immediate response. It is not being bulldozed, as the minister said, into a knee-jerk response. What we and the wider community expect is that the horror of these allegations is acknowledged and that there is some form of urgent response to those issues of abuse. There is no other way to describe it. It seems to me that a process must be put in place to have an urgent response to those issues.</para>
</talk.start>
<para>Wider issues were raised this afternoon. There was the issue of the systemic operation of aged care in our community. In terms of the responses the minister gave, we were able to extract some information today that were actually supplementary responses to questions that were asked yesterday specifically about the accreditation of an aged care home on the Sunshine Coast, the Immanuel home. Senator McLucas, who asked very specialised questions yesterday about that process, was not able to get any answers. When I asked follow-up questions today, the minister had obviously receive some information overnight. Perhaps, as he acknowledged, he watched <inline font-style="italic">Lateline</inline> and saw some of the issues that were being raised across the board, and he was able to respond to us on that. He was able today, not yesterday, to give us some detail of the accreditation process that was put in place for the age care home on the Sunshine Coast. He was able to, ponderously, go through step by step how the accreditation process operates. What he could not give us was any sense of genuine confidence that that accreditation process was responding to—and I quote directly from my question and from the accreditation process—‘a record of persistent failure to comply with accreditation standards over the last three years’.</para>
<para>We are not talking about an urgent issue about which no-one had any knowledge; we are talking about an established age care facility that was subject to the accreditation process, which we worked through in the Senate Community Affairs References Committee and which tabled the report, to which Senator Marshall referred, <inline font-style="italic">Quality and equity in aged care</inline>. We were given advice then about how the accreditation process operates. A range of witnesses came before that inquiry, raising concerns about how they felt the process operated and wanting to be involved in some solutions, because everybody shares the concern about ensuring that our older Australians have access to safe, quality aged care. The minister made that point yesterday, and I think again today, that we all have this concern.</para>
<para>Through the aged care Senate inquiry, which, as Senator Marshall said, reported to this place in June 2005, we gave 51 unanimous recommendations that were gathered together over months during that inquiry and while working with many of the same people that the minister has said he will be meeting with in early March. I will call it a meeting; he may call it a ‘summit’. But it is not that urgent, because it is taking several weeks to happen. Many of those people, if not all of them—and I will check that to make sure—gave evidence to our inquiry. One of the core aspects of that was the absolute necessity to have community confidence in the assessment process. We know there must be standards in terms of care for aged Australians. There are a range of those, and anybody can access that through the website or contacting the accreditation agency, and there are processes for each agency to be assessed. The minister did talk through how some of that occurred.</para>
<para>What we did not have was immediate action on a persistent failure to meet those standards over three years. Minister, this is not a knee-jerk reaction. We want some confidence in a system that is public and has been lauded as one of the best in the world. I do have great respect for the people who work in this system. But where there is persistent failure to meet standards there must be immediate action; otherwise, how will things be fixed? Minister, do not feel bulldozed into taking action, which you said maybe you felt today; actually feel the commitment to take action to meet the expectations of the community. <inline font-style="italic">(Time expired)</inline>

<motion>
<para>That the Senate take note of the answer given by the Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs (Senator Vanstone) to a question without notice asked by Senator Nettle today relating to the detention of and compensation for Ms Cornelia Rau.</para>
</motion>
<para class="block">Cornelia Rau was found over a year ago suffering from untreated schizophrenia in Baxter detention centre. In the time leading up to the report by the Palmer inquiry, which looked at Cornelia Rau’s case, the government continued to say that they would not deal with any issues relating to compensation or other issues until they had received the Palmer report. The Prime Minister said that there was an inquiry process under way and that until the Palmer inquiry reported it was not the government’s intention to contemplate or discuss other issues. He said that when the findings of the Palmer inquiry were in then all the circumstances could be assessed and further attention could be given to what should be done. He acknowledged in parliament the difficult experience that Cornelia Rau had gone through—which I think is an understatement.</para>
<para>The Palmer inquiry reported on 14 July of last year, yet we still have not heard from the government what concrete steps they are taking to resolve this issue. I acknowledge that the process with her lawyers has taken some time. There is hope on the part of her lawyers and, as the minister indicated, on the part of the government that the issue can be resolved outside the courts through a negotiated agreement. But we are not getting any closer to any compensation being paid along the way. Unfortunately, the delays are similar to those that we saw in the case of Vivian Solon, where it took so long for the Department of Immigration and Multicultural Affairs and the lawyers involved to decide on a way in which this could be determined.</para>
<para>One would hope, looking at that situation from the outside, that it could be resolved and that a process could be set in place in the case of Vivian Solon so that when we got to Cornelia Rau—and, hopefully, there will be nobody else down the track—there would be a process in place to determine how these issues could be resolved. It is now over six months since Palmer reported and over a year since Cornelia Rau was found and released, and she still has not received one cent in compensation.</para>
<para>Part of the difficulty for people in the Australian community in understanding what has happened in detention centres and what kinds of circumstances people are being held in is the isolation that people experience because they are detainees in remote detention centres. The very remoteness of the detention centres themselves is an issue. Cornelia Rau, for example, was first taken into custody in Far North Queensland and then wound up behind razor wire in the remote detention centre of Baxter. Similarly, another group of detainees, the West Papuan asylum seekers, arrived in Far North Queensland. They have been taken even further away than Cornelia Rau was and are now over on the extremely remote external territory of Christmas Island.</para>
<para>From answers given by the department of immigration in Senate estimates the other week, it appears to be the government’s intention to send a large number of detainees over to Christmas Island. That is why, on Christmas Island at the moment, a massive new detention centre is being built. It is an enormous detention centre that is intended to hold 800 beds. When you go and look at the size of the construction that is going on, it is easy to believe that there is an intention to hold many more than 800 people there. It is an enormous facility. The department of immigration said in the last estimates that the latest figure for the spending on that was $210 million, but there is clearly an intention to build a lot more and spend a lot more.</para>
<para>This is not something that the people of Christmas Island are welcoming onto their island, either. One of them commented to me that they do not want to be an island of gulags—I think that was the language that was used. The shire president said that the only carrot that had been waved in front of him and others from Christmas Island was the possibility of 20 local jobs. Twenty local jobs at a facility that is designed to have 800 people is hardly a great offer to the people of Christmas Island. It is unsurprising that they are saying that they simply do not want this facility to be built.</para>
<para>It is partly the remoteness of Christmas Island and other detention centres that means that we do not hear about the circumstances of people like Cornelia Rau and Vivian Alvarez. That is what leads the government to the point that they are at now, where they are having to deal with these compensation issues. Unfortunately, they continue to drag out the compensation issues so that they cannot be resolved. Worse than that, they build more detention centres. <inline font-style="italic">(Time expired)</inline>

<para class="block">To the Honourable the President and Members of the Senate in Parliament assembled:</para>
<para class="block">We, the undersigned citizens of Australia draw to the attention of the Senate the common incidence of children being exposed to Internet websites portraying explicit sexual images. These images may involve children/teens, sexual violence, bestiality, and other disturbing material. Many such websites use aggressive, deceptive or intrusive techniques to induce viewing. We submit to the Senate that:</para>
<list type="bullet">
<item>
<para>Exposure to pornography is a form of sexual assault against children and should be considered, like all sexual abuse of children, as a serious matter causing lasting harm.</para>
</item>
<item>
<para>It is not adequate to charge individual parents with the chief responsibility for protecting their children from Internet pornographers determined to promote their product, OR to expect parents to teach children to cope with the damaging effects of pornographic images AFTER exposure.</para>
</item>
<item>
<para>It is the primary duty of community and Government to prevent children being exposed to pornography in the first place by placing restrictions on pornographers and those businesses distributing such material.</para>
</item>
<item>
<para>Internet Service Providers (ISPs), should accept responsibility for protecting children from Internet pornography, including liability for harm caused to children by inadequate efforts to protect minors from exposure.</para>
</item>
</list>
<para class="block">Your petitioners therefore, pray that the Senate take legislative action to restrict children’s exposure to Internet pornography. We support the introduction of mandatory filtering of pornographic content by ISPs and age verification technology to restrict minor’s access.</para>

<para>That the Senate take note of the document.</para>
</motion>
<para class="block">Report No. 30 of 2005-06 is yet another important report by the Australian National Audit Office. As I have said on a number of other occasions, thank goodness for the Audit Office. For all of those people listening to the broadcast of this debate, I note that the Audit Office is a statutory independent office responsible for the detailed oversight—auditing—of government departments, instrumentalities, programs and the like. It is important because it is independent and fearless in its examination of instrumentalities and programs. Against a backdrop of declining standards of governance in this country, as practised by this government, the Audit Office becomes one of our last bastions for ensuring independent and effective scrutiny of the activities of government and its instrumentalities—in this case, the Australian Taxation Office.</para>
<para>The Audit Office has highlighted a number of issues in respect of the tax office’s collection of what is called the taxation that accrues from the cash economy. It is interesting to note that the Audit Office outlines how in fact we measure and estimate the value of the cash economy—and, by definition, the cash economy would be hard to value. It refers to the lower end range of estimates made by the Australian Bureau of Statistics in 2003, which estimated that the cash economy represented about two per cent of gross domestic product, which it thought understated it. Translating that into a dollar figure gives a value of the cash economy in 2001-02 of about $13.4 billion—so it would be likely to be much higher today—on which taxation is not paid.</para>
<para>I smiled a little at the opening comment in paragraph 1.3 of the report, which stated, I thought rather boldly, that ‘the use of cash is not illegal’. I am glad that it is not! They point out:</para>
<quote>
<para class="block">... what is illegal is the non-declaration of cash income or the misstatement of expenses for tax purposes that is facilitated by cash transactions without proper receipts and other documentation.</para>
</quote>
<para class="block">I am glad to hear that the use of cash is not illegal in Australia—at least not yet. But it is a serious issue. I cast my mind back to the debate we had in respect of the introduction of the goods and services tax in this country. I am sure people would remember that this was defined, from the Liberal government’s point of view, as the reform that was aimed at fixing a broken tax system. One of the issues that was debated at that time was the cash economy. It was argued by the Liberal government that a goods and services tax would at least partly fix the revenue gap or hole that was a consequence of the cash economy.</para>
<para>What is interesting by way of background regarding the identification of the size of our cash economy is that it has actually grown with the GST. It has not shrunk. I find that unsurprising, frankly. If you think about the GST, it is not surprising that the cash economy has grown, yet this was seriously advanced by the Liberal government as one of the reasons for introducing a GST in this country. They also claimed that the tax system was broken and that income tax and company tax were not going to be able to sustain future government expenditure. That was another absurd claim made at the time that the GST was introduced. What do we have today? We have record collections of income and company tax. So the old tax system was not broken; that was simply a con job by the government, massively promoted at taxpayers’ expense, to convince the electorate to support the introduction of a GST.</para>
<para>Coming back to the cash economy, it is important that the tax office is vigilant in this area in order to ensure that the at least $13.4 billion—considerably higher than that now—is available for tax purposes. The Audit Office made five or six recommendations in respect of the tax office improving its approach to collecting and maximising the tax revenue from the cash economy. I have only had about 10 minutes to read the report but it does not appear to identify what I would call significant failings by the tax office. There are a number of recommendations that I am pleased to see that the tax office has accepted in order to improve compliance activity and tax collection in this area. The report indicates:</para>
<quote>
<para>Over the past three years the chances of businesses in cash economy industries being reviewed by the ATO has increased. The cash economy teams—</para>
</quote>
<para class="block">and there are specific teams—</para>
<quote>
<para class="block">have contacted over 123 000 businesses where cash trading is prevalent and this has led to extra tax of over $352 million being assessed. Many of these businesses were assisted to keep better records making it easier to meet their obligations.</para>
</quote>
<para class="block">I referred there to cash economy industries. The report does identify a number of industries which are more susceptible to cash economy transactions. These include—and this would not come as a surprise to anyone who is listening—businesses such as hotels, clubs, the construction industry, restaurants, cafes and takeaways. They are just some of the industries that are identified as cash economy industries. Table 3.2 is a useful table which lists the number of cases and revenue adjustments from cash economy projects in 2004-05. For example, in hotels and clubs there was a revenue adjustment of some $27 million, with the number of cases finalised being over 5,200. That is a lot of intensive casework. That is just illustrative. In property and construction there were some 13,700 cases, and in restaurants, cafes and takeaways there were over 10,000 cases, with the revenue breakdown collected.</para>
<para>Overall, it appears that the Audit Office are satisfied with the activities of the ATO in this area. There could be some room for improvement in some six areas, but the ATO has accepted the recommendations of the Audit Office. As I said, by general standards this is not too bad a report in terms of any shortcomings or failings identified by the Audit Office. I have had occasion to speak on a number of other Audit Office reports over the last few years, and I would have to say that this is one of the more benign reports in terms of activities, failings or problems that are identified. There have been far worse reports. I think amongst the worst was the Audit Office report into defence equipment, which identified that there was some $5.9 billion in defence department equipment missing. That was amongst the worst reports.</para>
<para>With those few words about this report, I conclude my remarks by saying that the Audit Office performs a very important role. I know it does not get a lot of public attention, but it has an independent statutory oversight. I only wish it had got into that Wheat Board a bit earlier. It is pity that the Audit Office did not have a hard look at the Wheat Board and some of the activities there. I seek leave to continue my remarks later.</para>

<para>That the Senate take note of the documents.</para>
</motion>
<para class="block">This report is one to the Senate from the Foreign Affairs, Defence and Trade Legislation Committee, and I am particularly interested in volume 2 of this report because that deals with the Foreign Affairs and Trade portfolio—the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade, AusAID and Austrade. Of particular interest to the Senate is the fact that on pages 4, 5 and 6 of this report we have answers to questions from senators which were asked on 3 November 2005 in relation to the Australian Wheat Board. I might come back to those answers in a short while.</para>
<para>However, this stands in very stark contrast to the approach of the government in relation to not only the foreign affairs and trade estimates committee but all estimates committees in the recent round. Senators would recall that in an absolutely unprecedented action the Leader of the Government in the Senate indicated that ministers and officials would not be answering any questions in relation to matters that may, however loosely or indirectly, have some vague association with matters before the Cole royal commission. In fact, it was interpreted even more broadly than that.</para>
<para>How did this come about? Neither the Labor Party—the opposition—nor, for that matter, any non-government senators were informed of this ban. The cabinet had made a decision some time before Minister Minchin indicated to the estimates committee that the ban had been imposed. When this Senate chamber determined the arrangements for the Senate estimates committees, no-one in government had the courtesy to inform the opposition or non-government senators that questions on this important matter that had been dominating public and parliamentary debate in the week prior to Senate estimates were banned. No-one acknowledged or notified senators in this chamber that they were about to be ambushed by the government.</para>
<para>It was unprecedented. It was improper. It was absolutely outside the standing orders that govern the operations of this Senate chamber and the committees of the Senate. It was something that had never previously occurred in the history of the Commonwealth parliament. I suppose you do not expect much courtesy in this place but, for this government, it plumbed new depths. But this is a government that has absolutely no interest in parliamentary accountability.</para>
<para>We have a situation where when questions were asked of the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade, time and time again, when the questions were directed through the minister, the minister refused to answer. It was quite extraordinary that when questions were directed to officials from Austrade—which has statutory autonomy—there was a problem. The Minister for Trade, Mr Vaile, had not made a direction to Austrade officials in accordance with the Austrade Act so as to prevent Austrade officials answering questions. But that was ignored too. We could not even get a straight answer from the minister at the table, the Minister for Communications, Information Technology and the Arts, Senator Coonan, as to whether Mr Vaile had provided a direction in writing to Austrade officials to prevent them from answering questions properly directed to them. Why not? Because no such direction was provided in accordance with the Austrade Act by Minister Vaile. So they were hung out to dry.</para>
<para>From time to time, some questions about the operations of the department in relation to how it responded to a subpoena from the Cole royal commission, how documents were collected and other procedural or administrative issues were answered. Through recent evidence at the Cole royal commission, what has become absolutely clear in relation to those procedures in the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade is how hopeless even that action was. The Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade had a coordinating role but the procedures in other departments have also proven to be absolutely inadequate. We even had a situation where one minister was congratulated for ensuring another search took place in his department, the Department of Defence, in recent time. So the procedures within the department have been inadequate.</para>
<para>The breach of Senate procedures, the breach of proper process and the breach of faith involved in this are unprecedented in the history of the Commonwealth. Of course, the government is hell-bent, with its new Senate majority, on turning the best accountability mechanism we have in the Australian parliament into a farce and a joke. As far as the opposition are concerned, we intend to keep going.</para>
<para>We know what the Prime Minister’s theme is in relation to any questions that might embarrass him. As someone who is moving on in years, I remember in my youth Helen Shapiro’s famous hit <inline font-style="italic">Not Responsible</inline>. That is the Prime Minister’s theme song: ‘Not, not, not responsible. I can’t answer for the things I do.’ They might be Helen Shapiro’s words, but they are John Howard’s slogan. That is how this government does business: not responsible. The Prime Minister will not be responsible for his or the government’s actions. The words of the song are: ‘I can’t answer for the things I do.’ In Mr Howard’s case, he won’t answer for the things that he and his ministers have done.</para>
<para>I find it absolutely extraordinary that we have a situation where we go to war with Iraq on the basis of a lie and make the most condemnatory statements as a nation about the Saddam Hussein regime when, on the other hand, while we are doing that, through the backdoor, we are acting as Saddam Hussein’s bankers to the tune of $300 million. Under the laws of the land, introduced by the Howard government and supported in large measure by this opposition, if a person is reckless as to whether funds will be used to fund terrorism or be used to facilitate or engage in a terrorist act—if you are just reckless—the penalty is life imprisonment. So imagine what would happen in the case of an Islamic or Muslim organisation where $300,000 was channelled to Saddam Hussein. But in this case $300 million was channelled because this government turned a blind eye to what AWB were doing. It is the greatest scandal in the history of the Commonwealth of Australia. <inline font-style="italic">(Time expired)</inline>

<para>—I took no pleasure from the fact that I predicted that the government would gag public servants. I said so in a meeting of Labor Party people several days before estimates. They were a bit cynical of that view, but it proved to be right—and I take no pleasure in it. What I do not take pleasure in either was that when we asked the question: ‘Who imposed this ban?’ the answer from the minister at the table was: ‘The government.’ We asked: ‘Who in the government?’ An answer was refused. ‘When was the decision taken?’ Answer refused.</para>
</talk.start>
<para>Later in the day, the Prime Minister fessed up in the House of Representatives: it was a cabinet decision. Clearly he sent a message to Senator Minchin that we could be told the date of it, which was 6 February. But we could not even get answers to questions from the Department of the Prime Minister and Cabinet about when they received notification and whether they instructed public servants in writing. We could not even get that. So this was basically an ambush: make the decision on 6 February but don’t announce it until 13 February. Let all the Labor Party people—other than me, probably—slave away, research the issue and get prepared, and then waste all that time. That was a deliberate strategy. It is a disgraceful one because it means that other areas at estimates, when there was not going to be time for them, were not covered properly. That is a pretty cynical exploitation of the cabinet decision-making process. If it was such a principled decision made on 6 February, why wasn’t it announced then? Why weren’t we informed so we could concentrate on other areas?</para>
<para>I suppose in some ways the ban is a great compliment to Labor senators in particular. Labor senators are, apparently, feared at estimates committees. They were worried about what might come out. Let us accept none of the nonsense that, in fact, they were worried about impinging on the Cole inquiry, because the ban only applies to estimates. It does not apply to any other committee. A reference committee tomorrow considering an annual report could call the same public servants in, cross-examine them, and there would be no ban. So the government’s fear was of the estimates process, not the parliamentary process.</para>
<para>The fact is that they botched it even then. It had not applied and could not apply to statutory authorities, so the Wheat Export Authority had to come in and answer questions. But Austrade were banned even though, when you read their legislation, you have to have a written directive to be able to enforce it on them. In fact, that was an illegal act by this government. But the tragedy of this is that information that could have been pursued then may have enlightened us all. For instance, we did ask some process questions about documents that were made available, but we could not pursue it in depth.</para>
<para>And what happens today? Four new secret cables are discovered and sent to the Cole inquiry. They go back to the year 2000, to meetings in Washington, and go to Canberra recommending—but we do not know the result of it—that Mr Vaile be informed. I am not alleging that Mr Vaile was informed at that stage, but we would have liked to know why he was not informed. If these cables were coming from New York from Mr Nicholas, expressing all sorts of concerns after a meeting with Mr Flugge, why can’t we pursue those issues? The Cole commission does not have the terms of reference to fully explore the government’s role. It was deliberately cast that way so it could not. If you look at the cross-examination these are peripheral issues to the Cole inquiry, but they are core business for this Senate and the scrutiny of the executive.</para>
<para>I must say that the most disappointing aspect of this was PM&amp;C. I want to refer to the following exchange. Senator Faulkner asks the deputy secretary:</para>
<quote>
<para>Dr Morauta, when were you informed of the government decision in relation to this matter?—</para>
</quote>
<para class="block">that is, about the gag on public servants—</para>
<quote>
<para>Dr Morauta—I think I will take the question on notice.</para>

<para class="block">Only two implications can be drawn from that answer: ‘I am willing to cover it up and not say anything,’ or ‘I do not know.’ They are the only two explanations. I await a third one, if there is one. What does that say about a deputy secretary who will not answer a direct question from an estimates committee? It was not a banned question, by the way. It did not go to the AWB, it did not go to the Cole commission; it went to the processes of government. Can we really believe that a deputy secretary could not recall or did not know of this cabinet decision, when we know that the secretary of the Senate Rural, Regional and Transport Legislation Committee on the Tuesday read the decision and ultimately remembered and recalled sending out written instructions on this to public servants? Or can we believe that Mr Varghese found out about it at the start of the estimates process and noted it? The answer from DFAT is that they knew a week before and they had instructed officers. But, oh, no—in PM&amp;C the deputy secretary cannot answer that question! I think it is an absolute disgrace that witnesses take questions on notice to which they know the answer but it is politically inconvenient to give it.</para>
<para>The thing that strikes me, that is a tragedy in this government, is the dumbing down of the Department of the Prime Minister and Cabinet. I have been going to those estimates committees for 10 years and I have run into some pretty fearsome characters there, some immensely capable people. And I am just wondering whether PM&amp;C has been used too much as a recruiting ground to fill up other departments’ weaknesses and it is now left with the dross that it has got. That performance by the public servants on that day was nothing short of pathetic.</para>
<para>I predict again: by the time we get around to the May estimates some new excuse will come up not to have the public servants examined. It will be because matters are with the DPP or the report is not in, or some other reason to avoid scrutiny. Really, I do not think that is good enough. Senator Faulkner pointed out that this is not just a matter of bad form. If, in fact, money went to the Saddam Hussein regime—and the government define that regime as one that supported terrorism—then their own legislation kicks in. So we need to know the full details. We need to know what responsibility lies with the Public Service in these matters, why they did not pick up the signals and why they did not act on them. But as long as this ban is in place they are protected.</para>
<para>We are seeing the same weakness on this issue as we saw with weapons of mass destruction. It is not so much that I blame this government for its analysis and its belief that there were weapons of mass destruction or links to al-Qaeda from the Iraqi regime. That is quite feasible, on the intelligence put before them. The same goes with the AWB issue. It is that, once it occurs, there is no desire to go out and prosecute it. I have only heard one substantial Liberal come out and criticise the AWB for its activities and say that there should be possible criminal convictions. That, of course, was a minister who has absolutely nothing to do with the issue, who is isolated from it and who wants to put a bit of pressure on his colleagues because he wants to be Prime Minister. So I take that as a pretty insincere comment.</para>
<para>Any government with decency, faced with the facts that it has now got, would be roaring out there trying to find out—not hiding behind a royal commission, not gagging public servants, but taking the initiative themselves to find out what went wrong, when it went wrong and how they can rectify it. But not this government; it is not interested. It is interested in one thing and one thing alone: how can they protect themselves. They are fearful that a smoking gun will be found, so every activity is directed to distancing themselves from the department and the issue as much as they can. What I would like to see is a hungry government going out there representing the proper interests of Australia and trying to get to the bottom of this particular problem. But, oh no! The answer is: gag public servants, ambush the opposition and sit there smugly knowing you have a Senate majority and you can do what you like.</para>

<para class="block">This bill amends various taxation laws to implement a range of changes and improvements to Australia’s taxation system.</para>
<para class="block">Amendments contained in this bill ensure that parents who work less than 15 hours a week continue to be eligible for the child care tax rebate.</para>
<para class="block">To be eligible for the rebate, families must receive child care benefit for approved care and meet the child care benefit work/training/study test. The Welfare to Work package introduces a requirement that a taxpayer must work, train, or study for at least 15 hours a week —or 30 hours over 2 weeks —to meet the child care benefit work/training/study test.</para>
<para class="block">Taxpayers will not need to satisfy the new hourly requirements to receive the child care tax rebate. Taxpayers will continue to be eligible for the rebate if they receive child care benefit for approved care and work, train, or study at some time in the week.</para>
<para class="block">This bill also gives effect to the Government’s announcement that it will amend the income tax law to ensure certain not-for-profit organisations are not subject to tax on mutual receipts as a result of the Coleambally Federal Court decision handed down on 7 September 2004.</para>
<para class="block">Under the mutuality principle, membership subscriptions and receipts from other mutual dealings with members are not liable for income tax. The Court’s decision, which held that the principle of mutuality cannot apply where an organisation is prevented from distributing to members, would potentially affect between 200,000 to 300,000 not-for-profit entities including clubs, professional organisations and some friendly societies. The Government’s amendment today restores the longstanding benefits of the mutuality principle that applied prior to the Coleambally decision.</para>
<para class="block">Further refinement to the consolidation regime is contained in this bill. The amendment ensures the method for calculating the rate at which the head company of a consolidated group can recoup a joining entity’s losses, operates as intended. It allows consolidated groups to round the available fraction for a bundle of losses to the first non-zero digit, if rounding to three decimal places would result in an available fraction of nil. The amendment improves the consolidation regime by ensuring that the available fraction rounding rules do not prevent consolidated groups from being able to deduct losses held by a joining entity at the joining time.</para>
<para class="block">Also, this bill amends the lists of deductible gift recipients in the Income Tax Assessment Act 1997. Deductible gift recipient status will assist the listed organisations to attract public support for their activities.</para>
<para class="block">Finally amendments are made to the medical expenses offset to ensure that solely cosmetic procedures are no longer eligible expenses for the purposes of this offset. Specifically, solely cosmetic procedures are excluded from the medical expenses offset under two broad categories: general medical expenses and general dental expenses.</para>

<quote>
<para class="block">Infrastructure facilities play an important role in Australia’s economic and social development. The efficient use of, and continued investment in, facilities such as natural gas pipelines and rail tracks are of strategic importance to the nation.</para>
<para class="block">Accordingly, the Government’s policy is to assist realising the potential contribution of such services to economic growth and the improved well-being of all Australians.</para>
<para class="block">The Exports and Infrastructure Taskforce report, provided to the Prime Minister in May 2005, highlighted the need for improvements to the regulation of access to services provided through export-related infrastructure facilities.</para>
<para class="block">Much of the work to be done in addressing the recommendations of the report will require the cooperation and action of state and territory governments.</para>
<para class="block">Most recently, the importance of jurisdictional cooperation in the area of infrastructure regulation has been recognised in the new National Reform Agenda, agreed by the Council of Australian Governments on 10 February 2006. As part of a new broad-ranging reform initiative, COAG has agreed to a simpler and consistent national system of economic regulation for nationally-significant infrastructure, including for ports, railways and other export-related infrastructure.</para>
<para class="block">The initiatives contained in this bill reflect recommendations by the Productivity Commission. Importantly, they are consistent not only with the recommendations of the Export and Infrastructure Taskforce report, but also with the underlying principles governing infrastructure regulation that have been agreed to by COAG.</para>
<para class="block">This bill will make an important contribution to promoting timely and efficient infrastructure investment decisions and outcomes, through an improved National Access Regime for infrastructure facilities of national significance.</para>
<para class="block">By way of background, following recommendations of the Report on National Competition Policy by the Hilmer Committee —in 1995 —the Commonwealth and state and territory governments agreed to implement a National Competition Policy package.</para>
<para class="block">The package contained a range of measures to increase competition across the economy and thereby enhance economic performance. The National Access Regime is part of the NCP package.</para>
<para class="block">The National Access Regime comprises two key components: a legislative framework contained in Part IIIA of the Trade Practices Act 1974, and Clause 6 of the 1995 Competition Principles Agreement, negotiated between the Commonwealth, state and territory governments.</para>
<para class="block">Under Part IIIA, businesses can seek access to strategically important infrastructure services on reasonable terms and conditions.</para>
<para class="block">This access can be sought in cases where replicating the infrastructure concerned would not be economically feasible, and where commercial negotiation with the infrastructure owner or operator has failed. This ensures that facilities with natural monopoly characteristics do not create barriers to competition.</para>
<para class="block">Access provided under Part IIIA promotes competition in upstream and downstream markets, which is essential for sustaining strong economic growth and job creation, and contributes significantly to efficiencies and innovation.</para>
<para class="block">Clause 6 of the Competition Principles Agreement sets out principles for assessing the effectiveness of a state and territory access regime, for the purposes of determining whether the National Access Regime should apply to services provided by means of a facility covered by that regime.</para>
<para class="block">The National Access Regime establishes three pathways available for an access seeker to gain access to a strategically important infrastructure service:</para>
<list type="decimal">
<item label="(1)">
<para>by having a service declared so that the access seeker has the right to initiate negotiations with the service provider;</para>
</item>
<item label="(2)">
<para>by seeking access through an effective industry-specific regime, or</para>
</item>
<item label="(3)">
<para>by seeking access under the terms and conditions specified in a registered undertaking from the service provider.</para>
</item>
</list>
<para class="block">In October 2000, the Commonwealth Government requested that the Productivity Commission inquire into the operation of the National Access Regime —specifically, clause 6 of the Competition Principles Agreement, and the legislation contained in Part IIIA of the Trade Practices Act 1974.</para>
<para class="block">In its report, the Commission made 33 recommendations for improvements to the National Access Regime.</para>
<para class="block">The Government’s response to the Commission’s report accepted almost all of the Commission’s recommendations, and the Trade Practices Amendment (National Access Regime) Bill 2006 implements that response.</para>
<para class="block">The key changes contained in the bill aim to clarify the Regime’s objectives and scope, encourage efficient investment in new infrastructure, strengthen incentives for commercial negotiation and improve the certainty, transparency and accountability of regulatory processes.</para>
<para class="block">These changes provide a balance between ensuring a means for business to gain access to nationally significant infrastructure, while providing incentives for new investment.</para>
<para class="block">The changes are also designed to provide access seekers and investors with greater confidence and certainty about the regulatory framework to enable them to make well-informed decisions.</para>
<para class="block">The major initiatives contained in the bill are as follows.</para>
<para class="block">
<inline font-weight="bold">Clarifying the objectives of the regime</inline>
</para>
<para class="block">The bill will insert a new objects clause in Part IIIA in order to provide greater certainty for infrastructure owners, access seekers, investors and other interested parties.</para>
<para class="block">The objects clause emphasises the need for Part IIIA decisions to promote competition by promoting the economically efficient operation and use of investment in infrastructure.</para>
<para class="block">It also highlights the important role played by Part IIIA in terms of providing a framework for access regulation applying to specific industries.</para>
<para class="block">Decision-makers under Part IIIA will be required to have regard to the objects clause when making their respective decisions.</para>
<para class="block">The implementation of an objects clause will promote consistency and provide guidance in the decision-making process and in the application of Part IIIA, which in turn will enhance regulatory accountability.</para>
<para class="block">
<inline font-weight="bold">Encouraging efficient investment</inline>
</para>
<para class="block">The bill specifies pricing principles that are relevant to the price of access to a service; and that are designed to guide regulatory decision makers.</para>
<para class="block">In its review of the National Access Regime, the Productivity Commission recommended that statutory pricing principles should be established and applicable to all three access pathways under the National Access Regime.</para>
<para class="block">The introduction of pricing principles should achieve a number of important objectives.</para>
<para class="block">They will provide guidance on how the broad objectives of access regimes should be applied in setting terms and conditions.</para>
<para class="block">The pricing principles will provide additional certainty to regulated firms and access seekers, in turn improving the operation of the negotiation-arbitration framework.</para>
<para class="block">Further, pricing principles will provide some guidance for approaches adopted in industry regimes.</para>
<para class="block">Finally, the pricing principles will help to address concerns that a regulator’s own values will unduly influence decisions relating to the terms and conditions of access.</para>
<para class="block">The Government has accepted the recommendation of the Senate Economics Legislation Committee, which reported on 8 September 2005 that pricing principles should be included in the bill specifically, rather than in a legislative instrument.</para>
<para class="block">The Committee concluded that the pricing principles were not controversial —with strong support by industry —and having them introduced in the bill would enhance certainty and transparency for investors and access seekers alike.</para>
<para class="block">Minor amendments to the original Bill were moved in the House of Representatives giving full effect to the Committee’s recommendation.</para>
<para class="block">Importantly, the Senate Economics Legislation Committee recommended that the Senate pass the bill once this change was made.</para>
<para class="block">The Australian Competition and Consumer Commission —the ACCC —will be required to have regard to the pricing principles in making a final arbitration determination, and in deciding whether or not to accept an access undertaking or access code.</para>
<para class="block">On review, the Australian Competition Tribunal will also be required to take the pricing principles into account where the Tribunal is required to reconsider a decision of the ACCC.</para>
<para class="block">Furthermore, in using the principles, decision makers will be required to have regard to the pricing principles ‘as a whole’, rather than requiring each and every principle to be satisfied.</para>
<para class="block">As part of the new Competition and Infrastructure Reform Agreement signed by COAG on 10 February 2006, the States and Territories have committed to including the same pricing principles in all access regimes for significant infrastructure facilities. This will promote consistency and greater certainty in access regulation for industry.</para>
<para class="block">The bill also establishes a framework for the granting of immunity from declaration for new infrastructure projects that are to be developed subject to a competitive tendering process.</para>
<para class="block">A competitive tendering process is likely to see any monopoly rents expected to attach to the facilities concerned dissipated in more favourable terms and conditions for service users, rather than accruing to the service provider.</para>
<para class="block">This obviates the need for declaration.</para>
<para class="block">The bill will include a new Division 2B which sets out the process by which the ACCC will assess whether a tender should confer immunity from declaration.</para>
<para class="block">By establishing statutory criteria for the tendering process, the bill provides additional regulatory certainty for government-sponsored investment in infrastructure that is likely to benefit the economy and enhance community well-being overall.</para>
<para class="block">The ACCC will have the power to revoke its approval if it transpires that the assessment of tenders was not in accordance with the tender process, or the service provider concerned is not complying with the terms and conditions of access to the service.</para>
<para class="block">The threat of revocation acts to safeguard the interests of access seekers if the terms and conditions are not reasonable in practice.</para>
<para class="block">
<inline font-weight="bold">Enhancing the access regime</inline>
</para>
<para class="block">The Government is introducing a number of refinements to enhance the effectiveness of the National Access Regime.</para>
<para class="block">The declaration criteria under the current regime preclude declaration of a service where the relevant infrastructure and subsequent potential public benefits are not significant.</para>
<para class="block">However, as identified by the Productivity Commission, the current declaration criteria do not sufficiently address the situation where, irrespective of the significance of the infrastructure, a declaration would result in only marginal increases in competition.</para>
<para class="block">The bill amends Part IIIA so that declaration of a service cannot be recommended unless access to the particular service would promote a material increase in at least one market other than the market for the service.</para>
<para class="block">The bill also enables an access provider to lodge an undertaking after a service has been declared.</para>
<para class="block">This will provide a means of achieving certainty on access terms and conditions, thereby facilitating negotiations between access providers and access seekers.</para>
<para class="block">The bill also makes explicit certain arrangements regarding the powers of the ACCC.</para>
<para class="block">For example, the ACCC will be prevented from accepting an access undertaking if the service concerned is already subject to a state or territory access regime that has been certified as an effective regime under Part IIIA.</para>
<para class="block">The bill also makes explicit that when arbitrating a dispute for a declared service, the ACCC can require a service provider to permit interconnection to its facility by an access seeker.</para>
<para class="block">The bill also clarifies and enhances the ACCC’s existing powers when arbitrating access disputes.</para>
<para class="block">For example, when arbitrating a dispute over access terms and conditions, the ACCC will be required to limit its involvement to matters in dispute between the parties.</para>
<para class="block">It will be empowered to conduct multilateral arbitrations following consultations with relevant parties.</para>
<para class="block">The ACCC will also be required to publish reports addressing specific matters following completion of an arbitration, provided that the published material will not disclose commercially confidential information.</para>
<para class="block">Improving the transparency, accountability and timeliness of the regime</para>
<para class="block">The bill implements a number of measures designed to enhance the transparency, accountability and timeliness of the decision-making processes in Part IIIA.</para>
<para class="block">The bill requires Part IIIA decision makers —such as Ministers, the National Competition Council and the ACCC —to publish reasons for their decisions or recommendations. These would relate to all access routes provided for under the regime: declarations; certifications; and proposed undertakings.</para>
<para class="block">These amendments will enhance procedural transparency and regulatory accountability. They will also help facilitate informed consideration of whether grounds exist to challenge a decision, by way of merit review before the Tribunal or judicial review by the courts.</para>
<para class="block">The bill seeks to improve the accountability of decision makers under the regime by introducing non-binding target time limits to various decision-making processes under Part IIIA.</para>
<para class="block">If the National Competition Council, the ACCC or the Australian Competition Tribunal cannot meet a specified target time limit, the provisions require the party concerned to extend the period and publish notification to that effect in a national newspaper.</para>
<para class="block">In this way, the target time limits should increase incentives for timely decision making, without compromising the rigour of the decision-making process.</para>
<para class="block">The bill also provides discretion to the ACCC to grant interim arbitration determinations, which will not be subject to merit review by the Tribunal, and to backdate final determinations to the date negotiations commenced between the access provider and access seeker. Such changes will also assist in encouraging timely decision making.</para>
<para class="block">This bill provides for public input on specific regulatory decision processes under Part IIIA, where it is reasonable and practicable to seek such input. This would cover, for instance, declaration and certification applications, proposed access undertakings, and access codes.</para>
<para class="block">Public input into the regime’s decision-making processes will enhance informed decision making, particularly when assessing the public interest in each case.</para>
<para class="block">The bill also establishes mechanisms to streamline the extension of a certification or undertaking, prior to its expiry, which should benefit a wide range of stakeholders.</para>
<para class="block">For example, infrastructure service providers will be given the opportunity to avoid potential regulatory uncertainty and delay. Access seekers will also benefit, as the process will expedite regulatory certainty in relation to the terms and conditions governing access to the service.</para>
<para class="block">Finally, the bill contains an important new reporting requirement, as the National Competition Council will be required to report annually on the operation and effects of the regime.</para>
<para class="block">This will provide an opportunity to reflect on the developments that have occurred in the preceding 12 month period, and to consider changes which may further improve the effectiveness of the regime.</para>
<para class="block">
<inline font-weight="bold">Conclusion</inline>
</para>
<para class="block">In conclusion, the changes to the National Access Regime in this bill will provide access seekers and infrastructure investors with greater confidence and certainty about the regulatory framework.</para>
<para class="block">This will allow informed decisions to be made, and ensure that the National Access Regime will continue to play an important role in Australia’s economic and social development.</para>
<para class="block">I note that, following minor amendments to the bill made by the Government in the House, the bill has the full endorsement of the Senate Economics Legislation Committee.</para>
<para class="block">I commend the bill to the Senate.</para>

</talker>
<para>—I would just like to make a few remarks on this very significant piece of legislation, the <inline ref="R2492">Future Fund Bill 2005</inline>. Firstly, I would like to thank all senators who have contributed to a constructive and good discussion of what is a vital piece of legislation. On behalf of the government, I do appreciate the general support for the policy direction the government is setting in relation to this matter and to the policy intent behind it. I also want to make special reference to the Economics Legislation Committee, especially the chair, Senator Brandis, and the deputy chair, Senator Stephens, for what I think is a good report on this legislation. I thank them for the work they and the committee have done in thoroughly examining it.</para>
</talk.start>
<para>From the government’s point of view, this is one of our most significant initiatives in this term of government. It was something we took to the Australian people at the last federal election. It was our undertaking and commitment to the Australian people to establish this very important fund as part of our concern about future financing of obligations entered into by previous Australian governments. I think the fund itself in general terms does have wide community support. I think the only criticism, if any, has come from some groups who suggest that the establishment of this fund may come at the expense of future tax cuts and/or infrastructure spending. I think that is a misreading of the government’s approach to this fund.</para>
<para>We have made it abundantly clear on numerous occasions that decisions as to the direction of funds into the Future Fund will come after all appropriate budgetary decisions are made. It would be for the government of the day to properly and appropriately make its budgetary decisions on the level of taxation and the nature of the taxation required to meet its expenditure obligations and to make decisions on expenditure, including any it wants to make on infrastructure. Then, as a residual of those decisions, surplus funds that may exist in relation to the budget would be deposited into the Future Fund. Therefore, we reject out of hand any suggestion that government decision making in relation to appropriate levels of taxation or infrastructure spending would be compromised by the Future Fund. That is simply not the case and misunderstands the way this fund will operate.</para>
<para>I should also say that, while I welcome the opposition’s general support for the direction that we are taking and the opposition’s acceptance that it is appropriate for the government to seek to provide for its legal obligations to former public servants through the establishment of this fund, we are not in a position to support the second reading amendment that the Labor Party has proposed. I particularly want to say that I am disturbed by the Labor Party’s continued support for the proposition that earnings of the fund be taken away from the fund and used for other purposes. If I can be as generous as possible and accept that the ALP is genuinely interested in infrastructure spending, nevertheless, as I said, I think governments should appropriately make those decisions as part of the normal budget process.</para>
<para>When it comes to funds deposited in the fund, it is critical that the fund is able to retain its earnings if it is to have any hope at all of meeting what we believe will be a $140 billion obligation with respect to public sector superannuation. So to strip the fund of its capacity to retain and reinvest its earnings would be extraordinarily detrimental to the whole purpose of this fund. As I say, albeit that one day there should be a future Labor government, it is for that government, in my view and in our government’s view, to make decisions about infrastructure spending as part of its budget process and not pervert or damage the Future Fund’s capacity to meet these obligations. I therefore give notice that we would not be in a position to support the second reading amendment. There are amendments being moved to the bill by the Democrats, and I am happy to deal with them in the committee stage.</para>

<para class="block">I motivated during my speech on the second reading the consistent—and, hopefully, it will be persistent—line we have taken with respect to investment funds, which is that they essentially act on trust for others, either investors or beneficiaries or both. Where those investments are made, therefore, in our view their holdings are often subject to the principles that surround escrow. That to us means that investment funds should invariably exercise a determination to vote their shares in the companies and entities in which they have an investment. That is a view that is very widely held, and there are those, including me I might say, who think that such institutions should vote on all issues and all resolutions.</para>
<para>The key difference between those who believe that institutions should vote is often over the question of mandating. Although I believe that institutions should vote on all resolutions, I recognise that not all institutions have invested in or have the capacity of professional analysis. I think that that is to their discredit because on a cost-saving basis they have often got relatively weak analytical departments and tend to run on a particular assessment rather than holistic assessment. Leaving that observation aside, I have argued through the CLERP 9 process and elsewhere that voting should be mandated with respect to a number of key and critical issues simply because those shares are held on trust essentially for others, either beneficiaries or investors.</para>
<para>I have limited a motivation for a mandated activity to the three matters which I think are most germane and most pertinent to those with an interest in the corporation or the entity concerned—that is, any resolution which affects the constitution of a company; secondly, any resolution which affects the election of directors, because they are the people who run the company; and, thirdly, matters relating to the remuneration of directors of the company because that overall package is amongst the most controversial of all. We are moving here to require the responsible minister to include in the direction a mandatory requirement for the board or its members when considering a material corporate governance matter in relation to a company to vote on the matters we have outlined there.</para>
<para>Of course I recognise that it is probably within the broadest interpretation of the bill, soon to become an act, I guess, for the minister to indeed make such a determination. But, firstly, there is no guarantee that the minister will, particularly if they have a laissez-faire approach to the market, and, secondly, even if one minister will, there is no guarantee that a future minister would abide by that view if the board came to a different view. I think you are safer to put this into legislation, and that is what I have attempted to do. I can motivate it further if there are questions, but I think the amendment is plain on its face. It has had to be designed rather rapidly. As you are aware, Minister, the report came down last night. There was not a great deal of time to put this together, so my apologies to the chamber for it only being circulated today. I had no option, given the timing.</para>

<para>—The Labor Party will be supporting the amendment moved by Senator Murray on this occasion. I know Senator Murray has moved similar types of amendments on other occasions, so it should not be taken as an indication of automatic support for the same, or similar, amendments in other pieces of legislation. One of the interesting aspects of this legislation, which I know the Senate Economics Legislation Committee examined fairly extensively during the inquiry, is the governance arrangements of the Future Fund board, the so-called board of guardians.</para>
</talk.start>
<para>That was the main focus of the committee inquiry, because the governance arrangements of the proposed Future Fund are not as were announced as policy by the government in the 2004 election. We were assured of a fully and totally independent board, but the legislation provides for a direction of investment mandate by a collection of ministerial directions which can be made to the board regarding the investment of the funds. So ministers, the Treasurer and the finance minister in this case, have the power to direct. Goodness knows what would happen if we ever had a National Party finance minister. I do not think we are ever likely to—Senator McGauran, perhaps. He can live in hope of a promotion to finance one day. But goodness knows what would happen if we had a National Party minister directing.</para>

<para>—It would be very interesting times indeed with this sort of power. That is clearly not arm’s length and totally independent with a general principled investment mandate enshrined in legislation if ministers—in this case, the finance minister and the Treasurer—are given the power of issuing the investment mandate and varying it from time to time. Critically, it is not disallowable by parliament either, so it is even worse.</para>
</talk.start>
</continue>
<para>I have used the trustee analogy time and time again because I believe it is the relevant analogy of comparison. No government in this country has the power to direct, in any way, shape or form, trustees of superannuation funds in this country. It has no power to do so—and it should not. There is a general principle, a prudent-person principle, which is: diversify investment commensurate with safety, effectively treat it as your own money in the sense of investing it safely and securely and in a well-balanced way. I think having the prudent-person test enshrined in law has been one of the great strengths of the Australian trustee system in respect of superannuation governance. We have avoided—and I think it is very important that we avoid, for a whole range of reasons—the potential of any government dabbling in the investment direction of a superannuation fund. What do we get? The one exception to this rule in Australia is to be the Future Fund, which is intended, according to the government’s claims, to pay accrued superannuation liabilities in defined benefit pension funds for public servants.</para>
<para>Why do we have just this one particular body accruing assets subject to ministerial direction? Labor believes that is inappropriate and that it should not be permitted. It was not what was announced in at the 2004 election. Those directions are not even subject to disallowance, so there can no discussion. That confers enormous power of investment direction on those two ministers. That is not a personal critique of Senator Minchin or even the current Treasurer, Mr Costello. I am not particularly reflecting on them as individuals; I do not want to do that. But it confers enormous power on the holders of that office to directly impact on a range of investment decisions in which those moneys are held.</para>

<para>—Yes, and great temptation, Senator Murray. I agree with you. The current government may come to regret that power being conferred at some future date. But that is the provision in the bill. That is what will pass this parliament. In those circumstances it raises a number of quite legitimate governance issues. Ministers directly—they may do this directly—or the Future Fund board may be called upon to make a judgment. In those circumstances, the very special and unique circumstances in relation to the Future Fund, this amendment is appropriate—good governance, good corporate governance, and applying the principles that Senator Murray has outlined. I give him full marks for consistency. He has argued this in a range of other areas. Labor believes that the principles that have been outlined in this amendment by Senator Murray deserve support in respect of this particular arrangement.</para>

<para>—I am not sure. We had an interesting discussion at Senate estimates about the legal common law meaning of a guardian in the Australian context. I think Senator Brandis referred to one commonly understood definition that a guardian holds a legal power or authority over a minor or a person who is mentally impaired. When I heard the term ‘guardian’, it conjured up visions of <inline font-style="italic">Doctor Who</inline>. There are episodes of <inline font-style="italic">Doctor Who</inline> with these horrible creatures—I am not sure what sort of biological or mechanical creature they are—called guardians. Not daleks; guardians. We have this new terminology being brought into Australian finance governance. They are effectively trustees. We should call a spade a spade and call them trustees. I think this is an invention by an imaginative Treasurer to give it the imprimatur of something different when it clearly is not. It clearly is not different from the role or responsibility of a trustee, and there should not be this potential for ministerial interference on investment mandate.</para>

<para>I was reading an interesting paper on the Central Provident Fund of Singapore, which has been established with a contribution I think around the 40 per cent level. It is a truly massive fund. It is a bit like the Future Fund, only established a lot earlier and a lot bigger. Obviously, it is forced collection of savings meant for the retirement income purposes of Singapore citizens. I do not have any disagreement with that in principle. I will probably get a wrap over the knuckles from the Singapore ambassador about this, but the Singapore government, through its fund—and there is the potential for this in this Future Fund because of the ministerial direction—de facto controls the Singapore economy through the investment mandate. It directs the economy. It directs investment into a whole range of business enterprises that are owned, either outright or partly, and controlled by investment direction by the Singapore government through the Singapore provident fund.</para>

<para>—Perhaps. I understand, though, that Singapore is probably the best example anywhere in the world of a command socialist economy. I am not suggesting that Senator Minchin or the current Treasurer would go that far, but there is potential with these directive powers for future ministers or governments to start exercising the sorts of authority of investment decisions. In Singapore, the government can literally turn off investment and redirect the entire economy, and it has done that on occasions in some sectors of the economy of Singapore. Senator Murray, we support your amendment. It is appropriate on this occasion.</para>

<para>I have one question for the minister. He emphasised in his speech on the second reading that the Future Fund would retain all earnings, and he made some criticisms of Labor in this regard. He might give an assurance to the parliament. Will it retain all the earnings when an actuarial surplus has been identified in the fund, if in fact that occurs? I think it is highly likely. If an actuarial surplus is identified in the fund after the actuarial assessment, whenever that occurs, and it shows that it has accrued assets at a greater rate than otherwise projected, will all of the earnings be retained in the fund? That is a question for the minister. I conclude my comments on amendment R(1).</para>

<para>—I will respond to the Democrat amendment, and in so doing I will pick up a couple of points made by Senator Sherry. I note his reflections upon Singapore. I will not go down that path for fear, as he said, of offending anybody, but I can assure the Senate that while we, of course, did undertake a study of the Singapore fund, it is not the model upon which this fund is based. New Zealand provides a much better model and the one that ours would be more closely aligned to. I visited New Zealand late last year and had a number of useful meetings with New Zealand officials, including the very capable New Zealand finance minister, to discuss the operation of the New Zealand fund. Without wanting to detract from the initiative taken by Mr Costello, the name ‘guardian’ is in fact the name used by the New Zealand fund. We are very impressed with the way the New Zealand fund operates and its structure, and we thought therefore that that terminology was more than appropriate for our fund. I will obtain a response to Senator Sherry’s question on the possibility of the fund ending up with more funds than are required to meet its obligations with respect to the superannuation liability.</para>
</talk.start>
<para>Senator Sherry seemed to be suggesting that the independence of the board is the vital thing and that it is wrong for us to even have the legislative authority to provide, through the executive, for an investment mandate. On the other hand, he supports the Murray amendment, which is a somewhat interventionist amendment directing by legislation the government to direct the fund as to what it should do in relation to shares that it holds. I find that, at least on the face of it, a somewhat contradictory position.</para>
<para>We have tried to approach this issue quite genuinely and objectively. On the one hand, we very much want this board to be and to be seen to be independent of the government of the day. I therefore take to heart what Senator Sherry has said on this matter. That is critical, and I think we share that objective. On the other hand, we must reflect on the fact that the board will have responsibility for a large amount of taxpayers’ funds. They are not trustees in the traditional sense of the word because it is not, strictly speaking, a superannuation fund; it is an investment fund. It so happens that the government itself will use the fund to meet its obligations with respect to public sector superannuation. But the fund itself is an investment fund, not a superannuation fund.</para>
<para>Given the very significant responsibility which we are entrusting to this board, we believe that it is appropriate to have this obligation on the ministers—the Treasurer and the finance minister—to set the investment mandate. That is something which, by law, we are required to consult with the board on. If there is any change to the investment mandate, that requires consultation with the board. Something that Mr David Murray—whom we have appointed as chairman and whose appointment has been widely praised—felt strongly about was that the board must be able to publicly state its position with respect to any proposed change to the mandate, that it must be free to publicly express its view and that it should be free to say so if it believes that the government of the day is requiring it to act contrary to its obligations to maximise returns and minimise risk.</para>
<para>We are genuinely attempting to get the balance right. I certainly hope that we will never face the day when a future government seeks to improperly use what we believe is an appropriate authority with regard to the mandate. We have provided in the legislation for the board to be able to have a very public position on that matter, and I believe the court of public opinion would restrain appropriately any government abusing that investment mandate authority. I make the point that we have already said what we propose to be the initial mandate. I think the flavour of our announcement reflects the very broad approach that we are taking to this question. In no way do we seek to interfere with the day-to-day operation of the fund or to direct it unduly.</para>
<para>The four points that comprise the proposed mandate for the initial operation of this board are: that it should seek a long-term benchmark for real rates of return of between 4½ per cent and 5½ per cent, so setting a target return; that the government for its part accepts that there will obviously be some short-term volatility in achieving those longer-term returns; that, subject to those targeted terms, the board should obviously seek to minimise the probability of losses; and, quite properly, that the board should have regard to the impact of its activities on the reputation of the government of Australia in domestic and international markets. That is clearly a broad but appropriate mandate. The board needs that sort of guidance from the government as to how it should operate but, within that broad framework, it has total independence.</para>
<para>Coming to the specifics of the Murray amendment, by way of introduction to my remarks I say that we are cognisant of the goodwill that Senator Murray brings to this debate with his proper and legitimate concern for good corporate governance. He makes a very constructive contribution to this parliament in his concern for that matter. But we think that in the case of the fund, and reflecting upon the appropriate degree of independence that this board must have and must be seen to have, this amendment just goes too far. It proposes that, by legislation, the parliament should force the government to force this board to vote its shares on all corporate governance issues that come up at AGMs of companies in which this fund is an investor. We do not think that is appropriate.</para>
<para>It is, of course, true—as Senator Sherry noted—that a future government could seek to amend the mandate in the way I have described, by a very public process, to provide that within the mandate from the Treasurer and the finance minister that these matters should be taken account of. But we do not believe it is appropriate to have this as a legislative fiat to force governments to direct the board in this way. I must say—and I do not mean these remarks to in any sense amount to guidance to the board and simply say this objectively—that it would not surprise me if the board did indeed exercise its rights and its authority with regard to shares it held in various companies to vote on these matters. That would not surprise me at all.</para>
<para>In terms of our proper regard for the independence of the board and our respect for the board—which I think I can safely assure the Senate will be a very high-quality board—it is inappropriate for the parliament, via this amendment, to force the government to force the board to act in this way. I think it much better that the board be seen to reach its own views on these matters, by virtue of its own cognisance of the importance of corporate governance in its operations, and to come to those decisions of its own accord without having absolutely no choice in the matter as a matter of legislative fiat. Therefore, the government, while respectful of Senator Murray’s intent, does not believe it appropriate that the bill be amended in this fashion.</para>

<para>—I will not add to the debate at any length because, on their face, the views of the various participants are clear. But there was a slightly cute point made by the minister in response to Senator Sherry. That was that he thought it passing strange—that is not the phrase he used but my interpretation of it—that Senator Sherry would be concerned about excessive government interference and intervention in the market and, at the same time, be supporting this amendment.</para>
</talk.start>
<para>In fact, the bill already requires—and I think properly so—the government to be specific to the board about what it must do. Item 24(1)(a) to (e) does require the board to produce material, policies and an approach which will result in a specific attitude to market performance and behaviour by the fund. But the key point, of course, is that this amendment does not tell the board how to vote. They can vote for or against. It simply says they must vote in these three material matters.</para>
<para>I would buy the minister’s argument a little more if, in fact, the record of investment funds and investment managers was a good one with respect to participation in voting in company resolutions. But my recall of the data on voting by institutions is that it is the minority and not the majority, and most investment funds and directors have a history of delinquency with respect to exercising their duties in escrow. That is why I have felt obliged to put this amendment forward—because you cannot rely on boards based on their past history and past performance to vote. In my view they should be required to vote because they hold these investments in escrow. However, the minister has made the government’s views clear. I think they are wrong, they think I am wrong and hopefully the board will turn out to be an exemplary board and will always vote in these matters. I do hope that I will have the energy and time—and hopefully Senator Sherry will—to regularly ask the minister questions when they fail to vote in these matters.</para>

In other words, so that it is not a backroom determination which lacks the appropriate accountability and process which we think are required in these matters.</para>
<para>In making these remarks I am fully aware that governments of all persuasions have in the past made some absolutely outstanding appointments to statutory authorities and to various agencies and regulatory bodies in what might be described as a backroom process. But there has also been, in my view, some appalling appointments made which do no credit to the government or the ministers concerned. In making those remarks I make no inference or reflection on anybody who is engaged in this debate. This essentially is an accountability and probity amendment. We have moved it before. No doubt we will have to move it again in the future. We think it is appropriate as a protective prudential mechanism with respect to the proposed appointment of board members to the Future Fund.</para>

<para>—I indicate again that, on this occasion, because of the circumstances of the Future Fund legislation that is before us, Labor will be supporting the amendments moved by Senator Murray. Again, this issue has been fairly significantly canvassed at Senate estimates. The approach of the government is business as usual. Despite the fact that the government claims that the Future Fund will be independent and at arm’s length and despite the fact that this fund will ultimately accrue over $100 billion in assets, it is business as usual as far as the government is concerned when it comes to appointments to this board. That is not good enough. We are not dealing here with an everyday statutory authority; this Future Fund will have truly enormous assets under management. It will become very quickly, if not almost immediately, larger than any superannuation fund in the country. The implications of this are very significant, yet the government comes into the other place and says, ‘As far as the selection of board members goes, it is business as usual.’ That is not appropriate in these circumstances.</para>
</talk.start>
<para>For those who are not aware of the process, the Minister for Finance and Administration, Senator Minchin, and the Treasurer, Mr Costello, will gather names and will then appoint whomever they like, subject to their decision being ratified by cabinet. They will just appoint whomever they like. That is the way it works at the present time. I am not saying that that is inappropriate in other circumstances, but Labor argue very strongly that it is very inappropriate in respect of the Future Fund and it is not what the government committed to and promised in the election campaign last year. The closest analogy is superannuation fund practice in this country. At the present time, the prudential regulator, APRA, which this government established, is going through the background of every trustee—the independent guardians, if you like, of superannuation funds in this country—checking them and relicensing superannuation fund trustee boards. Amongst other things, it is applying the fit and proper person test. The government is not even going to apply a fit and proper person test to check the backgrounds of the individuals that it proposes to appoint to the Future Fund board. It will not even go that far.</para>
<para>It seems to me that, if you wanted to look at a model that involves a greater level of both scrutiny and probity in appointment to a body such as this, you would say, ‘All of the applicants will be subject to a background check by APRA, the prudential regulator.’ Let them carry out the check as to whether they are a fit and proper person and the other range of checks that are carried out on trustees. At least ask them to do that, but that is not going to happen. At the end of the day, we are told in estimates that the check will be that as carried out by the Minister for Finance and Administration or the Treasurer and their offices. That is what goes when it comes to the appointment of members to this board. Labor does not believe that that is good enough, given the Future Fund’s massive asset holding and the comparable practice with regard to superannuation trustees, which is the closest comparison and practice in this country.</para>
<para>The minister himself raises the future fund and the guardians in New Zealand. Apparently, New Zealand inspired the Treasurer. It is interesting. In New Zealand, even the New Zealand Labour government recognised that they could not get away with business as usual when it came to board appointments to their future fund over there. It is quite instructive to look at what occurs in New Zealand. I do not necessarily agree with this model, but it is better than business as usual here whereby the minister just ticks the names off in his or her office. Goodness knows what criteria they use. In New Zealand, in appointing members to the future fund board, the minister’s recommendations follow nominations from an independent nominating committee. We have not got that in Australia. On receiving those nominations, the minister must consult with representatives of other political parties in parliament before recommending to the Governor-General who to appoint to the board.</para>
<para>Even New Zealand has departed from the norm when it comes to making appointments to its future fund board, but this government does not. It just wants business as usual. There may be very well qualified people appointed. I will have a look at the names, but we remember Mr Gerard. I do not want to badger the poor fellow, but he had a tax problem with his company apparently in the form of tax havens overseas in a couple of the Caribbean islands. Surprise, surprise! He also donated $1 million to the Liberal Party and ended up on the Reserve Bank board. On that occasion, the Treasurer was responsible. Given the importance of the Future Fund board, the current method of appointment does not pass any reasonable test of any attempt at any level to be independent and at arm’s length and there is no scrutiny of the proposed members of the board.</para>
<para>Senator Minchin can assure us all he likes about how fantastic they will be, and we will look at the names at the time. But even Senator Minchin cannot assure us that there has not been some particular problem in the past. They may not find out about it. The minister’s office just asking through the old boy network of the Liberal Party to do a check on particular individuals is not an effective way to check on their backgrounds.</para>
<para>There are a range of models for appointment that can be looked at. We thought about a number of different models that could be adopted to lift the appointment of board members to the standard which is appropriate. There are a number of different models, but we certainly think the model outlined by Senator Murray and the Democrats in their amendment is a significant improvement on the ‘anything goes’ approach that this government intends to take to the appointment of members to this board.</para>
<para>I think the Treasurer, Mr Costello, is a touch arrogant when it comes to these things. I can remember him when he appointed former senator Senator Short to the Eastern European Bank for Reconstruction and Development very arrogantly rejecting all the names from Treasury and saying, ‘I’ve got the right; I’ll appoint whom I like.’ That was his explanation to the House of Representatives in question time some years ago when asked about that appointment—arrogantly saying, ‘I’ll appoint whom I like.’</para>
<para>Senator Minchin, to give him credit, is a bit smarter than the Treasurer when it comes to this these sorts of appointments. I would have thought Senator Minchin could have convinced the Treasurer of the need for a more prudent, rigorous process of board appointments, just on this one government instrumentality. Of all the instrumentalities and boards we have, you would think that the approach to this area could have been the exception to the normal arrogant approach of the Treasurer, Mr Costello, of: ‘I’ll appoint whom I like. Don’t question me.’ That is his attitude when it comes to appointments. But, no, it is going to be business as usual. The Labor Party believe that is inappropriate in this case and we support the Democrat amendments as a consequence.</para>

<para>—I cannot let Senator Sherry’s remarks go without saying that I reject out of hand his use of this chamber to reflect on Mr Robert Gerard. I want to say for the record that Mr Robert Gerard is one of the most outstanding citizens of my state of South Australia, a man highly regarded right across the political and community spectrum who has been a generous benefactor of many organisations. I am actively involved in the Adelaide Zoo. Without Robert Gerard the Adelaide Zoo, the only non-government capital city zoo, would be in extraordinary difficulty. Mr Gerard is an outstanding human being who has broken no law but whose name, as a result of the rigour of the political process in this place, has been besmirched—I think quite unfairly. We wanted a leading manufacturer on the Reserve Bank board and one from a minor state, and that is why he was appointed. I hope that issue will not colour this discussion, which I would hope would be a constructive and sensible one.</para>
</talk.start>
<para>Again, I obviously respect the integrity with which Senator Murray brings this proposal to the parliament, but on balance we do not believe it an appropriate amendment to this bill and will not be supporting it. I make the point that we have introduced into the Future Fund legislation a specific clause, 38(3), which puts a legal obligation on the ministers concerned to be satisfied that anybody appointed to this board:</para>

<para>Indeed, to date we have been working very closely with Mr Murray, whose appointment as chairman, as I say, I think has been widely accepted as very good. I can assure you that Mr Murray will not want to serve with anyone on this board other than those of the highest integrity. He has made that clear to us, and we are working closely with him on formulating appropriate appointments to the board—appointments that will not, obviously, be considered until this legislation is signed into law. We are well down the track of considering appointments, and they are people of very high quality. We are doing this in close consultation with Mr Murray—that is, Mr David Murray.

We do operate in this country on the basis of ministerial accountability for appointments to boards of this kind.

<para>—My point, despite the interjections, is that, even if you were to set up such a mechanism, somebody has to appoint the independent board that is going to scrutinise all these things, and if it is a Scottish Labour government you see the results you get. So we recognise the potential disease to which Senator Murray refers. We think that that is more than adequately catered for, and the sort of path which he would go down is itself fraught with the risks that Scotland highlights. But I think this very debate does highlight for our government and any future government the considerable care that must be taken and must be seen to be taken in the appointment of board members, and I assure this parliament and the people of Australia that due care will be taken.</para>

<para>—Minister, you make a good point, of course. There never has been a net made through which a fish has not been able to swim. I recognise that point, and those who have been watching the British press recently will know that the Prime Minister in waiting, Mr Gordon Brown, is in fact making something of a case for further improvements to the method of appointments, given concern throughout the United Kingdom that it is still not what it should be. But the point is that the British did try to address it. They did create for Westminster a Commissioner for Public Appointments, which was independent. But, coming back to the real nub of the issue: whether you accept this amendment or not—and you choose not to—the next point you made was a really important one; that is, the onus on you in your capacity as Minister for Finance and Administration, or whoever succeeds you, and the Treasurer to ensure that your advisers carefully check the candidates for the board is a vital one.</para>
</talk.start>
<para>It is very difficult in any walk of life—as anyone who has ever employed large numbers of people, as I have, would know—to be sure in every instance that those who claim a degree have that degree, that those who claim a particular background have that background or that people have not got an improper connection with tax havens, are not secret inside traders or are not people who have problems with the tax office. If the lessons of politics, life and business are ever to be noted, they are: to take care. The more important the appointment, the more care that must be taken. So although, Minister, you choose to reject this mechanism, which I think is an advance on our existing system, nevertheless I would urge you to check even those who on the face of it might be seen to be absolutely honourable, just to make doubly sure that they are, because of course it will come back and sting you if you do not.</para>

<para>—What concerns me about the minister’s approach is that, when we discussed this matter at estimates and I wanted an indication of what the checks—the process that would be undertaken—would be, he said: ‘We’ve got these criteria in the bill.’ That is fine. Labor has no argument about the criteria in the legislation. Presumably their officers will do something. It would be politically smart if they did, certainly if they went a little bit further than they did with the appointment of Mr Gerard.</para>
</talk.start>
<para>But let us just take the issue surrounding Mr Gerard. I do not want to overstate it but, at the moment, my understanding, on the government’s argument, is that you could not check the company tax activities of an individual that may be appointed to the Future Fund board. Government does not have the power, on its claims, to do that. I would have thought it would be smart to be able to do that and to have that in the legislation. We do not know whether the minister’s office or officers will check with the Federal Police. We do not know whether they will check with APRA, the regulator of financial institutions in this country. I am sure they have given some consideration to this. I am sure they have asked: ‘What level of checks will we carry out on the background of the people?’ I am sure the ministers have thought about how we check on these people.</para>
<para>So why won’t the minister outline whether there will be a Federal Police check, whether there will be a tax office check, including their company activities, or whether there will be a check with APRA? It seems to me that they are first base. If they come from overseas or they have had some overseas financial activity, will there be a check with the overseas financial regulators and authorities? It seems to me that they are all prudent things to do in respect of the background of the individuals for what is a unique and highly responsible institution. But the minister cannot outline what the checks will be other than just saying: ‘Trust us’ and ‘Business as usual. We’ll get an officer and go out and do a bit of a check.’ I think in the case of Mr Gerard it was a check of the newspaper clips. That is not an assurance that we can take at face value and that is not a vetting and checking procedure that Labor believes is appropriate.</para>

<para>—I note what was said and I can assure the Senate that rigorous and appropriate checking of backgrounds will be done, but I do not think we should subject these people to the public circus of sensationalism with regard to the nature of those checks. I think that is inappropriate. I would also just make the point, as it has been drawn to my attention by Senator Sherry’s earlier remarks about APRA and fit and proper person tests, that the government uses a similar process to appoint the employer representatives on the CSS-PSS board. Certainly, in the period of our government, we have made entirely appropriate and sensible appointments—and that is a very good board, one where due care is taken to ensure that it is a responsible and appropriate board. Interestingly, that board has to be licensed by APRA; indeed, the appointment process that we engage in with regard to that board has been accepted by APRA as complying with its requirements for licensing. That is why I do not believe we need to go down this unduly legislative path. The government applies itself diligently to its responsibilities in appointing employer reps for the CSS-PSS board, which has significant responsibilities. In the case of the Future Fund board, we will be taking at the very least the same rigorous approach as we do with the CSS-PSS board.</para>

<para>—I simply made the point that the CSS-PSS board is a superannuation fund and it has a responsibility for the funds invested by individuals as well as, of course, an overall responsibility. Therefore, it needs to be licensed, and therefore APRA needs to be satisfied with the process of appointments. APRA is about checking the methodologies, the processes and policies, of appointments.</para>
</talk.start>
<para>In the case of the Future Fund, it is not, as I said before, a superannuation fund in the same way that the CSS-PSS board is; it is an investment fund. We have charged it with the responsibility to invest wisely and sensibly moneys under its care. The government have separately made the decision that the funds held in that investment fund will be applied by the government as a matter of budgetary outlays to meeting our annual expenses with regard to public sector superannuation. So the two are different in that sense, albeit that, as I was saying, we will apply the same rigour to the appointment process. But I am not saying—and it will not be the case—that APRA will have that degree of involvement in the Future Fund board.</para>

<para>—We are in a public debate; we are not in the Senate committee inquiry. We have had at least part of this discussion before. The minister is splitting hairs when he claims that this is employer money to meet employer liabilities to a defined benefit fund debt. That is no different from a private sector defined benefit fund that has both employee contributions and employer contributions to meet the accrued liability of the fund and the moneys that will be paid out. It is absolutely no different. It begs the question, and this has been debated ad infinitum: why is the government actually setting up a separate fund? The money should have gone into the existing superannuation structures.</para>
</talk.start>
<para>Minister, you shake your head, but the law of the land in this country requires the employer to place their money in a superannuation fund in the same way as the government is placing its money in the Future Fund. The law of the land requires an employer to place into the superannuation fund their money, held in trust for the employees, alongside the employees’ money. Yet the government has chosen something different.</para>
<para>To come back to my point: given that very close analogy, we see no good reason why there should have been a departure from existing superannuation fund practice in this country. It is not the government’s money, Minister; it is actually the money that is going to belong to the superannuation fund members. It is not their money at the moment, legally, because you choose not to put it in the superannuation fund; you refuse to fund it. So the closest analogy is superannuation fund trustee law. That is what guardians are; they are trustees. And the most appropriate way to carry out at least some of the checks is through APRA. Why have we got APRA scouring and licensing every superannuation fund in the country and going back and checking all the trustees’ backgrounds? Why are they doing it? Exactly the same approach should apply to these so-called guardians, who are no more than superannuation fund trustees.</para>

<para>—I do not want to prolong this debate, but those remarks cannot go uncontested. I have explained ad nauseam, I think, in other forums, particularly estimates, why we are not putting this money into the CSS-PSS structure. I have made that clear. Senator Sherry clearly has still not got his head around what we are doing here. For 100 years, Australian governments have not funded their liabilities to former public servants’ superannuation. What happens is that the money is simply paid out through the budget each year. I think it is currently $7-odd billion, maybe $5 billion; I cannot remember the exact figure off the top of my head. Whatever it is, the reasonably substantial amounts that currently go out each year on public sector superannuation for former public servants come straight off the budget. That has been the case for 100 years.</para>
</talk.start>
<para>The Labor Party had 13 years in office to change that if they wanted to. They did not. Indeed, they were not able to because they were in deficit the whole time. They were essentially paying their public sector superannuation liabilities with borrowed money. We are in the much better position of having rescued the fiscal position of this country. We are now in a position where we have effectively paid off general government debt and we are now accumulating surplus funds. At the moment, they are held by the Reserve Bank. We have made the decision that, to the extent that in the near future we will be accumulating additional surplus funds—which is an appropriate consequence of our responsible fiscal policy—there will be, in all likelihood, proceeds of asset sales. These should be invested wisely for the nation’s future.</para>
<para>It so happens that we have made the decision that the best way to use this fund is to relieve the pressure on future budgets, because, as Senator Sherry knows, our <inline font-style="italic">Intergenerational report</inline> forecast that, without changes to existing policy parameters, the Australian government budget will go into chronic deficit from around the middle of the next decade. We are very conscious of that, and that is one of the reasons this fund has been created. What will happen in 2020 is that governments that succeed us will be in the blessed position of having their budgetary obligation to retired public servants eased by the fact that our government set up this fund. Those budgetary obligations can be met by drawing down on this fund which we are so wisely setting up.</para>
<para>I urge Senator Sherry to get his head around exactly what we are doing here. We are not setting up a superannuation fund per se; we are setting up a mechanism to relieve future governments of what will be a very difficult burden in the future, when they are under enormous fiscal pressure because of the ageing of the population, with respect to the legal obligations to pay superannuation for former public servants.</para>

<para>—I have one final point. If we follow the minister’s logic, we will be establishing a future fund to accrue assets to pay our age pension liabilities. That is the logic the minister is advancing—age pension liabilities. I put the question quite bluntly to the minister: is the government proposing to set up a future fund to accrue assets to cover age pension liabilities? I do not know what the current value of them is. It would be interesting to know, actually; I am sure it would be massively greater than the pension liabilities that have accrued in public sector super funds. But, if we follow your logic, Minister, that will be the next step. I would be interested to know whether the government is considering that.</para>

<para>—Before I get to that point—and, again, I do not want a long debate on this—I make the point that the current annual liability is around $4 billion, which has come straight out of the budget. The $7 billion to $8 billion to which I referred is our actuarial estimation of the cost of public sector superannuation in the year 2020. That is my point. This fund will relieve future governments of that substantial burden. But, in drawing up this fund, as in the next few months we will have paid off general government debt—the $96 billion that we inherited—we have looked to other liabilities the government had. We looked to the legal liability we have with respect to superannuation. As I say, that is quite a separate issue to public policy programs, whether they be for Medicare, the age pension, the disability pension or anything else. They are a function of policies determined by governments and approved by parliaments, which of course are subject to the vagaries of national politics.</para>
</talk.start>
<para>Future governments, in assessing the capacity of the Australian government to meet the consequences of an ageing population, are going to have to deal with a whole range of policy questions. We have already begun that process. We had a terribly difficult time in this very chamber convincing the Senate that, in order to ease the burden on future governments of the Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme, increases in the copayment—a copayment introduced by the opposition—were necessary. We have finally achieved that. That will help future governments sustain the Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme. But this is a separate issue where the government knows that it has this legal liability. We are establishing an investment fund with the provision that the government should use that fund to ease the burden on the budget of meeting that liability.</para>

<para>—I want to go over some of the points that I put to Senator Colbeck on behalf of the government last night, and I hope to get a response. When I raised a range of matters, Senator Colbeck suggested that the environmental planning mechanisms through the environmental plan would somehow suffice. I have checked on that and I understand that the principles of ecologically sustainable development are not incorporated in the act. That is why I have got them as a further amendment. My understanding and reading is that this act takes precedence over the EPBC Act. I asked Senator Colbeck about that last night, and I would like some clarity in the response, particularly as this amendment relates to marine parks.</para>
</talk.start>
<para>The other matter I raised last night, which I wish to go over again, is the issue that this legislation has within it the basic assumption that all areas of ocean, including what are called frontier areas of sea, each year are reported in the Department of Industry, Tourism and Resources publication and then companies are invited to get leases in those areas. If it is a frontier area, they get tax breaks. Yet there is no process for the community to look at those areas and make a decision that there ought not to be any mining, drilling, seismic testing or whatever in those areas. In other words, as I put to you last night, this bill makes the assumption that all ocean is available for allocation of leases—with even some tax breaks—unless an environmental plan of some kind prevents it.</para>
<para>This is not being done in the context of regional marine planning, and it is not being done in the context of consultation with other agencies. It is a single use assumption that oil and gas can go anywhere and that these frontier areas, new areas, are available for oil and gas companies to apply for leases in the absence of a context of regional marine planning. I would like the minister to, firstly, confirm whether this area of new acreage release is as I am suggesting it is and, secondly, give me an answer about the precedence of this act over environmental legislation.</para>

<para>—Senator Milne refers to a number of issues that were raised last night. I do have some information for both Senator Milne and Senator Brown, particularly given the unfortunate circumstances that surrounded us not having the same copies of the second reading speech, which we have fortunately now resolved. I will go over some initial points that relate to this piece of legislation and then I will deal specifically with the issues that Senator Milne has just raised. The Offshore Petroleum Bill is a rewritten and renamed version of the Petroleum (Submerged Lands) Act. The bill provides for the grant of exploration permits, retention leases, production licences, infrastructure licences, pipeline licences and special prospecting authorities and access authorities. The management regime for offshore petroleum exploration, production, processing and conveyance that is proposed by this bill is unchanged in all its essential features from what is set out in the Petroleum (Submerged Lands) Act.</para>
</talk.start>
<para>For every one of these activities authorised under the act, an environmental management plan is required as set out in the regulations made under the act—the Petroleum (Submerged Lands) (Management of Environment) Regulations 1999. We discussed those last night. The act works in concert with the Commonwealth’s overarching environmental law—the EPBC Act. These environmental regulations were developed and continue to be reviewed separately to the rewrite exercise of which we are speaking today. The key objective of the regulations is to ensure that operations are carried out in a way that is consistent with the principles of ecologically sustainable development. The amendments proposed by Senators Milne and Brown are primarily to add environmental obligations to the act that, in the government’s view, are not needed as they are handled in the regulations.</para>
<para>I will now go to the questions raised by Senator Milne. Senator Milne is correct in that, annually, potential areas for petroleum exploration are nominated by industry, state governments or Geoscience Australia and, after a process of short-listing, details of the remaining areas are circulated to Commonwealth agencies, including DEH, AFMA, AMSA and Defence, in order to ascertain information on other rights and interests. At the same time, there is a similar consultation process at the state government level, particularly in relation to environment and fishing issues. The state governments also consult with representative bodies in relation to native title interests. As a result of those consultations an area may be modified or withdrawn completely. However, it is more likely that special notices would be prepared to inform potential bidders for an area of issues they will need to address in planning or undertaking exploration activities. The special notices are included in the annual acreage release information pack. After an acreage release is announced by the Minister for Industry, Tourism and Resources, exploration companies have either six months or 12 months, depending on the area, to evaluate existing information on the area and to prepare a bid. Bidding is on a work program basis—in other words, companies bid on the basis of the amount and type of exploration work they are prepared to do in the area over the first three years of any exploration permit granted over the area.</para>
<para>After assessment of bids by the relevant Commonwealth-state-Northern Territory joint authority, the top ranked bidder is made an offer of an exploration permit over the area. The company has one month to consider the offer. If a company accepts an offer, a permit is granted and the work proposed in its original bid becomes an obligation that must be met. However, before any on-site exploration can take place, a specific operational approval is required for each activity, such as a seismic survey or a well. An approved environmental plan pursuant to the management of environment regulations is a prerequisite for obtaining an operational approval. The explorer is also under obligations to meet the requirements of the EPBC Act, particularly in relation to matters of national environmental significance. A circumstance of national environmental significance brings on obligations in relation specifically to other stakeholders.</para>
<para>Specifically in relation to the precedence issue that Senator Milne raised—what has precedence: the EPBC Act or the MOE regulations?—the answer is neither because both have different functions. The management of environment regulations look after the day-to-day management of petroleum activities. The EPBC Act is triggered if an activity has a significant impact on a matter of national environmental significance as defined in the act. The EPBC Act is triggered when an activity takes place in national heritage areas, World Heritage areas, wetlands of international importance, areas where there are threatened species or ecological communities, areas where there are listed migratory species and Commonwealth marine areas.</para>
<para>I will go to a couple of other matters that Senator Brown raised yesterday in relation to a quotation from the second reading speech, including the comment about ‘explicitly requiring consultation with relevant parties before certain adverse decisions are taken’. This was not referring to stakeholder consultation but to a step in the administrative process where the joint authority has to consult with a titleholder before making a decision to either cancel, refuse, renew or terminate a title. Consultation with a titleholder provides the best opportunity for ensuring that the JA process is a correct finding.</para>
<para>The second point was another item in the second reading speech where Senator Brown asked what is meant by the term ‘recovering petroleum on an appraisal basis’. When a discovery is made either with an exploration well, the first well drilled into a structure that is found to contain petroleum, or an appraisal well, an additional well drilled into a structure known to contain petroleum in order to determine things such as the size of the reservoir or the properties of a petroleum pool, the titleholders may wish to bring petroleum to the surface to help assess the commercial potential of the field. This recovery of petroleum will help to determine things such as composition and quality of the oil or gas and flow rates through the reservoir, thus giving an indication of possible production rates. The Offshore Petroleum Bill 2005 has merely made express what was previously implied, that a holder of an exploration permit or retention lease is able to drill a well for the purposes of appraisal.</para>
<para>Thirdly, there was a question in relation to the meaning of disapplying the Navigation Act 1912 and Occupational Health and Safety (Maritime Industry) Act 1993. The OH&amp;S (MI) Act when read together with the Navigation Act establishes an occupational health and safety regime for the maritime industry. The machinery amendment disapplying the abovementioned maritime legislation has been made to avoid the duplication of OH&amp;S regimes while the vessel is deemed to be a facility under the OPB for the purposes of schedule 3 of the bill. A facility includes some vessels that would ordinarily be covered by the maritime legislation such as a vessel used for processing, storing and offloading of petroleum, a drill shop or a pipelay barge. Once the vessel ceases to be a facility for the purposes of the OPB, the maritime legislation will apply again immediately.</para>

<para>—Senator Colbeck has just confirmed everything that I was talking about last night. He has conceded that with acreage release it is a process whereby the assumption is that the ocean is available for oil and gas exploration. Then there is a process of consultation, but the decision to issue a permit or licence is made by the designated authority alone with no reference to other sectors or agencies when that actual decision occurs.</para>
</talk.start>
<para>In relation to environmental planning, Senator Colbeck talks about the EPBC Act; however, we all know that if you release an acreage you then put out the licence. What you rely on is the company to refer it to the minister under the EPBC Act, and they are not going to do that in many cases. Even if they do, the minister has total discretion to decide whether the action that is going to be taken in that area is a controlled action or not. If on the off-chance it becomes a controlled action, there has only been one case since the introduction of the EPBC Act where the minister has actually stopped anything. That was not because he wanted to but because the courts had determined that he should and he had to—that was in the case of the bats and the Queensland fruit growers in the wet tropics.</para>
<para>Let us get realistic here about where this fits in the hierarchy of decision making. The petroleum act is pre-empting the marine planning process, and I would like to inform Senator Colbeck what the government had to say when it produced its white paper on marine planning in 2004. It said:</para>
<quote>
<para class="block">Australia’s world-leading program of regional marine planning and management will be brought directly under federal environment law to provide a clearer focus on conservation and sustainable management of the marine environment and offer greater certainty for industry.</para>
</quote>
<para class="block">I would like Senator Colbeck to explain to me how this rewrite of the petroleum bill fits in with the marine planning process that has been set down in the white paper and which the government brags is going to give a better focus on sustainable management of the marine environment and greater certainty for industry. Why are we having this as a one-user piece of legislation in the absence of this world-leading program of regional marine planning?</para>

<para>—The legislation we are debating is designed to deal with issues in relation to, as I said before, the granting of exploration permits. You missed out in your presentation just then the requirement for management plans in each of those zones that are set up. The bill is not designed to look at those things; it is designed to deal with the issues of exploration permits, retention leases, production licences et cetera and other legislation that the government has, including the EPBC Act. If there were a prospect of any exploration in a marine zone, that would be one of the triggers for the environmental processes and the EPBC Act. It is not designed to be doing the same thing. That is what we are saying and that is why we are saying that the amendments that you are proposing are not required, because they are looking at two completely different things.</para>

<para>—The minister has missed my point in explaining what is wrong with this legislation. It was designed 40 years ago, when the concept of regional marine planning was unheard of, unthought of, as was the concept of ecologically sustainable development and the concept of the precautionary principle. Forty years ago the legislation made the assumption that the sea was there to be drilled and so on and to go ahead and do it, so the only thing you had to consider in legislation was how to administer the giving of permits et cetera. In fact, the <inline font-style="italic">Bills Digest</inline> says that the bill is not intended to introduce any major changes, and that is my point. What are we doing, in 2006, just doing a re-edit of a bill which is so wildly outdated in terms of the conceptual framework in which we are working?</para>
</talk.start>
<para>The government says, ‘New concept.’ Senator Colbeck, I would really like you to take this in. Regional marine planning is something which people around the world are grappling with. When you look at an area of marine environment, you have to look at ecosystem integrity, fishing, tourism, mineral exploration, mining gas and oil, or whatever else. You have to look at how you manage a regional area of the ocean so that you have these multiple interests taken care of plus the integrity of the environment dealt with. You do not announce that you are going to have a regional planning process for marine areas and then pre-empt that by coming in with an edited rewrite of an act which is based on philosophical assumptions that are outdated and from 40 years ago. That is my problem with this. You are bringing this in and it will become law at the same time as the government is trying to introduce regional marine planning.</para>
<para>What are you going to do then? Will regional marine planning have to be adapted on the basis of what you have already agreed to in this legislation? It is a nonsense. This legislation should be deferred until after the marine planning process and the regulatory and statutory framework are introduced and passed. Then you can fit oil and gas exploration into that context—not pre-empt the process, bring this in and essentially give it precedence. I completely disagree with the minister in his answer about precedence because the act requires that a licence or permit must be used in a manner that does not interfere with:</para>
<quote>
<para class="block">... the conservation of the resources of the sea and seabed ... to a greater extent than is necessary for the reasonable exercise of the rights and performance of the duties of the first person.</para>
</quote>
<para class="block">The first person is the licence or permit holder. That gives precedence to the licence or permit over conservation. That is fundamentally written into this act.</para>
<para>You imagine on one level you are just tinkering around the edges and that is all you are doing; but you are tinkering around the edges of something which is philosophically totally flawed, totally outdated, totally last century. That is why these amendments and the next ones I will move, in relation to ecologically sustainable development, are so essential. The amendments will at least provide for marine protected areas to have this capacity to ban oil and gas exploration because, as it stands, there is nowhere in Australia’s territorial waters that the oil and gas explorers and the seismic testers cannot go. This is the issue.</para>
<para>Under the world heritage management plan it is prohibited in certain areas of the Great Barrier Reef. Where management plans exist to exclude them, then they are excluded. That is why these amendments are so important. At least it is a move to get something by way of protection. There will at least be the capacity to have marine protected areas as a place where these activities are prohibited. I would like Senator Colbeck’s answer to my questions as to where this legislation fits into the government’s regional marine planning process and white paper, to explain how it does not pre-empt that process and how it will fit with regional marine planning, because that is precisely the point that I am making.</para>

<para>—Senator Milne, you completely ignore the place of the regulations as part of this process. They were updated in consultation with the environmental movement in December 2005, just very recently. The regional marine planning process deals with the interaction of all ocean users. That is the primary purpose of that process. It is primarily to make ocean users aware of other rights, be they environmental, fishing or petroleum. There are two things that we are dealing with. You have the regulations under which the environmental conditions are dealt with as part of the act, and which were updated, as I said, in 2005, and you have the basic fundamentals of the regional marine planning process.</para>

<para>—Senator Brown, that is not what I said. I said that issues that relate to that would be dealt with under the management plan process that comes up either in the marine protected area or for the area that is designated for an exploration licence. Those are the two places where those issues could be dealt with. Each marine protected area has a management plan, as you would obviously be aware, and other environmental issues relating to a licensed area would be dealt with in the management plan that is required for each licensed area under the Environment Protection and Biodiversity Conservation Act.</para>

<para>—The minister is saying that commercial fishing, for example, is not allowed in marine protected areas, but along comes a multinational oil company and it can stick a drill in there. Before it does that, it can use explosive noise testing, which we know damages both the whole ecosystem in the immediate area and the potential for navigation, for example, of cetaceans—whales and so on. He says that looking after that will be in the regulations. Let me explain to the committee what that means. It means that once this parliament has passed this legislation—and the government has the numbers and the oil corporations know what they are doing; they have fashioned this legislation—out it goes to ensure that they will drill in any marine protected area they want to drill in.</para>
</talk.start>
<para>The legislation from an environmental point of view is shown for what it is. It is a farce. So much of the record of the Howard government over the last 10 years is echoed in this legislation. What do you do about the environment? You abrogate the responsibility of this government to look after this nation’s environmental amenity, not least the seas, which are two-thirds of the area that the federal government has aegis over when it comes to the environment. Leave it to the oil companies! In relation to decisions being made by people who are out of reach, as far as the environment movement is concerned, the oil companies will have a field day, and they have had.</para>
<para>I ask the minister whether he could inform the committee when last a major and substantial prosecution was handed down under existing legislation. Under what circumstances would he find this legislation to make any difference at all? What difference would it make? The fact is that, if you are going to have marine protected areas, then you honour those three words. Pivotal is the central word ‘protected’, but this legislation, as so often with this government, abuses Australian English and uses the word ‘protected’ without meaning protected at all. It means that marine protected areas will not be protected from the threats of oil spills, of damage during exploration and of degradation in the years ahead. When there is a commercial impulse, as Senator Milne said, that will always override the environmental one.</para>
<para>We are talking about astonishingly rich marine ecosystems off the Australian coastline which are open to exploitation. This legislation is largely about saying that an environmental regulation will not get in the way. It would have been very simple and beyond such argument as I am putting forward for the minister to come in here with legislation which said that the Environment Protection and Biodiversity Conservation Act rules, with a precautionary principle. Any threat to marine ecosystems is a matter for which the minister must insist on an environmental assessment and make a decision about that. That way there is some public ability to feed into the system. This legislation cuts the public out. The minister says, ‘When it comes to the regulations, we have ticked off with environment groups.’ Really? Is he not saying that there was consultation with environment groups which ultimately made no difference to this legislation? If it did make a difference, can he tell us what that difference is?</para>
<para>I ask the minister whether he would like to go through the exercise of writing to the several environment groups, including the Australian Conservation Foundation, the World Wildlife Fund and the Wilderness Society, and ask, ‘Would you prefer that marine protected areas are actually protected, or do you think they should be open to drilling for oil?’ We all know the answer that will come back. We know that marine protected areas should be protected, but the power of the oil industry over the Howard government, right up to the Prime Minister, is such that there is no such protection here.</para>
<para>That is what the Greens amendment that we are now dealing with simply says. If you are going to have a marine protected area, protect it. It will be protected. The vast majority of the rest of the oceans is left to the oil drillers, but not marine protected areas. The minister says that World Heritage areas are protected. If you look around, you will find that when we come to marine areas that means the Great Barrier Reef. Premier Joh Bjelke-Petersen wanted to drill into that, though he did not say it to the World Wilderness Conference in Cairns in 1980. He waited until afterwards to let that be known, but public outcry stopped it. The area consequently got World Heritage listing, and there would now be pandemonium if you wanted to drill into that area.</para>
<para>There are other areas in Australia’s marine governance which are astonishingly rich and important. In fact, the hallmark of many of these areas is that we know so little about them. We simply do not. There are new species being found all the time—not one or two but dozens—because the areas have not been adequately looked at. The minister knows that, the government knows that, the marine scientists know that, the environment groups know that and the oil companies know that. And guess who gets control of the system? It is the oil companies. In these marine protected areas, the protection applies to everybody, including Australian commercial fishermen, but not to multinational oil companies. That is what this adds up to. That is where we are going to here, because this government has such an appalling attitude to the environment. It comes right down from the Prime Minister.</para>
<para>Whatever else might be said this week about 10 years of the Howard regime, there is very little to contest the fact that it has been the most negligent prime ministership when it comes to what could have been this nation’s grand environmental heritage in that period. It is not just about the government turning its back on such things as ratifying the Kyoto protocol, protecting species, ending old growth logging in this country and using its powers to prevent broadscale clearance of native vegetation, which harbours so many rare and endangered species. Offshore, when it comes to whaling, there has been a lot from this government through the years. But when this summer it got down to the test of doing something about the Japanese whaling and, at least, sending a ship to surveil them and tell the rest of the world what they were doing, this government sat on its hands. It had more important trade considerations to take up. And that is what is happening here. This is the Howard mantra: never let the environment get in the way of a dollar, particularly when it comes from a multinational corporation.</para>
<para>This legislation is about failing to protect this nation’s marine heritage—even the limited areas that are called ‘marine protected areas’, because the oil drillers will not be stopped from infringing on those areas and drilling for oil. That will be after a process, which can be quite damaging, of assessing the area through exploratory activities. When the minister says, ‘It will be handled in the regulations; that is the protection for these areas,’ that is not acceptable in a parliament which is worth its salt. You do not allow any government—particularly the Howard government, with its environmental record—to say: ‘Trust us. We will write regulations in the future. They are not available to you. We will not bring them out. I cannot tell you what they are, but they will look after marine protected areas.’</para>
<para>You do not need regulations to look after marine protected areas—you support this Greens proposal that they be protected and that is it. You have no open door for oil exploration and oil drilling, with all the dangers that come with that down the line. You protect the area. Otherwise, call these areas ‘marine areas vulnerable to oil drilling’ and just be honest about it. That is all you have to do. But this is greenwash. It is dishonest towards the Australian public. Calling these areas ‘marine protected areas’ when they are not is deceiving, and deliberately deceiving, the Australian voter, as happens so often with the environment—and not just the environment—under this government.</para>

<para>—Following on from Senator Brown in relation to the regulations which the minister is touting, it is even more imperative that we pass these amendments because there is no ecosystem based management provided for in the legislation. The areas governed by the legislation are separated along state and territory boundaries. There are no provisions establishing regular reviews of management decisions and risk assessments to reflect new knowledge and understanding. In the regulations which Senator Colbeck talked about, there is a requirement for an environment plan to be submitted whenever a new or modified petroleum activity is proposed by an operator, but the decision whether to issue a permit, lease or licence does not involve collaborative decision making or involvement of those with expertise in ecology. There is also no obligation on the designated authority when assessing environmental plans to consider ecologically sustainable development.</para>
</talk.start>
<para>The decision to issue a permit or licence made by the designated authority is made alone, with no reference to other sectors or agencies, and the requirement that operators act in a manner that does not interfere with the conservation of marine resources is qualified by the statement, ‘to a greater extent than is necessary,’ clearly making the environment secondary to the needs of the operator. The references to conservation in the regulations and the legislation refer only to the resources of the sea and the seabed and not to the marine environment as a whole. The regulations, while incorporating more than the legislation does, certainly do not go to the issues I was talking about earlier—namely, the requirement for regional marine planning; the requirement that the designated authority, when assessing environment plans and whether or not to issue a permit, can do so alone; and the clear statement of intent that operators act in a manner that does not interfere with the conservation of marine resources to a greater extent than is necessary.</para>
<para>That is the ‘out’ clause for the industry at every turn. They say, ‘It is necessary for us to interfere with the conservation of marine resources,’ and, therefore, they are allowed to do it. That is the problem. That is why we want a situation in which we can exclude and prohibit oil exploration in marine protected areas. It is tragic that we have a situation where the reference to conservation refers only to the resources of the sea and the seabed and not to the marine environment as a whole. That reflects the thinking of four years ago when people talked not about the marine environment, but just about the resources of the sea and the seabed as if they were simply resources to be taken in the absence of any reference to the national oceans policy and in the absence of any regional marine planning.</para>
<para>That is why I am moving these particular amendments which I think most Australians would welcome, and certainly those in the fishing industry would welcome because they are constantly frustrated by what they see as an attempt to get the fishing communities out of marine protected areas in order to let the oil and gas explorers in so that they can do whatever they like in relation to their seismic testing and so on, and not have to fight with the fishermen in terms of resource allocation, space and so on. So let us make it a little bit consistent here: let us have marine protected areas in which oil exploration is prohibited.</para>

<para class="block">Interestingly, we have a 600-page act which has no object. It is unbelievable! I thought I would assist the Senate by providing an object for this act. I move that the object of this act be to ensure that any offshore activities relating to petroleum exploration, recovery, storage and transport are carried out in a way that is consistent with the principles of ecologically sustainable development, especially in relation to the conservation of marine resources. I cannot see that there could be any objection to that, because I then go on to define what the principles of ecologically sustainable development are. Furthermore—and I will get to this in a minute—I move for the incorporation of the precautionary principle.</para>
<para>The reason I argue that it is essential that we put in an object and a definition of ecologically sustainable development is that the subordinate regulations do provide specifically for ecologically sustainable development but this is not provided for in the act, and it ought to be. The reason that it ought to be in the act is that, at the moment, whereas the regulations state that the object is to ensure that any petroleum activity in an adjacent area is carried out in a way that is consistent with the principles of ecologically sustainable development, there is absolutely no obligation on the designated authority when assessing environmental plans to consider ecologically sustainable development. There is no point in having it in the regulations if there is no obligation on the designated authority when you are assessing the environment plans to consider ecologically sustainable development, so let us put it in the act as well as in the regulations. I think that it is imperative that we move to do that.</para>
<para>Secondly, with regard to the precautionary principle, I would like some clarification from Senator Colbeck. I said yesterday that, when a permit or licence is given, a company can potentially hold it for 26 years. That is as I see it, and I would like some clarification as to whether that is the case. I will explain the logic for that. If an exploration permit lasts six years and a renewal of an exploration permit lasts for another five years, with the option for a retention lease for another 15 years if the area is not economically viable in current circumstances, it does seem possible for a company to have a commercial interest in an area for up to 26 years before production occurs.</para>

</motion>
<para class="block">There is always one point in the year that is a watershed for people interested in Indigenous issues in this country. That is, of course, the annual tabling of the report from the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Social Justice Commissioner. That report was tabled a number of weeks ago and is now formally being presented to the Senate. Those people who have an interest in Indigenous affairs, including people in the Public Service, politicians and academics, really value the work that is put into this document by Tom Calma, the Social Justice Commissioner, and his team at the Human Rights and Equal Opportunity Commission. I think the document this year is one of the most outstanding contributions that Tom Calma and HREOC have made to the issues confronting Indigenous Australians at this time. It is extremely comprehensive and extremely well researched and presented.</para>
<para>This year it goes to two main issues facing Indigenous Australians. It goes to their health status and it makes substantial comment about the new arrangements Indigenous Australians have faced since the demise of ATSIC and the introduction of the new whole-of-government idea of shared responsibility agreements. The commissioner makes a number of interesting but very profound statements. In talking about the health of Indigenous nations, he says:</para>
<quote>
<para class="block">... we must remember that we are a wealthy nation. It is not credible to suggest that one of the wealthiest nations in the world cannot solve a health crisis affecting less than 3% of its citizens. Research suggests that addressing Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander health inequality will involve no more than a 1% per annum increase in total health expenditure in Australia over the next ten years. If this funding is committed, then the expenditure required is then likely to decline thereafter.</para>
</quote>
<para class="block">How salient a point is that? We are one of the wealthiest nations in this world and yet the health of our Indigenous people is significantly poor, and the outcomes have not improved in decades. The Social Justice Commissioner outlines a 25-year plan to address the health of our Indigenous Australians. I sincerely hope that this government looks at this report and puts some long and hard thought into the credibility of adopting such a plan.</para>
<para>The commissioner raises a number of issues in relation to the three main failings in the approach of Australian governments to date. He does label state and territory governments in this, but of course we know that additional money is spent by the federal government in Indigenous health. I think is fair to say that there ought to be a 20- to 30-year vision for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Australia. The framework in this report sets that out, and it at least provides some sort of answer and some kind of guidance as to ways in which we might tackle this problem in this country.</para>
<para>In the second part of the report he makes substantial comment about the new introduction of shared responsibility agreements. He highlights the problems with the coordination, effectiveness of service delivery and the introduction of SRAs. I think his comments are extremely accurate. There are no suitable benchmarks in the introduction of SRAs, no rigorous time lines are put in place to meet improved health standards, there is a substantial lack of investment in a coordinated national strategy and there is certainly a lack of practical and adequately financed programs. This report is well worth a read. It makes a number of very critical comments about the inadequacies of shared responsibility agreements and outlines some major concerns about how they are not addressing the human rights needs and the emotional and social needs of Indigenous Australians. I seek leave to continue my remarks later.</para>

<para>—This morning I returned from Iraq with the Deputy Prime Minister, Mark Vaile. We met with senior members of the Iraqi government on behalf of Australian wheat growers. We wanted to assure the administration that our growers are still very keen to supply their important market. The accusations that have been levelled at the Australian government by the opposition today are tragically ill-informed, and the claims that have been made about jeopardising Australia’s wheat exports to Iraq are ill-founded, to say the least, and unhelpful to our prospects of re-establishing this very important market.</para>
</talk.start>
<para>The Australian government would never undermine Australian wheat farmers. We will continue to work very closely with the Iraqi government to ensure that our farmers do regain access to this important market and, in fact, to all world markets. Iraq has been a strong trading partner for Australian wheat farmers for 58 years, with exports to the Middle East nation growing to over 14 per cent of total wheat exports in 1989-90. This strong trade has continued over the past 15 years with up to 15.6 per cent of total Australian wheat exports being sent to Iraq each year. In fact, the Australian wheat trade with Iraq has a very proud history, with Iraq qualifying as one of Australia’s top five wheat export markets for the first time in 1970, during which 472,000 tonnes of wheat was exported, which represented about five per cent of total Australian wheat exports for that year.</para>
<para>Our world wheat trade, including to Iraq, is absolutely crucial to Australian farmers and growers, especially those from my home state of South Australia. While South Australia is the third-largest wheat producing state behind Western Australia and New South Wales, it is the second-largest wheat exporter after Western Australia. For the three years to 2004-05, wheat accounted for five per cent of South Australia’s merchandise exports, although this figure was significantly affected by the low level of exports in 2004-05. In both 2003 and 2004, wheat actually represented nine per cent of South Australia’s exports. In 2005, Australia’s wheat exports to Iraq were second only to wheat exports to Indonesia: 8.9 per cent of all Australia’s wheat exports went to Iraq.</para>
<para>It is not just wheat exports that the Australian government will look at for the future when we are talking to senior representatives of this country. For example, Iraq is a country which uses a lot of irrigation from both the Tigris and the Euphrates rivers. It was interesting to see that they are having salinity and drainage problems not dissimilar to ours. There will be great opportunities in the future for us to assist that country with agricultural technology. In fact, Deputy Prime Minister Chalabi sought to assure us that, when the time is right and that technology is required, Australia will be among those with a favoured nation status. Australia’s expertise in drainage and irrigation, along with a range of other agricultural technologies, will be very important to this country as it seeks to regain its place in the world as one of the wealthier countries of the Middle East.</para>
<para>As I noted earlier today, both Deputy Prime Minister Chalabi and Trade Minister Mawlud told Mr Vaile and me that it was well understood in Iraq that Australia’s wheat was of a very high quality and was much sought after by the community for their baking purposes. Australian wheat growers should be pleased and reassured that their grain comes with such a high recommendation. Also, Australia’s military and humanitarian assistance provided to the Iraqi people will, Mr Chalabi assured us, be recognised in future trade opportunities and, as I said, in the technology transfers that will become available. In fact, Australian growers can be optimistic that they will be included in future contracts, with Deputy Prime Minister Chalabi saying that Australia’s loyalty to Iraq will be remembered and recognised.</para>
<para>Our first meeting on Sunday in Iraq was with the Prime Minister, Mr Jaafari, a man who has now been part of three Iraqi administrations. Mr Jaafari expressed his appreciation that the Australian government had taken the time to travel to meet face to face with such senior members of the government. To travel for four days to spend one day in Baghdad is a significant exercise and one involving a great deal of security, something which was well understood by the Prime Minister and his deputy, Mr Chalabi. Mr Jaafari spoke very warmly of the relationship between our two countries and, in particular, with our Prime Minister, Mr Howard, whom he has met twice: once in Baghdad during Mr Howard’s visit and once in New York. He declared Australia to be a very good friend of Iraq.</para>
<para>Mr Chalabi, prior to his time as a senior minister, was a resistance leader and in an earlier life was, in fact, a maths professor at an American university in Beirut. He is a very personable character. He has a keen interest in international affairs and is very well briefed on Australia. In fact, he was particularly well briefed on the details of the Cole inquiry. It was surprising to travel so far to meet with somebody who knew so much about the detail and the evidence that has come before the inquiry. I have to say that he was very firm on behalf of the Iraqi government in making it extremely clear that in the short term the government had no plans to deal with the Australian Wheat Board. He did, however, differentiate, thankfully, the quality of the product, the consistency of supply and the loyalty to Iraq from the supplier, AWB. I am very optimistic, and growers in Australia, particularly in my state of South Australia, can be reassured, that those criteria—the loyalty, the quality and the consistency over 58 years—will be taken into account when future contracts are determined.</para>
<para>I wanted also to thank very much the members of the Kansas National Guard who managed Saddam Hussein’s former palace, which had been turned into accommodation quarters for us to stay in. I must say it was the first time I had stayed in such a sumptuous hotel room, with gold furniture. It was more like the Palace of Versailles than a hotel in the Middle East. It was also the first time I slept in a room where the windows were totally sandbagged—quite a chilling experience.</para>
<para>I would also like to thank the members of the Australian and United States defence forces who provided transport, security and advice to the delegation. These people, particularly our own people in Iraq, have such dedication. We met with a group of them: enthusiastic, fit young Australian men and women who are doing their bit for their country, so far away from home. I met with a woman from Newcastle who, after six months, was looking forward to going home yesterday. She told me that life in Iraq is tough, particularly when it is 50 degrees, but never once did she flinch from the opportunity. She loved the experience and she valued her opportunity to serve her country. There were so many of those people; it made you feel really proud to be an Australian.</para>
<para>Finally, can I thank the Prime Minister for giving me the opportunity to take part in this delegation to represent Australian wheat growers and work towards gaining new contracts for their product. I would just like to assure them that Australia is on the map in Iraq and I am very optimistic that before long our trade will be resumed in this very important market.</para>

</talker>
<para>—Last Sunday evening when I came back to Canberra, I was lucky enough to attend a live broadcast by the ABC local radio network at our National Museum in Canberra. The performance was by a group known as the Coodabeen Champions. This group of men has been performing on our local radio network for almost 25 years now, and I am publicly announcing myself as a fan of theirs. It was a wonderful experience, after listening to them across Australia over the last few years—too few years!—to actually see them perform live and to get to meet a couple of them. At the end of their performance, I gave them a bit of a commitment that I would manage to make some kind of speech in the Senate about them.</para>
</talk.start>
<para>I went to their website to find out more, even though I feel that in many ways this group of guys are my friends: I have been listening to them for so long, I have heard so much about their families, I have argued with them on the radio, I have found myself responding to their humour. So I turned to their website, using the wonderful ABC website, to find out a little bit about their history because, whilst I felt I knew what they did, I thought it would be good to find out where they came from. Their website told me that their Coodabeen magic began on Anzac Day 1981, when Jeff Richardson, who is still a member of the Coodabeen Champions, and his mate Simon Whelan, who was a member—and I do miss Simon’s dulcet tones—were walking across to the MCG, probably to a match of some kind, and were talking about the kind of football commentary that was on the radio. Being very knowledgeable blokes, they felt that they could do commentary that was better, more focused and more ‘real’ for the community. Out of this discussion came a group that has now entertained many Australians. The core of their humour is that you feel like you are sitting around having a chat.</para>
<para>As I have mentioned before in this place, I come from a country family where my dad had no sons so I have inherited his overwhelming passion for football and cricket. I have personally shared this particular passion with the Coodabeens on the radio for many years. Because of the way the ABC operates in our country, this particular passion has been able to be shared, Senator Santoro, across all of Queensland. I well remember working in Brisbane in the Public Service, listening to 612 4QR on a Sunday evening and laughing quite loudly about different songs that were made up, such as <inline font-style="italic">Ooh Aah Glen McGrath</inline>, celebrating the speed bowling abilities of our national pace bowler. There were many comments also about other legendary cricketers of Australia. Who can forget their comments about David Boon—their respect for his leadership and his fine figure, as well as his batting ability? At exactly the same time, friends of mine in Townsville were listening to the same program and were able to interact there and then call me up and laugh about what was going on.</para>
<para>When I transferred to North Queensland with the Public Service, I used to do a lot of driving on Sunday evenings, going between regional centres. Once again I was able to listen to the Coodabeens on 630AM Townsville. As I was driving north to Cairns, I was able to pick up the broadcast on 95.5FM. As I was saying to the guys from the Coodabeen Champions the other night, one of my clearest memories is driving from Rockhampton to Townsville one Sunday evening, in the dark, and laughing out loud in the vehicle over stories that the guys were telling about their various experiences at debutante—and they pronounced it ‘debutante’—balls in the regional countryside in Victoria. The immediacy of the shared experience, their ability to hit on something that we can mutually enjoy, is I think one of the very important parts of their humour.</para>
<para>At the moment, the Coodabeen Champions—they have returned to the ABC on Sunday evenings—are Jeff Richardson; Ian Cover, who spent a period in what he described as ‘the blue team’ in the Victorian parliament; Billy Baxter, one of the relatively new members; and Greg Champion. These guys have their own friendship and their own way of interacting, but I think the reason they can list so many Australians across the country as more than just fans—because ‘fans’ intimates a passive relationship—is that the experience that they provide is much more interactive and people feel as though they know them. People actually contact them, and a regular component of the Sunday evening program is the emails going backwards and forwards. There are various spot quizzes where people talk about musical interludes, not just the ones that people are really fond of but also, much more often—and I think it is something about the Australian sense of humour—people write in or email or whatever to talk about their least favourite, most horrible music experiences. Somehow we all have those moments, and once again that particular kind of interaction occurs.</para>
<para>When I was in Rockhampton, once again in my period working in the Public Service, I listened to 837 Rockhampton, which is one of my favourite ABC stations. Those people who have been lucky enough to go to that beautiful part of Queensland will know that the ABC station in Rockhampton is a heritage building and it has been fully restored as the ABC studio in Central Queensland. A good friend of mine, Ross Quinn, was the long-term manager of that station. He retired only last year, after a very long career with the ABC. When I have visited Rockhampton at different times as a public servant, then with my work with the CPSU—the union that looks after the Public Service—and subsequently in this job, it has always been a pleasure for me to go in and visit the ABC staffers at Rockhampton. Sometimes we would have a talk on air, sometimes not. But very often we would exchange experiences, talking about different programs on the ABC that we had enjoyed and sometimes about programs that we had not enjoyed as much. But, pretty regularly, we would talk about an episode or an experience that had happened on the Coodabeens the previous week or even several years earlier that we had both enjoyed.</para>
<para>I am using the experience of the Coodabeen Champions as an example of the wonderful value of the ABC local radio network across our country. It provides such an amazing linkage for so many of us and a shared experience that we can discuss. We have an ability to link that I think has been provided by the amazing services of the ABC. Now, across Australia, there are over 352 locally managed stations. I know I sound a little bit like an advertisement—which of course we cannot use in terms of the ABC. But, in terms of our lives, growing up in various parts of Australia, everybody sitting in this chamber must have some ABC memories.</para>
<para>When we were discussing the future of radio in our country—and this comes up—we were also talking about the way the medium has changed. Now, not only are people able to listen to the radio in the car or at home but there is the interactive ability of the internet. There is something that I do not use but that my nieces and nephews talk about all the time: podcasting. I know the Coodabeens use this process, but for me it always sounds much more like an insect than something you could actually use! However, I know it is popular and I know it is something people are continuing to use now.</para>
<para>I believe that the role of our radio network is something of which we can all be proud. I genuinely enjoyed my experience on Sunday night when I was able to see the people I had shared so many hours with over almost 20 years of listening—not all the time; it was not something you had to do every Sunday night, but somehow you picked up the conversations. You might not listen for several weeks but then you would be somewhere and hear their voices and you would flow right into the experience.</para>
<para>I hope that people across our country will continue to value this kind of experience. I am a fan, as you would have picked up from this—although not as much as one of the women who was attending that live broadcast on Sunday night. She had tattooed the theme of the Coodabeen Champions on her arm. The theme of their show is: ‘You’re only young once, but anyone can be immature.’ That lady was describing to all of us—those of us in the studio and also those many listeners across the country—how important this particular motto was to her, how it gave her strength and also how proud her decision to have that tattoo made her family. I am a fan, I will continue to be so and I hope everybody else listens in from time to time.</para>

<para>—Happy birthday, Senator Moore! As I rise here tonight, grain growers across the country are working on their cropping strategy for the coming year. They are working out how rising fertiliser prices—up $100 a tonne on the last year—and fuel price hikes from around 90c to $1.40 a litre will impact on their business. They are praying for favourable rains after years and years of drought. They are getting prepared for the coming season. They are some of the people that I represent.</para>

<para>Today marks the 30th day of hearings for the Cole inquiry. Since the Cole inquiry started its public hearings on 16 January this year, barely a day has passed when the media and political spotlight has not has been on the AWB, the single desk and the Howard-Vaile government. I have to say I am bitterly disappointed at some of the hysteria, political point scoring and misinformation that has been whipped up by some. Australian wheat farmers are already suffering from the impact of drought and low prices. This sort of ongoing commentary does nothing to help them, and the attitude of the ALP does nothing to help them.</para>

<para>—Perhaps if Senator Conroy remained silent for a moment he might learn something, particularly when he is seeing most of rural Australia from his Melbourne office. We all need to take a long, deep breath and await the findings of the Cole inquiry. This inquiry has been given all the powers it needs to get to the bottom of the issue.</para>
</talk.start>
</continue>
<para>I want to stress a very important point: the single desk is not on trial. It makes me very cranky to see some people deliberately attempting to link the Cole inquiry and Australia’s wheat single-desk export marketing system. The Cole inquiry and the principle of the single desk are two entirely separate issues. The single desk is not an Australian company; it is the vehicle for this nation’s wheat export arrangements, arrangements that have been in place for decades and that have brought great benefits to our Australian farmers. I find it quite unbelievable that there are those who seek to attack the Deputy Prime Minister and Leader of The Nationals, Mark Vaile. Yesterday, the Leader of the Opposition, Kim Beazley, claimed that Mark Vaile headed off to Iraq to avoid accountability in the parliament.</para>

<para>—Sorry—Mr Beazley and most his frontbench would have between them. I say to those people who seek to attack Mr Vaile: play the ball and not the man. As long as this nation’s growers operate in a distorted global wheat market and the majority of Australian wheat growers want the single desk arrangements to remain, The Nationals will fight to retain the single desk.</para>
</talk.start>
</continue>
<para>Australian grain growers are competing against distorted world markets right across the world. Our wheat growers are not playing on a level playing field. We need to remember that US and EU farmers alone receive around a billion dollars in farm subsidies every day. The single desk allows our grain growers to compete with international providers. I am advised that Econtech, who are respected economic modellers, have calculated that the average premium achieved as a result of having a single wheat desk is $13 a tonne.</para>
<para>Australia’s wheat industry employs more than 150,000 people in rural Australia, and the single desk arrangements deliver almost 2,000 jobs in rural Australia alone. Approximately 45,000 non-farm business enterprises in rural Australia rely on the profitability of the wheat industry. Every day, wheat growers tell me and colleagues in The Nationals to save the single desk. Last week, more than 700 wheat growers rallied at Warracknabeal to send a clear message: save the single desk. Two quotes from the media reporting on that meeting stuck out for me. Firstly, ‘Every time Beazley opens his damn mouth, we lose another couple of hundred thousand dollars’ and, secondly, ‘Bracks should tell Rudd to pull his head in and stop doing the American grain growers’ dirty work.’ Those are not my words but the words of angry, distressed farmers who are just trying to make a living. Their message to Labor is clear: hands off the single desk.</para>
<para>Last Thursday, the <inline font-style="italic">Land</inline> newspaper, the paper that New South Wales farmers turn to every Thursday for the latest ag industry news, published the findings of a Rural Press nationwide survey of wheat growers. The results were overwhelmingly in favour of the single desk. Seventy-three per cent of Australian grain growers still support the single desk for wheat exports; almost 70 per cent of them think that AWB has been unduly victimised compared with other international companies named in the oil for food scandal; and 69 per cent of growers support AWB maintaining its role as the wheat export single desk manager. This is a survey that was taken within the last couple of weeks and accurately reflects the feelings of those growers. As I travel across New South Wales, the message is still the same: those growers want the single desk to stay.</para>
<para>This Friday, around 1,000 wheat growers are expected to gather at the Parkes racecourse to send the same message: they want the single desk to stay. But I ask where Labor are on the single desk. I suppose it depends on who you ask. Had we asked Labor’s current shadow minister for trade, Mr Rudd, last week, his answer was:</para>
<quote>
<para class="block">We need to consider it on its business and economic merits. This requires thorough consultation with the wheat industry. My colleague Gavin O’Connor is currently engaged in those consultations and we won’t be making any premature policy announcement on that until those consultations are concluded.</para>
</quote>
<para class="block">Labor’s shadow minister for revenue, small business and competition, Mr Fitzgibbon, recently described the single desk as ‘an anachronistic wheat marketing monopoly which has been selling Australian farmers short.’ Then last week, after what must have been a very thorough consultation with some 30 growers in Wagga Wagga, Mr Rudd declared that Labor would support the single desk.</para>
<para>Labor claim that they act in the interests of wheat growers, and they certainly seem to feign sympathy for wheat growers. But, given those two quotes, I wonder where they are on all of this. There certainly does not seem to be any kind of position. If attacking the single desk is Labor’s idea of support for the single desk, then I think that is very sad for Australian farmers.</para>

The majority of those growers are saying to us that they want the single desk marketing arrangements for wheat to stay. While ever the majority of those farmers are saying that to us, while ever our wheat farmers are competing against distorted world markets, then The Nationals will continue to fight to make sure that we keep that single desk.</para>

</talker>
<para>—I rise tonight to talk about the generosity of spirit and community mindedness that characterises this country. I am talking about volunteering: a vital thread of the fabric that makes up our society. It is the backbone of community initiatives and sporting, arts and community organisations and it is a great vehicle for social involvement and engagement in Australia. Each year more than 4.4 million Australians donate their time on a voluntary basis to their communities. In 2005 alone, Australian volunteers provided 830 million hours of service in areas as diverse as arts, cultural, educational, environmental, health support, emergency service, sporting and humanitarian or animal welfare organisations. Beyond this, estimates suggest that volunteering contributes around $42 billion a year to the Australian economy.</para>
</talk.start>
<para>In my home state, statistics show that 34 per cent of adult Tasmanians contribute, on average, two hours a week as volunteers. That translates into well over 100,000 Tasmanian volunteers and around 11 million hours of voluntary work in Tasmania each year. One great example of this effort is the valuable work done by volunteers involved with the Hobart Cat Centre. The Hobart Cat Centre was established in 1974 by Florence Robson, who herself was a great volunteer. She began the centre off her own bat with no government support. She did it simply because she cared about the fate of Hobart’s unwanted cats and kittens. On her death Florence Robson even bequeathed her home to the centre so that the volunteers could continue her work. Today the centre has grown to capacity and will soon relocate from Robson’s old home to a new state-of-the-art facility, which will be built largely through volunteer efforts. The land for the facility has been negotiated by the hardworking president and committee of the Cat Centre board, both of which volunteer valuable time to lobby and organise on behalf of the centre.</para>
<para>The centre also runs extensive education programs in the community which are designed to promote responsible cat ownership, including desexing and microchipping. These programs are largely delivered on a voluntary basis. On top of these activities, the centre has established two successful second-hand shops in the greater Hobart community. Each of the shops provide vital funds for the ongoing work of the centre and each of the shops—one in Glenorchy and one in Blackmans Bay—is staffed by volunteers.</para>
<para>Volunteers are central to the work of the Hobart Cat Centre. Without them it could not undertake its work. Because of volunteers, the centre has dealt with more than 100,000 cats over the years, finding a home for as many as it could. The Cat Centre’s typical volunteers range from young students who volunteer their time to help clean out cages, feed cats or even just to provide attention and human contact for the animals to hardworking executives who oversee the day-to-day running of the centre in their spare time. That is the beauty of volunteering. It provides an outlet outside of work or study that allows you to use your skills to benefit others. What is even better is that this can be done in an environment where the aim is the benefit of others, not just commercial gain, and anyone can help out.</para>
<para>Volunteering can also make major events happen. There is no better example of this than the Melbourne 2006 Commonwealth Games, which begin in a few short weeks. This massive event will feature 4,500 athletes, around a million spectators and close to a billion television viewers worldwide. While there have been some recent media reports concerning volunteer attrition at the games, it is expected that around 15,000 volunteers will support the 12-day festival of sport that is Melbourne 2006. And it is not easy work either. A normal volunteer day is expected to be at least eight to 10 hours, and each volunteer has committed to provide up to 100 hours of service. The simple fact is that, without the efforts of these volunteers in marshalling, transport, media liaison, first aid and other areas, the games would not be possible. In total, the Commonwealth Games are offering 400 different types of volunteer options at more than 80 venues across Victoria. And the volunteers filling these places are not just Victorians; they come from right around the country, including Tasmania. It is a great display of a national spirit of service.</para>
<para>I think all senators in this place would support me in saying that we should all do our bit to continue the growth and development of a volunteering culture in this country. Volunteering provides a means to ensure the survival of many organisations and services that could not survive in the world of commerce and the market alone. It enriches the lives of those involved and provides new skills and training opportunities to volunteers. It is also a great social outlet. The 2006 National Volunteer Week runs from 15 to 21 May. The theme this year is ‘Change your world. Start now.’ It is a great theme for driving recruitment to voluntary organisations and causes around Australia, and we should all do what we can to support it.</para>
<para>As I outlined in an adjournment speech a few weeks ago, I believe that as politicians we need to find time and energy not just to focus on the day-to-day adversarial cut and thrust of parliamentary debate but also to coordinate, through the people and places we represent, greater community involvement and stronger social engagement and cohesion in this country. To me there are some issues that are above politics, and volunteering is one of them. We can and should work together and use our time, resources and influence to support activities like volunteering. Having said that, there are also things we can do as a parliament to support volunteering. Despite the massive success of and support for volunteering in Australia, there are some dark clouds on the horizon. Increasing red tape is one of them. As Jan McCallum wrote in a piece entitled ‘How over-regulation is killing off volunteerism’ in the <inline font-style="italic">Age</inline> last year:</para>
<quote>
<para class="block">It is time governments considered how the weight of regulation is strangling community work.</para>
</quote>
<para class="block">While I think we would all agree that subeditor’s licence has made for a pretty good headline, and while I do not believe the statistics suggest that volunteering is in decline or being killed off, I do believe that the environment in which voluntary and community organisations operate has become more complex and government requirements have become more demanding in recent years. I also believe that there is little doubt that this trend is having an effect in some quarters and, indeed, is discouraging participation in voluntary activities in some sectors. As McCallum rightly points out, in the last few years voluntary groups in Australia have had to absorb GST compliance, new privacy laws and increased public liability costs and procedures. Each, she argues, is not enough in its own right to discourage participation, but when taken together can discourage people from undertaking voluntary or community work. This effect can also discourage organisations from undertaking certain activities. She goes on to argue:</para>
<quote>
<para class="block">Many organisations now think twice about whether activities require too much effort for the benefit obtained.</para>
</quote>
<para class="block">There is obviously a delicate balance here for parliament, but we should be looking to reduce the red tape barrier that faces the voluntary and community sector where possible. It is in our interest to do it. Volunteering and community service adds, as I said earlier, $42 billion to our economy each year.</para>
<para>In July 2003, the Productivity Commission completed a study, <inline font-style="italic">Social capital: reviewing the concept and its policy implications</inline>, which found there is scope for governments to take more account of social capital in policy development and be wary of the ability that policy and regulation have to erode social capital. In particular, it suggested, public liability laws and bureaucratic controls on community groups and events have this ability. As the commission chairman, Gary Banks, observed at the time, ‘The available evidence tells us that, while some government actions can undermine social capital, it is much harder for governments to create or rebuild it.’</para>
<para>There is no doubt that we are becoming more aware of the importance that volunteering and social capital have in keeping Australia running smoothly. But there is still more to be done and more to be learned. In many respects the efforts made through volunteering are not easily measured by the dollar based accounting systems that we typically use to assess the value of institutions or activities in Australia. That is why there are so many unsung heroes working away tirelessly in communities in every state and territory doing their bit without recognition.</para>
<para>I am pleased that we at least acknowledge this now and are beginning to take steps to address it. One step in particular that I am pleased about is the inclusion of specific questioning in this year’s census about volunteering. Using the census in this way will give us the first comprehensive snapshot of the state of volunteering in Australia and help us correlate the benefit it has for our nation more precisely. By using the census in this way, we can better understand the generosity, kindness and community spirit of the millions of Australian volunteers. And through better understanding this, we can better protect, encourage— <inline font-style="italic">(Time expired)</inline>

<para>—Monday, 6 March this year is a public holiday in Western Australia in celebration of Labour Day. While Labour Day is something that a lot of members here understand a lot about, it gives people like me great pause for reflection on the contribution that the wider labour movement has made and the many struggles and victories that have gone before as we anticipate the struggles and victories ahead in the brave new world.</para>
</talk.start>
<para>In doing that I was having a conversation with Kim Young, a person I know very well in Perth, a former assistant secretary to the CFMEU and a former ALP candidate for the federal seat of Moore. In talking about that we reflected on the fact that a lot of young people do not understand and do not have the knowledge of a lot of the terms that are in common parlance these days. One that came to mind when we were having a discussion was the term ‘to go cap in hand’. He told me a story of an experience he had with his father, an experience that I will relay to the chamber now. He said:</para>
<quote>
<para class="block">When I was growing up around Fremantle in the fifties my father worked at a timber mill in Hamilton hill owned by Hawker Sidleys who later became Bunning’s. In those days most workers wore a soft cap to work.</para>
<para class="block">One of my most vivid memories of those years was as a nine year old going with Mum and my brothers on a Friday afternoon to the sawmill where the old man worked to wait outside while he fronted the boss about a raise.</para>
<para class="block">There we were looking through the front window watching him stand cap in hand almost begging for a pay rise.</para>
<para class="block">Mum explained to us that this was the standard procedure if you wanted an increase in those days as there was no union to bargain on his behalf.</para>
<para class="block">Mum also explained that should he get the raise then it was off to the beer garden of the Newmarket pub, down the road for fish and chips and a soft drink for the Kids and a beer or two for the old man and her.</para>
<para class="block">When the old man came out of the office I couldn’t help but notice that he was crying and I said to Mum that it looked like he didn’t get the raise but we soon found that I was wrong and off to the pub we went.</para>
<para class="block">Later that night I learned from mum that the tears that the old man had on his face where caused by the humiliation he felt at having to stand in front of all of the office staff and beg cap in hand for an increase in his pay—</para>
</quote>
<para class="block">to support his family. This is the Australia that Prime Minister Howard wants to recreate. Mr Young says he is firmly convinced that over the next few years many Australian workers are going to feel that same humiliation that his old man did because there is no way that an individual worker is going to be able to bargain with their employer and expect to win the sorts of wages and conditions that are currently enjoyed by workers of today. Those workers who think that their boss is a good bloke, so they will be all right, will remember the words of people like Mr Young when the boss comes to them and says that he has to cut their wages—as we are already seeing in some places—he has to slash their conditions or he has to let them go so that he can compete in the market that Mr Howard has supposedly created.</para>
<para>Our current employment conditions were not just handed to people by bosses out of the goodness of their hearts as some might think. They were won by the struggles of many generations of working men and women who were prepared to have a go and stand up and fight for decent wages and conditions. That is why it is important that we commemorate and celebrate days like Labour Day. Mr Young goes on to say that he is proud to have been a part of some of those struggles over his years as a union official and that he hopes that he never has to stand, cap in hand, in front of a boss like his old man did.</para>

</talker>
<para>—I rise tonight to pay tribute to a great South Australian and champion of the people, a friend and political colleague, the Hon. Terance Gerald Roberts, Minister for Aboriginal Affairs and Reconciliation and Minister for Correctional Services, who passed away on 18 February, 2006. Born into an Irish Catholic working-class family in 1946 to parents Tob and Tet Roberts, Terry grew up with his brother John in Millicent in the state’s south-east.</para>
</talk.start>
<para>It was here that Terry joined the Australian Labor Party, secured his trade qualifications before working as a merchant mariner and was elected shop steward for the AMWU. Millicent was also where he met and married in 1972 Elizabeth Braham, and together they raised two sons, Nick and Tim. In November 1985 he was elected as a member of the Legislative Council of South Australia. Terry had a deep commitment to working people. He knew not only where he was from, but whose side he was on—the side of workers, the side of Indigenous Australians, the side of those who needed someone to speak up for them. A man of principle, Terry was always prepared to give to all, even those with opposing views, a fair go, a fair hearing. But his overriding principle was to ensure any decisions were made in the best interests of those he represented as a union delegate and, for two decades, as a member of the South Australian parliament.</para>
<para>His state funeral last Friday in Adelaide was attended by more than 600 people from all walks of life and political persuasions. Particularly notable were the many people from Aboriginal communities who came to pay their respects to the man they claimed had been their minister and their mate. Outside perhaps an Indigenous football carnival, it was probably one of the largest gatherings of Aboriginal people across South Australia. Such was the high esteem in which Terry was held that the Ernabella choir, made up of community members from Ernabella, Mimili and Pipalyatjara, travelled a 3,600-kilometre round trip to acknowledge his commitment to their cause.</para>
<para>He recognised a need and so established the bipartisan Aboriginal Lands Parliamentary Standing Committee which had a positive impact on addressing housing, local government and infrastructure for Indigenous communities, and his work with Reconciliation South Australia was invaluable. Terry cared deeply about and was committed to advancing the cause of our Indigenous people. He walked among their communities, he walked their land with them. From education and health, to native title and Aboriginal heritage, no issue was out of bounds or beyond his understanding.</para>
<para>A man of gentle nature and remarkable patience, Terry would sit down and listen, taking in all that was said and working through ways of adequately addressing the issues that were raised. His commitment to the trade union movement, to the struggle to achieve social justice for the working class and to effect change for the disadvantaged—and in particularly Indigenous Australians—was unwavering.</para>
<para>Last Friday flags flew at half-mast around the state, including in Terry’s home town of Millicent. Just prior to the service, the South Australian Premier, Mike Rann, announced a special scholarship to be established in honour of the memory and contribution of the former cabinet minister and 20-year member of the legislative council. Terry cherished the time he spent with his sons Nick, Tim, Harry and Tom and partner, Julie. He shared memorable experiences with them.</para>
<para>Terry Roberts was not known as a man of few words. In fact, those that knew him knew that he was a man of many words. But when he left his office two weeks ago, unbeknown to him for what was to be the last time, he scribbled a note that he left behind, which quoted the words of former Labor Premier, Don Dunstan. It read, ‘There remains much to be done.’ And so, like the true believer that he was, in his own quiet way, Terry ensured that his work would continue. So few words on this occasion, but a volume of meaning for those that follow.</para>

<item label="(a)">
<para>Under section 232A of the Migration Act 1958, jurisdiction is proved if the intention is to bring five or more non-citizens into Australia. Those involved in the commission of such an offence need not arrive in Australia to complete the offence. Jurisdiction was not an issue in relation to the people smuggling offences in this matter. Two organisers of the SIEV X venture were identified. Mr Khalef Daoed has been prosecuted and convicted in Australian courts on Migration Act offences. Mr Abu Quassey was prosecuted and convicted in Egypt for offences relating to SIEV X.</para>
</item>
<item label="(b)">
<para>In these circumstances, Australia does not have any jurisdiction to prosecute a foreign national in Australian courts for allegedly committing an act of homicide against a foreign national, in a foreign country or international waters. As an Egyptian citizen, Mr Abu Quassey was prosecuted and convicted under Egyptian law for manslaughter and people smuggling offences in relation to the SIEV X. The AFP has worked closely with the Commonwealth Director of Public Prosecutions and the Attorney-General’s Department on this matter, with operational decisions being made on the basis of the available evidence. The conviction of Mr Quassey on charges relating to this matter in Egypt has precluded any future prosecution in Australia on the basis of double jeopardy.</para>

<para>AusAID has never issued such advice. The concerns raised by Senator Brown regarding 12 other NGOs are inaccurate. All Australian government funding decisions are made on a case-by-case basis and in accordance with the guidelines governing Australia’s various funding mechanisms. The Australian Government recognizes the invaluable role that indigenous NGOs play in developing a strong and vibrant civil society. East Timorese NGOs will continue to be able to access grant funding on a case-by-case basis through the various available funding mechanisms.</para>

<para>In support of their application, producers must attach a copy of the Australian Taxation Office Excise Return form that deals with the entry into home consumption of the ethanol for which funding is being claimed and evidence of the electronic funds transfer for the Duty paid on the ethanol referred to in the Excise Return form.</para>
<para>The Department of Industry, Tourism and Resources also receives Australian Taxation Office (ATO) statements from producers on the amount of excise paid on fuel ethanol. This information allows the Department to acquit the grants paid under the Ethanol Production Grant with ATO excise records.</para>
