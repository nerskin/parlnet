                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Senator FISHER</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">South Australia</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">12:34</span>):  by leave—Thank you, Mr President, and I do thank the chamber for its indulgence. I have really enjoyed the bulk of my five years representing South Australians in the Senate. It has been a privilege to participate in Senate committees. I tried to do my bit to uphold the integrity of Senate process and use it to ensure that the government and public servants explain their policies and processes in a way that is visible to the general public. I hope that my participation has helped to make a difference and contributed to an improved end result.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">For me, working on the National Broadband Network has been as enjoyable as it has been challenging. Mind you, with the earlier promised fibre to the node I was pretty disappointed, Senator Conroy, that you did not answer my call to, 'Show us your nodes, Minister.' Chairing the inquiry into the scrapped Home Insulation Program was both confronting in terms of the tragedies and appalling. I expect that all parties have learned lessons from the appropriate demise of that scheme and from what happens when a government with all good intent artificially skews a market and inflates a part of it without giving the ultimate beneficiaries any skin in the game.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I have long been a workplace relations tragic. I was honoured to work as senior adviser to former ministers for workplace relations Abbott and Reith. Neither bloke is everyone's cup of tea but they are mine and I owe each much. Whilst it did not please the government, I am pleased to have helped to have slowed the ultimate demise of the Australian Building and Construction Commission. Yes, I am biased, having helped former minister Abbott to set up the Cole royal commission into the industry. However, I am no more biased than the industry is lawless and I wish all the best to the new division of Fair Work Australia charged with dealing with the industry.  </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Most of all, I am proud to have helped bring about the appearance of the President of Fair Work Australia before Senate estimates. The coalition could not have done this without the support of Senator Xenophon and former Senator Steve Fielding. I thank both for always opening their doors to me whenever I wanted to talk workplace relations.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We are all accountable for our actions in one way or another, equally so a president legislatively charged with the efficient running and management of an arbitral tribunal. I regret that the president's attendance at estimates has been brought about by an order of the Senate and that the president is the only officer of a body appearing before estimates who needed to be subject to such an order.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">

              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">While I have moved from the country, no-one can take the country out of me. I have fought, along with others, for rural and regional Australia in this place, and will continue to do so outside it.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I am a bit bemused that my impromptu parody of the hokey-pokey and <span style="font-style:italic;">Time</span><span style="font-style:italic;"></span><span style="font-style:italic;">Warp </span>failed to set a standard for the ensuing pale imitations. To the member for Rankin: Craig, that was not singing and that was not dancing! I was trying to send a message about a policy that I thought was wrong. Afterwards, at field days on a Saturday in South Australia, in the south-east, 10-year-old Georgie said to me, 'Mary Jo, can you stay until Tuesday because I want to take you to school for show and tell.' That is when you know that you have reached an audience that you have not reached before.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Being a senator gives us, and has given me, an unparalleled opportunity to meet a huge number of people passionate about making a difference, be they various industry leaders, experts in their field or people just going about their everyday lives. This has been a great privilege and is a gift that I will cherish always.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Of course, I carry deep sorrow that my now infamous depression has taken me to a point where I can no longer ask the community to continue to support me in the Senate—a position of trust where consistency and predictability of conduct must be a given. I had thought I could make it. Perhaps my biggest regret is that I did not succeed in showing others, as an example to other sufferers, that there is a way to manage this illness while continuing in your favourite job. Luckily, many others prove that it need not be so, and that remains my challenge for the future.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">In time I want to continue helping people to build better lives, returning to a useful and productive community role. In hoping for this, I have been overwhelmed and humbled by the supportive and touching sentiments from the general community, many of whom I know not. Worthy of note is Edeltraut Blaubel, a woman who lives not far from my own old home in Adelaide and whom I had never met. She dropped into the office a few weeks ago with a handmade crocheted rug, in my favourite colours of orange and blue, and a simple message written to me: 'Don't give up'.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Apart from my long-suffering husband, John, family, friends and supporters in South Australia and interstate, I publicly thank my staff: Sanjay Kumar and Kristie Johnston, for solid contributions in my early days; Sonia Gentile, who stuck with me through the toughest time; and Bronte McQueen and Julie Thomas, who have been with me for all of it. Julie, Bronte and Sonia had a choice; they could have left yet never did. Julie, Bronte and Sonia: I tip my lid. A special thank you to the members for Goldstein and Mayo, Andrew Robb and Jamie Briggs, for their unflinching support. Thanks also to the professional and efficient staff of the Senate, many of whom have helped me immeasurably and separately from their professional remit. Likewise, I acknowledge so much support from this chamber both past and present: beside me and around me, from the crossbenchers, and from many members opposite. Some of the most helpful support has come from the most unexpected places: you know who you are; thank you so much. And likely to surprise many is my appreciation of the splendidly absent but also very important press gallery: you could have been anything but, yet you have been totally decent to me and then some. Thank you.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">In finishing, to Edeltraut: I may have had to give up being a senator, but like others in this chamber I will not give up on helping people build better lives and, in my case, on first getting myself better. My childhood home farm in Western Australia, Redlands, has so far been the home to two of Australia's female senators: my mum's sister and my aunt, Jo Vallentine, and me. Okay, we are a couple of decades and quite some policy positions apart, but I now draw to a close my chapter in our family's political contribution to our Australian way of life. Thank you to the chamber and thank you, Mr President.</span>

                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Western Australia</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">12:48</span>): The Superannuation Legislation Amendment (Trustee Obligations and Prudential Standards) Bill 2012 does a number of things. It increases obligations on superannuation fund trustees and directors both generally for all super fund trustees and specifically for MySuper trustees. It also gives APRA, the regulator, the power to issue prudential standards in relation to various prudential matters in superannuation.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The coalition strongly supports genuine attempts to improve corporate governance and transparency for trustees and directors of superannuation funds. The coalition also strongly supports improvements and enhancements to prudential standards in superannuation. All of us have to continue to work hard to ensure that we have the most efficient, the most transparent and the most competitive superannuation system possible, with the most appropriate corporate governance and transparency standards in place. Of course, we still have some way to go in that regard, but only the most efficient, the most transparent and the most competitive superannuation system possible will help to maximise value for Australians with superannuation and, ultimately, the value of the retirement savings that Australians have in their superannuation.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">However, the coalition cannot support this bill in its current form. The coalition will propose a very sensible and very constructive amendment that would significantly improve this bill by removing the government's proposed and unworkable scale test. This is because the government's version of the scale test is a vague and external test imposed on superannuation trustees which would make it impossible to administer in practice. As it is, it is already hard to attract properly qualified super fund trustees to these sorts of roles and the government, by making it even more complex and more uncertain for people who have to fulfil and take on those responsibilities, will make it even more difficult. If the amendment that the coalition very constructively will put forward is supported, we would be in a position to support the bill. If the amendment is not passed, the coalition will not be able to support the passage of this bill.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The coalition also has some concerns about a new provision in the bill that may impose personal liability on directors of superannuation fund boards to meet the collective obligations of the trustee board by introducing a series of new covenants for directors and deeming individual directors to be parties to the governing rules of the superannuation fund. It is important to remember that the Cooper review commissioned by this government into Australia's superannuation system handed down its report back in June 2010, and it made of series of very sensible recommendations on how corporate governance in superannuation could and should be improved.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The government and the current minister for superannuation has either outright opposed or been very unenthusiastic about embracing some of these very sensible recommendations that have been made by the government's own Cooper review on how corporate governance in superannuation should be improved. So there is a lot of unfinished and unprogressed business here that we think the government should start to act on.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The Cooper review specifically recommended that disclosure of conflicts of interest be mandatory. Given some of the recent events across the broader union and union dominated industry super funds movement I would have thought that it is pretty self-evident that disclosure of conflicts of interest ought to be mandatory. Directors should be forced to properly disclose their remuneration in line with the provisions that apply for publicly listed companies. And the Cooper review did recommend that there be appropriate provision for independent directors on superannuation fund boards, a recommendation that the government, and Minister Shorten in particular, has refused to embrace because his friends in the union movement do not want him to act on that particular recommendation.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Very self-evidently, a very sensible recommendation made by the Cooper review was that those directors who want to sit on multiple boards should demonstrate to APRA that they do not have any foreseeable conflicts of interest. This seems to be completely non-controversial as a very sensible suggestion. Yet the government's legislation here before us does not include any of these very important and necessary improvements to the corporate governance and transparency framework in superannuation, because Minister Shorten does not want to pick a fight with his friends in the union movement, who do not want him to make these very important and sensible changes to corporate governance arrangements in superannuation.</span>

The coalition will propose a logical and sensible amendment that would address significant concerns with this bill in relation to the scale test. In government, should we be successful at the next election, we will implement the sensible corporate governance reform recommendations made by the Cooper review that would see mandatory disclosure of conflicts of interest, the appropriate provision of independent directors on superannuation fund boards and which would force directors who want to sit on multiple boards and where there is clearly an apparent risk of conflict of interest to be required to demonstrate to APRA that they do not have in fact any foreseeable conflicts of interest. There is also the issue of conflicts of interest in relation to related party transactions that do need further tidying up when it comes to corporate governance standards.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Schedule 1 of this bill contains provisions for the following additional statutory duties for trustees of superannuation funds. MySuper trustees must promote the financial interests of beneficiaries, in particular, returns; they must annually assess sufficiency of scale—the scale test, about which I will have something more to say in a moment—and they must include in their investment strategy and investment return target and level of risk for MySuper members. Trustees of registrable superannuation entities, or RSEs, must give priority to the interests of beneficiaries where conflicts arise; must exercise the same degree of care, skill and diligence as a prudent superannuation trustee; must have regard to valuation information, expected tax consequences and costs in their investment strategies; and offer a range of options sufficient to allow members to choose a diversified asset mix. They also must have an insurance strategy and meet additional duties in relation to insurance. They must formulate, regularly review and give effect to the risk management strategy and maintain and manage financial resources to cover operational risk.</span>

Currently, APRA can issue guidance material on expected standards, but these materials are not legally binding. The Cooper review recommended APRA be given our standards-making power in relation to superannuation. The prudential standards would be determined and drafted by APRA, consistent with this schedule. They would be legislative instruments within the meaning of the Legislative Instruments Act 2003 and disallowable by parliament, and that is of course a change that we support.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Now the industry experts, including the Financial Services Council, have indicated very clearly that such external comparison will be impossible to conduct in practice, as a trustee will not have sufficient knowledge of other registrable superannuation entities in order to make a valid judgment and to meet this test. The scale test is based on a presumption that larger funds invariably provide lower fees and higher returns to members when demonstrably that is not the case. There is no evidence to indicate that this presumption is correct in all cases and, while we intuitively might be of the view that biggest is best, the evidence in the marketplace is that that is not always the case, and I am sure that the government would have received similar representations on that point as the coalition has.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The scale test, if implemented in its proposed form, could be another potential source of advantage to the larger industry superannuation funds because they have existing scale. The scale test would create a significant new barrier to entry for new funds by making it difficult for them to achieve the required scale from the outset, which would lead to a reduction in competition in superannuation which of course manifestly is not in the public interest. It may also lead to further consolidation and mergers of super funds that are driven not by an assessment of the overall best interests of members but by concerns about meeting this technical and rather arbitrary test. Industry groups have submitted that a better alternative would be an internal test based on a finite list of factors rather than on an open-ended and poorly defined external test that the government has proposed. In relation to this, it should be noted that the government's own Cooper review into Australia's superannuation system did in fact recommend that a MySuper product should have a scale test that was quite differently pitched from what the government has put forward here in this legislation. The Cooper review recommendation was that trustees should 'actively examine and conclude whether on an annual basis its MySuper product has sufficient scale on its own with respect to both assets and number of members to continue providing optimum benefits to members'. This recommendation, with the use of the term 'sufficient scale on its own' clearly implies an internal test rather than the open-ended and poorly defined external test that the government is proposing in this legislation.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Mr Acting Deputy President, that might all sound rather technical and it might be difficult to follow for those who are listening to this debate as to what the implications of this legislation are. Let me provide you with this very clear assurance, that what the government is proposing to do will make it easier and will further concentrate the power of the larger union dominated industry funds at the expense of competition and efforts to maximise value for all superannuants across Australia. The government's approach is contrary to the recommendations that were made by the government's own review and inquiry into this particular area of legislation.

                    </a>  Yes, union dominated super funds. And I can see that Minister Conroy, like Minister Shorten, is right on song. The government should withdraw this provision and then embark on a proper consultation process with all participants in the superannuation industry, not just with—and here you can interject, Senator Conroy—one segment of the financial services market, to achieve a more appropriate, a more balanced, a more competitively neutral and a more workable outcome than the current flawed proposal. With MySuper not due to commence until 1 July 2013, there is sufficient time for the government to go back to the drawing board and get this important provision right.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Proposed section 52, on the personal liability of directors, of the Superannuation Industry Supervision Act 1993 imposes a series of statutory obligations and covenants on trustees of regulated superannuation funds. These covenants or obligations are exercised by the board of directors of the trustees acting collectively. The bill replaces the existing section 52 with a new section containing enhanced statutory covenants that will be imposed on all regulated super fund trustees including MySuper trustees. The bill also includes proposed section 52A, which extends the covenants to individual directors of super funds. There is no equivalent provision in the current SIS Act. Proposed section 52A would make individual directors personally liable for any breach of the covenants by deeming them to be parties to the governing rules of the fund. The coalition strongly support enhancing and clarifying the law relating to the obligations of super fund trustees and directors. We also support introducing provisions that clearly deal with conflicts of interest of directors of super funds and which ensure that at all times directors of super funds put the interests of fund members ahead of any other interest including their own personal interest. But we have some strong concerns about the mechanism that the government has used in an attempt to achieve these aims.</span>

                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The bill tries to introduce covenants that are imported into the governing rules of every single super fund and then tries to bind directors to those covenants by deeming each director to be a party to the governing rules of the super fund. The provisions of section 52A appear to reverse the longstanding convention that boards of directors are jointly or collectively liable for decisions made by the board, including a trustee board, and that directors are only personally liable if they breach their directors' duties, including their duty to act with reasonable care and diligence at all times. The provisions are so broadly drafted that they may not provide certainty for directors who are trying to faithfully execute their duties so that they are complying with the law. The coalition is concerned that if implemented these provisions may discourage otherwise suitably qualified directors from accepting a role as directors of super boards. If high-quality inexperienced directors are discouraged from serving on superannuation boards by these provisions, it would have a severe impact on the quality of corporate governance of funds and on the performance of funds. This could result in lower investment returns and lower retirement savings for consumers because the best people to manage their investments have not chosen to be directors of those funds.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Again, the Cooper review made a series of sensible recommendations for reform of corporate governance and the duties of directors that have not been implemented by the government. The Cooper review noted the difficulty for trustees and directors in understanding what is expected of them under existing laws but it did not make any recommendation to extend the application of the SIS Act covenants for trustees to individual directors or for deemed directors of super funds to be parties to the funds' governing rules. They provisions of section 52A are confusing and they make the new laws even more unclear for directors especially given that proposed section 54A allows the government to introduce new covenants at any time in the future by regulation rather than by legislation. The coalition will closely monitor the impact of these proposed obligations on directors of superannuation funds when they come into force and will act in government to address any issues that may arise in the future.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The Cooper review did recommend, as I said at the outset, a number of changes which the government has outright opposed or chosen to ignore or only unenthusiastically embraced. There is a lot of unfinished business in superannuation, the most obvious of which is the need to ensure as a matter of absolute urgency that default funds under modern awards are selected through a more open, more transparent and more competitive process than is currently the case. The current arrangement by which default funds are selected under modern awards by Fair Work Australia is an absolute national disgrace. It is a closed shop, anticompetitive arrangement that is designed to favour the interests of union dominated industry super funds at the expense of Australians with superannuation. All Australians with superannuation should be able to benefit from genuine competition in the default fund market so that investment returns and the value of their retirement savings are ultimately maximised. </span>

                      <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Senator THISTLETHWAITE</span>
                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">New South Wales</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">13:08</span>):  I speak in support of the Superannuation Legislation Amendment (Trustee Obligations and Prudential Standards) Bill. Superannuation is the backbone of the strength of the Australian economy. Australia, a relatively small nation in terms of our population, with around 22 million people, has the fourth largest pool of savings funds of any nation throughout world. In March 2011 APRA estimated the value of the pool of superannuation funds in Australia to be $1.3 trillion. What does that money go towards? What happens with the money that is sitting in that pool of superannuation funds? </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">In a market economy such as Australia, savings equals investment. In other words, all of that money that is sitting in the superannuation funds and bank accounts of Australians is invested in our economy. It is invested in businesses, it is invested in projects and it is invested in infrastructure. That is what has been occurring in the Australian economy. That is the reason our economy performed so well during the global financial crisis. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Anyone who has been to Sydney recently would have seen a new building that has popped up: No. 1 Bligh Street. It is an enormous building, about 40 storeys high. It is the most environmentally friendly building in Australia, having a six-star rating. It is being occupied as a commercial premises being leased by companies. What many people would not know is that that building was built by superannuation fund members. They invested in the building and construction of that project, creating thousands of jobs for Australians and creating a hallmark for environmental standards in our country. That building was built by Cbus, the construction and building unions superannuation fund, the people that Senator Cormann says are a union dominated superannuation fund. It was a wise investment by a smart set of trustees on a superannuation board. That pool of investment funds creates jobs in our economy, jobs for Australians.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I mentioned earlier that it is one of the reasons why Australia performed so well during the global financial crisis. Last year the Association of Superannuation Funds of Australia engaged Allen Consulting Group to prepare a report. The report, entitled <span style="font-style:italic;">Enhancing </span><span style="font-style:italic;">f</span><span style="font-style:italic;">inancial </span><span style="font-style:italic;">s</span><span style="font-style:italic;">tability and </span><span style="font-style:italic;">e</span><span style="font-style:italic;">co</span><span style="font-style:italic;">nomic</span><span style="font-style:italic;"></span><span style="font-style:italic;">g</span><span style="font-style:italic;">rowth</span><span style="font-style:italic;">: </span><span style="font-style:italic;">the </span><span style="font-style:italic;">c</span><span style="font-style:italic;">ontribution of </span><span style="font-style:italic;">s</span><span style="font-style:italic;">uperannuation</span>, found: 'Superannuation funds were one of the main sources of equity financing for companies through private placements when debt financing became unavailable or unaffordable for Australian companies during the global financial crisis. The superannuation industry played a disproportionately large role in assisting corporate Australia to lower corporate risk during the global financial crisis.' During the global financial crisis we had instability in financial markets, with speculative investors withdrawing their funds—that money that ordinarily goes to funding projects, businesses and jobs in our economy. Because of the large pool of savings in superannuation, Australian superannuation funds entered the breach and invested and ensured that our economy remained strong. The crux of the report prepared by Allen Consulting is that superannuation in Australia is a winner—a winner for our economy, a winner for businesses, a winner for investment and a winner for members of those superannuation funds and their retirement savings.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">As the pool of superannuation funds in our economy grows, so does the risk. There is an increasing risk of fraud, and we saw that occur with Trio Capital. Senator Cormann and I sat on the Senate inquiry into the collapse of Trio Capital. In the case of Trio, predominantly self-managed superannuation funds but also industry funds were subject to fraud, and many innocent Australians lost money because of the dishonesty of a few unreliable business people in this country. We also saw bad investment decisions and of course a general downturn in the economy. Many Australians and many people throughout the world lost money in terms of their superannuation balances during the global financial crisis because of the general downturn in the stock market.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Any good government makes sure that, periodically, a policy or particular law continues to meet its objectives. Just like getting your car serviced, it is important that, as a government, we continue to check that particular laws and policies meet their initial objectives and are delivering for the Australian people. That is what this government did in 2009 with superannuation. We commissioned Jeremy Cooper to undertake a comprehensive review of Australia's superannuation system—to check under the hood, if you like—to see if it was meeting its objectives of delivering adequate retirement savings for Australians but also doing so in an efficient, effective, fair and moral way. Jeremy Cooper published his report in 2010 after a year of consultation with people throughout the industry. He made 10 packages of recommendations. They included things like increasing the superannuation guarantee from nine to 12 per cent and introducing MySuper as a default, simple product that people could access that had low fees, simple investment decisions and the like. He also, importantly, made recommendations relating to trustee governance and investment governance.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This bill before the Senate today delivers those recommendations. It ensures that we are providing better outcomes for superannuation members in this country. It ensures that they can have greater trust in the way that their funds are being managed by trustees of superannuation funds. The way that we do this is through three elements. Those three elements are: to apply new trustee duties to superannuation entities that offer the default MySuper products, to expand the general duties of superannuation entities that hold licences and to introduce a power for APRA to make prudential standards. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The enhanced trustee duties will apply to any MySuper product or an entity that offers a MySuper product. They will include ensuring that the financial interests of MySuper members are placed above any other potential interests or conflicts that may come. They will also include an annual determination of scale. This means that the trustees have an obligation on an annual basis to check that the financial interests of their members are not disadvantaged in relation to those in other comparable funds due to insufficient assets and to ensure that members get adequate returns for their investment. The opposition are opposed to this, but it came about as a result of a recommendation from the Cooper review. It ensures that those who may be involved in smaller funds with smaller asset bases are not being disadvantaged compared to those in bigger or middle-tier schemes and ensures adequate investment returns for members. The trustees will look at targeting investment returns and the level of risk. The target will be an expected return over an average rolling period of 10 years. The trustees will look at the investment risk and the expected return over a 10-year period and report that to members of the fund so the members can make adequate decisions about where to invest in coming years. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">There are also a set of new covenants or duties for superannuation funds in Australia and they go to the standard of care, skill and diligence that must be offered to members. A prudent superannuation trustee will be the new test which needs to be applied to the care, skill and diligence in operating a fund. Previously, the test was to apply to a prudent person, but the new test will be a prudent trustee. In relation to conflicts of interest, there is a new obligation on trustees to give priority to duties and interests of beneficiaries above all other persons and corporations. This ensures that the benefits and interests of a member are put ahead of any other potential decisions or conflicts that may arise that trustees have to consider.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">There is a duty to act fairly in dealing with all classes of beneficiaries. In superannuation funds there are different classes of beneficiaries who invest in different schemes, depending on what stage of life they are at. This obligation ensures that the trustees of those superannuation funds consider all classes of beneficiaries, not particular classes of beneficiaries, in the operation of a fund. In terms of investment strategies, trustees are now obliged not just to look at the whole of the superannuation fund and its performance and decisions related to investment strategy but to go a level below and look at different classes of investors within particular funds. That will include looking at matters such as the amount of information that is given to particular classes of investors, the tax that they may pay and any ongoing liabilities that they may have in respect of their particular investment.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Another obligation will relate to insurance. On an annual basis, the trustees of the fund will be required to assess the insurance strategy that they are taking out on behalf of members. The RSE will be required to formulate, review and regularly look at the insurance strategy for the benefit of beneficiaries. That will include looking at the kinds of insurance that are offered to members of the fund, the level of insurance that may be appropriate to each fund member and, of course, the cost of that insurance.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">A new obligation will be to assess, on an annual basis, operational risk. That does not mean investment risk; it means the operation of the fund and any risks associated with that. It relates to potentially failed internal processes and systems that may disadvantage fund members financially. Now, because of these reforms, trustees will be obliged to assess that risk on an annual basis. They will also be obliged to assess and develop a risk management strategy.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">There are new covenants for individual directors. Where the rules do not include duties, they are taken to be included because of this law. Those duties are to act honestly, to act in the best interests of members of the superannuation fund and not to enter into a covenant that would be in conflict with the interests of superannuation fund members.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The aim of all of these reforms and of the new interests and duties that are introduced by this legislation is to ensure better service, better results and better efficiency for members of superannuation funds by applying higher standards. Again, these came about as a result of the extensive consultation undertaken by the Cooper review.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The third element of the reforms is to ensure that prudential standards are improved. The law gives APRA the power to make general standards with respect to superannuation funds relating to prudential conditions. This is consistent with the recommendations of the Cooper review. The prudential standards will be available to be made on any matters including: protecting the interests of members; ensuring that the conduct of a superannuation entity or licensee connected to that meets the reasonable expectation of members; keeping an RSE licence or connected entity in a sound financial position; ensuring the conduct of an RSE licensee does not cause or promote instability; the appointment of auditors and actuaries; and the conduct of audits and actuarial investigations. Again, this is ensuring that the standards that relate to superannuation are improved and increased in our economy and that superannuation fund members can have greater confidence that the checks and balances related to their investment are increasing, and that ultimately, hopefully, their fund performance will improve.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Senator Cormann made much of the issue associated with the elements of the bill that those opposite are opposed to. He mentioned the timeline of 1 July 2013 and said that there was adequate time to reform this bill and to go through another process of investigation. That is not the case at all. Although MySuper does begin on 1 July 2013, it will take APRA at least 12 months to write the prudential standards associated with the commencement of this bill. That is why it is important that the Senate pass this legislation today. I reiterate the point that Jeremy Cooper undertook a comprehensive, close to nine-month consultation with those who work in the industry, representing all different facets and organisations in the industry. He called for submissions and there was the opportunity for super fund members right up to the associations to have their point of view put. So there has been adequate consultation in respect of these reforms.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The aim of this bill is to improve the governance of superannuation funds in Australia, to improve the efficiency and the quality of the superannuation system in Australia, and to ensure that beneficiaries are maximising the returns and getting better information for their investment and their retirement savings in our economy. It also ensures that our economy maximises the investment that can be undertaken through superannuation and the benefits for our economy that flow from job creation and growth.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I do want to make a point about the comments of Senator Cormann and his 'union-dominated superannuation funds'. The fact is that those opposite have never been supporters of the introduction of superannuation. When it was introduced by the Keating government in 1992, those opposite opposed it. They could not bring themselves to agree to a scheme that allowed workers in this country some say over their retirement incomes. That view has never changed, and here we still hear the rhetoric from those opposite about union-dominated superannuation funds. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Let us look at the performance of these superannuation funds: $1.3 trillion in investment income for our country, which helped us to survive through the global financial crisis, and investment in projects in infrastructure, creating jobs for Australians. Some of those so-called union-dominated superannuation funds are the best-performing investment vehicles in our economy. It comes back to the fact that those opposite cannot, and have never been able to, bring themselves to agree that workers should have a say in the allocation of investment portfolios and money related to their retirement savings. That is what this is all about. They have never got over the fact, and they never will, that workers and their representatives have the right to sit on superannuation fund boards and make decisions about the allocation of investment funds in our economy. Every chance they have had they have tried to whittle down and water down that system. They introduced choice legislation during the years of the Howard government because they believed that by introducing choice workers would flee industry funds and go and set up their own superannuation funds or go out and join corporate funds and the like. And what happened? The position of industry funds was actually strengthened, because the best-performing funds—</span>

                    </a>  As Senator Conroy points out, the cheapest funds were the industry superannuation funds. They were the best performing and the cheapest, so naturally workers and investors flocked to the industry funds. It backfired on the opposition and it will again, because this government is committed to increasing the pool of superannuation funds from nine to 12 per cent, to simplifying the system by introducing MySuper, to ensuring that Australians can have greater confidence that their pool of superannuation funds are being invested wisely and that the trustees' obligations are being increased. That is why this bill is necessary, and I commend the bill to the Senate.</span>

But we need to go further. The Cooper review into superannuation talks about the theory of 'rational and informed investors versus real-life experience'. Up until now the presumption has been to treat super fund members as informed and rational investors, which in an ideal world I am sure we all would be. But this is not an ideal world.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The report quotes from ABS figures which show that 46 per cent of 15- to 74-year-olds, approximately seven million people, would struggle to understand documents such as job applications and payroll forms; 53 per cent of people surveyed reached only the second of five levels in a practical numeracy test; and 70 per cent, or 10.6 million people, only managed to reach level 2 in a series of problem-solving exercises. The report states that the survey developers regard level 3 as the minimum required by individuals to 'meet the complex demands of everyday life and work'. Leaving that aside and apart from the obvious concerns this raises about our education system, it is clear that we cannot expect everyone to be a financial genius or even financially literate. Should these people—according to the ABS survey, the majority of our population—be disadvantaged? For many people super is something that is there to be thought about later; it is for old age. There are not many people I know who will voluntarily admit, even to themselves, that they fit into that category.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">But superannuation is compulsory. We do have some choice about what fund, whether we make voluntary contributions and whether we direct our fund managers or leave them to it. Ultimately the law says we have to have superannuation, and most of us do not make an informed choice. If the government uphold superannuation as compulsory, as it should be, then they also have a responsibility to ensure the sector is appropriately regulated and that consumers are protected. The Cooper review, which the government are holding up as the basis for these reforms, states:</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">… there is presently a lack of transparency, comparability and, ultimately, accountability in the Australian superannuation system …</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">That, clearly, is the nub of the problem.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">There is an unstoppable trend to increase transparency in the financial services sector, and that trend has in part been driven by a lack of trust in the financial services sector. I look to the work of those who have been campaigning for better governance and for better accountability over many years, such as Dean Paatsch of Ownership Matters and formerly of RiskMetrics. The key theme of the many opinion pieces that Mr Paatsch has written over the years, and his work, is about improving governance and transparency, and about getting meaningful information as to how your fund is performing and its compatibility with other funds. We just do not have that at the moment.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I applaud the government for the action it has taken so far and the further action it is planning to take, but there is far more we can do for consumers—for those who put their life savings, effectively, into these super funds. Firstly, consumers need to be able to make meaningful comparisons between funds. I acknowledge that there are provisions in the bill before us to require greater transparency from funds and for them to publish certain comparisons relating to scale. Clear and relevant information is important. Funds should be required to provide standard figures about returns, member numbers, fees, executive pay and commissions in a standardised format to allow for easy comparison. That is a given, and they are fundamental benchmarks. Ideally, however, commissions should not come into this question at all. Where there is an essentially compulsory product we need to move away from commissions, which are more likely to encourage risky behaviour on the part of fund managers and trustees.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I also note the provisions in this bill relating to conflicts of interest. I support the intention of this legislation, which is to require fund trustees to place the interests of their MySuper clients above any other interests. Ultimately, however, this raises the question of whether fund trustees should be required to disclose these conflicts and demonstrate exactly how they prioritise their interests. There also needs to be greater openness and communication on the part of the funds themselves. Funds should be open about answering questions in relation to their operations. A greater release of information would be likely to engage consumers with their funds, and provide them with the understanding and confidence to hold their funds to a higher standard.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Currently, for most consumers superannuation is all too hard. That is understandable, given the current complexities and the current lack of transparency. But as people get closer to retirement they tend to focus on their super more and begin digging through the paperwork, annual reports and carefully-worded statements to find out what all this could possibly mean for them in their retirement. Unfortunately, too many of them get a nasty shock and their last years at work are spent frantically trying to build up their fund to get them through retirement.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">But if funds provided clear and relevant information and focused on engagement and conversation with their members, consumers would benefit in the long run. Funds need to consider the idea of direct discussions with their members, either through AGMs or other meetings. This is something that must be structured into funds so that every fund member has the right to attend an AGM in the same way as for a public company. There must be ways that this mechanism can be put in place and that the information provided to members is meaningful information; meaningful comparisons so that relevant questions can be asked about the performance of the fund and the governance of that fund.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I foreshadow that if this is something that the government does not come up with in its next tranche of reforms then I believe it is worth moving specific amendments to the legislation so that there is that level of transparency, accountability and engagement for individual fund members to attend a nominated meeting or participate via online and ask the directors of that super fund relevant questions and keep them accountable. Consumers need to be empowered to ask questions and insist on answers, and we do not have that now.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">There are not many of us who would not complain if we were overcharged in a supermarket or restaurant. But because we do not have the information we need, we essentially can give some super funds a free pass. The basis of the Cooper report was that we need to move the superannuation sector from the idea of an 'engaged consumer' towards the idea of 'choice architecture'. The report explains this as the idea that if a consumer is financially literate and engaged then they should be able to make choices about their super funds, but if they are not then they should not be disadvantaged. According to the review, the super system should provide optimal outcomes for both. I strongly support this.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">However, I believe that putting further, easy-to-understand and comparable information into the public sphere will help to engage consumers in superannuation. This further accountability should also be a priority for the government, given the significant amounts of government expenditure on superannuation. Taxpayers deserve to know their money is being well spent and that the appropriate safeguards are in place. They also deserve to know that their investments are being protected.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">More importantly, there are issues such as long-term investment strategies and mandates that need to be considered. Given the importance of superannuation in our economy, both in terms of the investment and in terms of security for retirees, we should be opening the industry up further and encouraging funds to move away from liquid investments and more towards concrete investments such as infrastructure. I know that there has been a debate in the recent Senate committee hearing where David Farley from the Australian Agricultural Company talked about the importance of superannuation funds investing in Australian agriculture. I think that is a very real issue, and that if we had greater transparency and a more accountable system it would encourage that.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">While these types of investments may not have the short-term gains generally associated with super funds, they are likely to have better and more secure returns in the long run. Ultimately, we have been presented with the ideal opportunity to reform the superannuation industry in Australia. Given our ageing population and uncertainty about global finances, there has never been a better time. I can indicate my support for this bill, and I hope that this is only the beginning of this discussion and the necessary reforms.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">
                    <a href="H6V" type="MemberSpeech">
                      <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Senator BOYCE</span>
                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Queensland</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">13:37</span>):  I would like to acknowledge Senator Xenophon's contribution and the thought he has put into the issue of personal superannuation. One of the biggest problems that I see in this area is, of course, that lack of engaged consumers. People do not see their superannuation money—it comes out of their wages before they receive their wages—and, until their minds are focused by wanting to retire or a desperate need for funds, on the subject of super people often behave as though it is not really their money. So it is incumbent on this parliament not only to come up with good suggestions to make consumers more literate and to try to encourage them to engage more but also to make sure that the governance around superannuation is as good, as strong and as practical as possible. That is certainly something this legislation does not do. We have the usual charade from the government of dribbling through bits and pieces of legislation which leave all the stakeholders saying: 'We think the intention's good. We're a bit worried about the detail that we can understand and, of course, until we see the whole picture'—which they never do—'we can't say whether we support this legislation or not.' </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The Superannuation Legislation Amendment (Trustee Obligations and Prudential Standards) Bill 2012 that we are looking at will make a number of changes. It is basically part, but only part, of the government's response to the Cooper review in 2010. What has happened is that the government have picked out little bits and pieces. It is impossible to understand the criteria they have used for picking out the bits and pieces they have, other than thinking that very firmly in their view is the idea of ensuring that the union industry funds are well supported so that they can continue to support the Australian Labor Party. The first step in this continuing saga was the introduction of the Superannuation Legislation Amendment (MySuper Core Provisions) Bill in 2011. That bill established MySuper as a standardised, low-frills, no-fee superannuation product available as a basic option but not compulsory. It was intended to be the default fund that would be automatically chosen if employees did not make a decision. Now we have a second bite of the cherry in the Stronger Super reforms.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Certainly one thing that came through during our inquiry into this legislation was that the government's staggered release of bits and pieces of the legislation around super was not aiding clarity or consistency and it was creating uncertainty and confusion in the sector. Of course, the uncertainty and confusion are not helped by the fact that this bill also introduces new definitions and new trustees' duties which are unclear, not least because they depart from the current regime of trustees' duties. I cannot imagine anyone in their right mind choosing to be a trustee or a company director if they did not know what the rules of being a good trustee or company director were. So this will make it almost impossible for trustees and directors to comply with the legislation, because they cannot understand the core components of it, and it will expose directors to uncertainty and risk. Why would anyone take it on in that circumstance?</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The Law Council of Australia, in its submission to the Parliamentary Joint Committee on Corporations and Financial Services, said:</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">In order to promote compliance, legislation should be clear and certain. This is particularly the case when personal liability can flow from a breach—</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">as it can for a company director or a director of a superannuation fund.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">Legislation should also be consistent. There are examples where the Bill uses terms found in case law and other legislation, but in slightly different ways.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Pity the poor judge that has to sort out what that means—and inevitably, of course, there will be cases when this sort of confusion is apparently deliberately put into the law. The Law Council went on to say:</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">Again, this raises the question of whether differences in language reflect differences in duties or standards.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">So here we are dealing with a poorly drafted bill which rather than assisting the superannuation industry and the beneficiaries, who we need to remember are the workers of Australia, in many respects creates ambiguity and because of that increases the level of risk and the level of complexity and, of course—something that this government is excellent at—increases the level of red tape. Trustees and directors will need to watch their back because of the uncertainty in this legislation. In some ways I guess this bill captures the very essence of the government led by Prime Minister Gillard: it is poorly thought through, it is badly drafted and the people who will wear the consequences of it over time will be Australian superannuants.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">A survey recently by the Australian Taxation Office found that only 10 per cent of people were aware of the superannuation reforms that the Gillard government was undertaking. So much for engaged consumers! So much for efforts from the government to even try to engage consumers! I suspect that there is quite a happy group who think the less workers know about what is happening to their super the better. I would encourage people to take note because the government is doing a very good job of messing up what should be significant and useful reforms. And we are talking about, of course, the livelihoods and income of older Australians.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">There is currently $1.3 billion annually put into the super funds, and the industry is boosted, of course, by the compulsory nature of superannuation contributions, which are currently nine per cent but are going up to 12 per cent over the next six years. Once again I urge all policymakers to think about the need for people to see and be engaged with the taking of superannuation from their pay packets. I think Senator Xenophon's suggestion of an annual information night or something might be a starting point, but certainly superannuation bodies and the government are not doing enough at the moment to keep consumers informed about superannuation, let alone engaged in the question.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I would also like to look at one of the worst features of this bill: the scale test. We on the coalition side see that as a standout example of bad policy; and, unless there are amendments here, we will not be supporting this bill. We have serious concerns about the new scale test provided in the bill which requires trustees of superannuation funds, according to the explanatory memorandum:</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">… to determine on an annual basis that there is sufficient scale, in terms of assets and beneficiaries, such as to not disadvantage the financial interests of beneficiaries relative to the financial interests of beneficiaries in MySuper products in other RSEs;</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The first question is: how on earth does a superannuation fund know whether its scale disadvantages the financial interests of beneficiaries comparable to other funds? Industry experts such as the Financial Services Council have said that such external comparison would be impossible to conduct in practice as a trustee would not have sufficient knowledge of other registerable superannuation entities so that they could carry out this test. Is the government suggesting that we have open-book funds? If so, perhaps they should be putting some legislation through on that.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The scale test is based on a presumption that, the larger the fund, the more likely there will be lower fees and higher returns to members. Once again we have no evidence whatsoever to indicate that this presumption is true. It may be true in some cases, but there is no evidence to suggest that it is correct in all cases. Gut feeling might tell you that, the bigger the fund, the lower the fees and the higher the returns, but that is all we have here. There has been no proper analysis done by the government. There has been some fudging of figures by industry super funds to try to ensure that their funds look cheaper without showing the entire picture of the costs and the benefits of each fund.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The scale test, if implemented in its proposed form, would be another potential source of advantage to the larger industry superannuation funds because they already have that existing scale in terms of assets and beneficiaries. The scale test would create a significant new barrier to entry for new funds by making it very difficult for them to scale up to the level where they could be confident that, for the first year or so of operation, they were not disadvantaging the financial interests of their beneficiaries.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The scale test is also anticompetitive, which is not at all what I believe Jeremy Cooper had in mind when he made proposals around the scale test. He said in the Cooper review that MySuper products should have a scale test but that the trustees should:</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">… actively examine and conclude whether, on an annual basis, its MySuper product has sufficient scale on its own (with respect to both assets and number of members) to continue providing optimal benefits to members.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">That, of course, is quite different from expecting trustees each year to work out if their fund was the best fund. Where do we end up with this if any financial disadvantage is the issue? Do we end up with one fund? Inevitably some funds will function better in some years than others. No wonder directors are very concerned about this legislation.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The Association of Superannuation Funds of Australia said during the hearing that our committee conducted into this:</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">… the current wording of the scale test is problematic. On speaking to Treasury, we believe that guidance will be provided by APRA.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">That is wonderful, isn't it? APRA might provide some guidance—not some law or some regulation but some guidance. The Association of Superannuation Funds went on to say:</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">In terms of being able to provide for fund members, size of portfolio and number of members are certainly two factors, but there are other factors as well. In our view, fund trustees, as part of their best interest duties, have to look each year at whether or not they are able to provide services in the best interests of their members. So our initial view is very much that the—and certainly part of the consultation process—whole scale test may produce the wrong results.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The Corporate Super Association also said the scale test was unnecessary, and they took the view that investments and risk covenants for all RSE trustees are sufficient requirements, that trustees should not be operating a fund or MySuper product when assets and member numbers do not lend sufficient economies of scale to support a viable product.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I hope Minister Shorten is aware that in fact there is no correlation between the size of a fund and the size of individual portfolios within that fund, so why a scale test on this particular basis is included in the bill is beyond me. The issue of scale must be a matter of judgment, and legislating for an exercise of judgment simply will not work. We are giving directors rules that are impossible for them to function within and asking them not to use their own judgment on what they think constitutes being in the best interests of their beneficiaries but rather what Minister Shorten thinks might be in the best interests of the industry super funds. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The scale test is anticompetitive. Large funds will be precluded from investing in small and medium-sized companies. The bill actually legislates against one of the very foundations of an investment strategy: having a diversified portfolio. Not only do we have this as a barrier of entry for new funds; we also have this problem where there will be fewer funds flowing into small and medium-sized public company shareholdings. The requirements of the scale test will be difficult, if not impossible, for trustees and directors to comply with because there is no clarity around the terminology and there is a lack of certainty with the benchmarks against which trustees are required to measure their fund. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The coalition is particularly concerned that the government has picked up bits of the Cooper review in some areas and ignored it completely in other areas. I have no idea why you would try to improve governance by telling directors to measure themselves against everybody else in the market but not include some of the other governance matters Cooper canvassed. In the area of conflict of interest, for example, the government has completely ignored the recommendation for the disclosure of conflict of interests being made mandatory. Why has it ignored that? The disclosure requirements vary depending on the type of superannuation fund. And it is quite reasonable that publicly listed funds have more robust disclosure requirements. But the level of disclosure should be uniform across all superannuation funds because they are dealing with the same product and the same group of clients, the same beneficiaries—the superannuates of Australia. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Taking a lead in this regard, the Financial Services Council, which represents the for-profit funds—the people that one suspects the government rather dislikes—released a voluntary code in March in 2012 with the following features: superannuation funds must have an independent chair; the majority of directors must be independent; remuneration of directors and senior management must be disclosed when they are paid from the trust; directors must not hold multiple and competing superannuation fund board positions; the fund must develop an environmental, social and governance risk management policy that is made available to members; and the fund must develop and publicly disclose a proxy-voting policy and publish its Australian proxy-voting record. This would be an excellent code if only this government would pick it up and apply it to the industry funds. But the massive conflict of interest within the union dominated industry funds is exactly what the government is shying away from doing anything about. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">AustralianSuper, which is the largest industry fund, oversees $42 billion of retirement savings. On its board we have people such as Paul Howes from the Australian Workers Union and Dave Oliver, the ACTU Secretary. They are representing the interests—the individual interests, remember—of every beneficiary: the individual interests of 1.8 million workers. AustralianSuper invests in companies such as Woolworths, BHP and Rio Tinto. So I do not know how people such as Mr Howes or Mr Oliver can be on that board representing the best individual interests of the beneficiaries of the fund while, at the same time, planning industrial action against some of the shareholding companies. How does that work? How is that not a blatant and obvious conflict of interest? It is impossible to criticise a company by saying, 'Frankly, monkeys could do a better job,' which is what Mr Howes said about Rio Tinto, while, at the same time, saying, 'I have bought the shares in this company to assist our members to make a profit.' It is a ridiculous sham. This legislation must be amended. </span>

Schedule 1 of this bill applies to duties of trustees, including a requirement to give priority to beneficiaries over other persons where a conflict may exist. Trustees will also have expanded requirements in relation to their investment strategies. They will have a new requirement to develop an insurance strategy for members of their fund and a risk management strategy and also to meet a requirement to maintain financial resources either as trustee capital or as fund reserves to cover the operational risks of the funds that they manage. </span>

This bill also clearly identifies the duties that apply to the individuals who are directors or corporate trustees of superannuation funds, including acting honestly and in the best interests of their members. Schedule 1 will apply from 1 July 2013. Schedule 2 to the bill will provide APRA with the ability to make prudential standards. I commend the bill to the Senate. </span>

                  </a>  I had the advantage of talking to Mr Paris Aristotle, a member of the Houston review, this morning. He pointed out to me the very strong differences in approach in terms of using Nauru and Manus Island for the detention of people seeking asylum. I just make this point: the Pacific solution was premised on a belief that you should tell people they could not possibly resettle in Australia and to leave them to rot as a signal. That is not the approach that has been recommended here and it is not the approach in the legislation. <span style="font-style:italic;">(Time expired)</span></span>

Despite attempts by the opposition to misinterpret what has been said, I have read the report—unlike many opposite, I suspect—and that is not what the report says at all. The government has not been able to get its preferred option through the parliament. We therefore had the Houston review make a set of recommendations. I am impressed by the work they did. The central message in their response is to look at a no-advantage principle. I think that is a very interesting way of trying to bring together the various balances one has to draw in these matters, by focusing on a no-advantage principle—that there is no advantage in seeking to come by boat, but that you will get fair treatment and you will get an opportunity to apply for asylum.</span>

                  </a>  The obvious point to Senator Abetz is to say that we have adopted the recommendations of the Houston report. That will form the basis of legislation being introduced in this parliament, I think, later today. The senator and all senators will get a chance to debate that legislation if it is passed by the House of Representatives. It makes clear that it is not possible to turn boats around when the conditions are such as they are. Indonesia have made it clear they will not accept the turnaround of boats. The Indonesian government will not accept it. That is a very, very clear problem, and the report refers to other issues which make it unsafe and impossible in the current circumstances. I suggest you read the report.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Western Australia</span>—<span class="HPS-MinisterialTitles">Minister for Tertiary Education, Skills, Science and Research and Leader of the Government in the Senate</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">14:07</span>):  I thank Senator Moore for her long-term interest in this issue. The Gillard government is absolutely committed to delivering a National Disability Insurance Scheme. An NDIS will make sure we are delivering the kind of care and support Australians expect for people with a disability, their families and their carers.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">One year ago, we received and released the Productivity Commission's report into disability care and support in Australia. This showed that people with disability, their families and their carers were waiting far too long for the care and support they need. That is why the Labor government put people with a disability, their carers and their families first when we committed to an NDIS. The NDIS will end the cruel lottery that sees people with disability receive different support depending on where they live or how they acquired their disability, give decision making to people with disability, their families and their carers, and put choice in their hands so that they can make the most of their opportunities and fulfil their potential.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">That is why we are getting on with the job of delivering the foundations of the scheme. We put $1 billion on the table to fund the first stages of the scheme. We have established a new launch transition agency to run the delivery of care and support people with disability, their families and their carers. Applications are open for the $10 million practical design fund. I can also inform the Senate that in the past fortnight the government has reached agreement with the governments of New South Wales, Victoria, South Australia, Tasmania and the ACT for launch sites.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We regard this as a fundamental Labor reform, standing up for ordinary Australians. Like another great Labor reform, Medicare, the National Disability Insurance Scheme will provide comfort to every parent in the country. It will provide a solution to the very considerable neglect that people with disability have had to suffer for many years.</span>

From July this year, about 5,000 Victorians with significant and profound disabilities, their families and their carers will have their needs assessed and will start to receive individual care and support packages under the NDIS. This is an additional investment of more than $190 million by the Commonwealth in the Geelong region—direct investment in providing better care and support for people with disability, their families and their carers.</span>

To involve those Australians most closely associated with disability, the government is funding the National Disability and Carers Alliance to hold a series of forums across the country. It means that people from all walks of life can help shape the detailed design of the scheme. We have also launched an online forum, NDIS Your Say, which asks for people's views on key questions about how the scheme should work.</span>

I do not know how I have managed for the last six weeks without questions from Senator Cormann, but I struggled through! In terms of the MRRT, as you know, Mr President, I previously advised Senator Cormann that the forward estimate projections for the MRRT revenue are $13.4 billion. That was a revision down from the previous—</span>

                  </a>  Mr President, I rise on a point of order. It goes to the requirement for the minister to be directly relevant to the question. I asked the minister a very specific question, which was: how much has the government collected in MRRT revenue in the month of July? There is only one answer to that question that can be directly relevant, and that is a dollar figure in relation to the revenue collected in the month of July. If the minister does not know the answer, she should just say so.</span>

                  </a>  As I was going on to say, in the last budget we updated and revised the MRRT revenue to $13.4 billion over the forward estimates. As Senator Cormann well knows from questions in this place and in Senate estimates, the government acknowledges that the revenue take from the MRRT obviously depends on a range of factors such as commodity prices, exchange rates and production volumes. By virtue of being a profit based tax, it is obviously more volatile than other types of revenue.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">In terms of the quantum, the senator knows that I release monthly statements of the budget. Those are released every month from the preceding month, and he can consider those statements when they are released and made public, as is usually the case. I make this point about the position that Senator Cormann asserts.</span>

She is now making comment on what she calls the 'position' Senator Cormann asserts. Senator Cormann asserts no position. He merely makes an inquiry which the minister has told us that she is not able to respond to today. Nothing more can be relevant—directly or indirectly.</span>

Why is the government not in a position to provide the information I sought in relation to MRRT revenue collected by the government in the month of July when the Prime Minister made a solemn promise to the then Leader of the Australian Greens, Bob Brown, when refusing to release information about MRRT revenue assumptions and estimates like commodity price, production, volume and other assumptions. She made a promise, less than five months ago, to publish monthly updates on revenue collections from the MRRT. Why are you not in a position to do so today?</span>

If that is the case, you would not anticipate the first set of instalments to be paid until October. But, as I said, I will check that because I do not have a comprehensive brief on this issue. But I remind you again that we update our budget figures at each budget update and the mid-year review, and that is more than can be said for any costing that you have ever been involved in.</span>

Does the government agree with the coalition energy spokesperson, Mr Ian Macfarlane, but not its leader, Mr Abbott, that some state governments have been profiting from gold-plating electricity distribution systems, unnecessarily driving up electricity bills for ordinary Australians? If so, given COAG's slow and poor performance, and conflict of interest on electricity market reform to date, what confidence can the community have that anything other than talk will be done about it?</span>

There is a great deal of community concern about the increases in household electricity prices that we have seen over the last three years. I understand that in many areas prices have increased by more than 40 per cent, and that is obviously concerning to people faced with those costs, particularly people on fixed incomes, pensioners and other low-income earners. In my own state of Western Australia there has been a huge debate about this. People are very concerned by those rising electricity prices. </span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">On 7 August, the Prime Minister sought to bring attention to some of the issues that exist in the industry and to concern that things such as potential overinvestment in network infrastructure or the pricing around electricity by state governments may have seen consumers paying more than they needed to.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">In terms of the carbon price, the federal government made sure that the household assistance was more than adequate to cover any increases driven by the carbon price. But the ongoing increases in electricity prices are concerning. The Prime Minister, in asking states to bring possible remedies to the next COAG meeting, is trying to seriously address what is a major concern for families and households in Australia. While the implication in the senator's question was rather negative, I think that is not a bad starting point to try to focus on what we can do better to try to keep electricity prices down while maintaining a sustainable system. And, hopefully, COAG will make a step in that direction. <span style="font-style:italic;">(Time expired)</span></span>

It is part of why we have implemented a carbon price as part of our encouragement of alternative energy sources. I think people accept that household usage, patterns of usage and behaviour are an important part of energy saving. My own partner is training us all to turn off the power source—something I am not very good at yet, but it is part of that practical response to the problem.</span>

Minister, can you tell me which of the ongoing inquiries address the question of whether the national electricity objective should be amended to incorporate sustainability and climate change? So what is the evidence for the statement and which review actually addresses the objectives of the NEM?</span>

It is also the case that the family assistance package, shaped by this government, that has been paid to families across Australia, was designed to assist them in meeting some of those costs.

As the minister indicated, given that the Prime Minister and the Labor government have apparently had concerns about rising electricity prices for some length of time, why has the Prime Minister chosen to voice these concerns just six weeks after the implementation of her 10 per cent carbon tax on Australia's electricity prices?</span>

I do not know where he has been. He certainly has not been in Western Australia, where the Barnett government are getting hammered about the increases in electricity prices. I think you will find the Premier would accept that assertion. It is the case that we have been aware for some time of the growing community concern. It is why when we introduced a price on carbon we made sure that there was assistance that more than covered the cost of the increase, because we knew that people were finding it tough to deal with those costs. The Prime Minister is articulating the concern abroad in the community and we know that that is not driven by the carbon price; it is driven by other elements and addressing those is an important national public policy issue. <span style="font-style:italic;">(Time expired)</span></span>

If the Prime Minister and the Labor government are serious about the impact of mounting electricity prices on so many Australian households and businesses, why won't the government do the one thing entirely within its power to reduce electricity prices by an average of 10 per cent? Why will the government not simply axe its carbon tax?</span>

They also know that the family assistance measures introduced by this government have provided funding that is greater than the costs incurred by the increase in electricity prices driven by the carbon price. These are family assistance measures that the coalition seek to reverse. They seek to reverse the assistance we provided to meet the cost of paying—</span>

Our team hit the benchmark that was anticipated, of 35 medals, and while there may have been a few more silver than expected, each and every one of those tells a remarkable story. In fact, each and every Olympian's performance tells a remarkable story of both hard work, often over a lifetime, and each and every one of those performances has earned our respect and our acknowledgement. Somewhere around Australia those performances will inspire a young Australian to perhaps take up that sport for the first time, perhaps to try a little harder in their chosen endeavour, and so that wonderful circle of inspiration by our elite athletes, sustaining a system of high participation rates in sport across the country, continues.</span>

As sports assess their high performance programs, they do so knowing the rest of the world has been pretty busy in improving their own with more countries on the podium than ever before and countries including the host, Great Britain, having success that is unprecedented. I particularly acknowledge the Chef de Mission Nick Green and our flag bearers at the opening ceremony, Lauren Jackson, and at the closing ceremony, Malcolm Page, and take this opportunity to congratulate each and every person, Olympians and support staff and their families for such a fine effort in representing Australia so well in London 2012.</span>

I begin by congratulating the London Organising Committee of the Olympic Games for delivering an exceptional experience. As Australians we can be proud that since Sydney, in 2000, Australia's expertise in the organisation and delivery of major sporting events has continued to strengthen. In London there is an impressive list of 46 Australian businesses who played key roles in delivering the games.</span>

I also met Mr Manias whilst at the Austrade function I mentioned. For those of you who did not see it—I do not know how you would have missed it—the flame was made up of 204 smaller flames, each representing a nation taking part. It was totally different to any other cauldron that we have ever seen at the Olympic Games. It was a challenging structure to create and was widely acknowledged as being both elegant and beautiful, as well as being symbolically meaningful of the coming together of the 204 countries that participated. There were several others, of course. I met with Howard Croker from Croker Oars and Martin Schlegel from Advanced Polymer Technology, who made the blue hockey turf. I am yet to row the course at Eton Dorney and I will do that when I go back for the Paralympics.</span>

We have certainly received a number of submissions regarding the operation of the floor price.

                  </a>  It was a broad question. I can tell the senator that the government is not considering imposing a $1,300 per year impost on Australian families, unlike his party. I can tell the senator that the government is not considering taking back the tax cuts that we have provided. The government is not considering reducing the pensions and the family tax benefits that we have put in place to assist with the carbon price. All of those things of course are being not only considered but committed to by the Leader of the Opposition and those opposite.</span>

That modelling was, of course, very extensive Treasury modelling which was based on estimates of long-term developments and international carbon markets as well as the assumption, consistent with government policy, that we would link with markets from 2015-16. The fact is that we put out there the government's package, including the very extensive modelling, and that has formed the basis not only of the budget but of the policy costings. The government always updates its costings in the usual way, which is something those opposite do not do. The government updates its costings in the usual way in the budget and in budget updates, and that is the approach the government will be taking.</span>

Is it not the case that the carbon tax looks increasingly likely to plummet to its floor price when the fixed price is removed in 2015, and that the government is currently looking for ways to protect its revenue base from a major collapse? Why won't the government be upfront and honest with the Australian people about the major flaws in its carbon tax model?</span>

                  </a>  Taking a lecture on being upfront about their policy from those opposite, who will not even let me deal with their policy at all in question time, is really a little rich. The question is in fact a hypothetical. The government has laid out its policy, we have provided the Treasury modelling and we have been clear and upfront about the international linking that we are assuming in the budget and in the policy. We were upfront about that. Of course, the senator may not know that the party that opposes linking, thereby driving up the carbon price, is his party.</span>

I refer the minister to the National Food Plan green paper released on 17 July.

Why doesn't the government have a policy to increase the productivity of Australians for food supply? Is the government simply out of ideas about how to support Australian farmers?</span>

The Australian government is actively working to deliver the nation's first ever National Food Plan—a commitment we made at the last election. Australia's first National Food Plan is an opportunity to get the right policies in place for a strong, resilient and collaborative food industry that responds to our needs now and into the future. Senator Williams is correct to identify that the green paper, which is about bringing forward those ideas, bringing forward the issues, is the right vehicle to do that. I congratulate him on identifying that process.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">A growing world population and increasing numbers of middle-class consumers in Asia mean that there are significant opportunities for the Australian food industry in the future. The National Food Plan will ensure that the government's policy settings are right for Australia over the short term, the medium term and the long term. What the government announced over the break was the consultation vehicle, the green paper, which will lead to a white paper, which will provide the policy settings that will support industry.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">On 17 July I released the National Food Plan green paper, which outlines how current policies address food issues as well as discusses any potential changes the government might consider to policies, programs and governance arrangements. The green paper includes a range of policy options and I would hope that the National Party will in fact provide some input into the green paper on some of those options. These options include issues that cover food security: whether the government should regularly report on our food security and supply chains, issues around market access and how we can assist Australian producers to enter overseas markets. <span style="font-style:italic;">(Time expired)</span></span>

If the government is to be believed on its promise to increase Australia's food producing capacity, why won't it give consideration to the construction of dams that can help increase the security of farmers' water supplies? Why does a National Food Plan mention the word 'dams' precisely once and only with regard to aquaculture?</span>

The policy options within the green paper, as I was saying, include supply chain relationship, research and development, how we boost Australia's agricultural productivity through rural R&amp;D investment. It also includes—and Senator Williams may not have got to this within the green paper—infrastructure: what infrastructure power our industry needs to ensure that we have a sustainable industry into the future. So rather than settle on one specific policy outcome, as the National Party seemed to be stuck on, we need a coordinated infrastructure policy that deals not only with issues around water, land use, rail and transport, freight—all of those together—but also with how we can pursue those including issues around land use and the way we can ensure that Australia's land is used sustainably. <span style="font-style:italic;">(Time expired)</span></span>

Of course extensive stakeholder consultation is underway on the green paper so one would expect that under the headings of those policy options which included market access and issues around supply chain relationship, those who want to provide comment about how we improve and foster relations with overseas countries can be available to be included within the consultation for the green paper. It touches on foreign investment as well, and I am sure that Senator Williams has a lot to say about foreign investment, unlike his colleagues from the Liberal Party. <span style="font-style:italic;">(Time expired)</span></span>

Last week I released NBN Co's 2012-15 corporate plan. Important progress has been made by the government and NBN since the publication of the 2010 corporate plan. Since then legislation has been passed, contracts have been signed, firm agreements have been put in place and there is greater regulatory certainty. With this greater certainty the capital cost of the NBN is $37.4 billion, a modest increase of 3.9 per cent. </span>

And in May this year he said that 25 megabits were more than adequate for residential consumers. But just this week the Victorian Minister for Technology released a report from Deloitte Access Economics that finds, surprisingly, a strong demand for high-speed broadband, particularly for speeds above 50 megabits.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">Jump forward to today, 14 August 2012, and what do we, the coalition and the public of Australia, now have? After years of telling the coalition and after years of telling the people of Australia that Nauru and the Pacific Solution will not work, after years of telling the coalition and the people of Australia that Nauru and the Pacific Solution were neither humane nor fair and that the Pacific Solution was also ineffective and wasteful, yesterday former Air Chief Marshal Angus Houston—the man hand-picked by the Gillard government to advise them on border protection because the Labor government had totally abrogated their responsibilities in this regard—said that the Pacific Solution will work, and has in fact advocated a return to it.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">For years now, the Labor Party has been telling the coalition and telling the people of Australia that you cannot turn the boats back. Again, what did we have yesterday in the report that was handed down by Mr Houston? He has again said that there certainly are circumstances in which you can turn the boats back. For four years Australia's borders have been weak, lives have been lost at sea and Australia's reputation with its nearest neighbours has been completely, totally and utterly tarnished. Costs have blown out and people smuggling as a business has been allowed to flourish, all because those opposite—the Labor government and the Prime Minister of Australia—were too stubborn to admit that they got it wrong in August 2008 when they made the deliberate and wilful decision to roll back the proven border protection policies of the Howard government.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The last four years have seen what has been described as the greatest policy failure by any government in Australia since our inception. The Labor government inherited a solution. They were given one of the greatest gifts a government can ever be given when they take power, and that is that we had border protection policy in this country under control. But that was not good enough for those on the other side, and they set about deliberately and wilfully to dismantle the proven border protection policies of the Howard government. In fact, on 6 May this year—on that one day alone—more boats and more people arrived in Australia unlawfully than in the last five years of the Howard government. If you want further proof that the decision by the Labor government to dismantle the Pacific solution has resulted in disastrous consequences for this country, you need look no further than this statistic: under Prime Minister Gillard—under her watch alone—the number of people who have arrived in this country unlawfully has exceeded those that arrived during the entire 11 years of the Howard government.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The Labor government should apologise to the people of Australia for their abject failure when it comes to border protection. They should apologise for dismantling the Howard government's proven border protection policies, which they have now been told worked, stopped the boats and broke the people smugglers' model; they should apologise to the taxpayer for unnecessarily wasting billions of dollars, to the tune now of in excess of $4.7 billion; and they should apologise to the Australian people for offering a business model to the people smugglers who, by their criminal actions, have caused untold suffering to those who lost their lives at sea. <span style="font-style:italic;">(Time expired)</span></span>

Australians have had enough of this. They have had a gutful of this issue, and they simply want us to get on with it. Over the last five weeks, the Houston committee have been working on this issue. Yesterday they delivered their report to the Prime Minister, the Australian parliament and the people of Australia. There are a set of recommendations in that which, the committee makes clear, are a package. They do not want this parliament cherry-picking some elements of the package and rejecting others. They want it adopted as a package, because they see it as the only way that we can get a credible solution to this important issue and stop people drowning on the open seas.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">What are the Houston committee's recommendations? They recommend increasing the humanitarian intake from 13½ thousand to 20,000 and eventually, over time, to 27,000. The government has agreed to look at this and will implement this. They have highlighted bilateral cooperation as an important element of this package, something that the government has been working on with our regional neighbours, particularly Indonesia and Malaysia. They point out that the Malaysia negotiations are an important part of this package. Former Air Chief Marshal Angus Houston and the committee say:</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Small">The Panel recommends that Australia continue to <span style="font-weight:bold;">develop its vitally important</span><span style="font-weight:bold;"></span><span style="font-weight:bold;">cooperation with Malaysia on asylum issues</span>, including the management of a substantial number of refugees to be taken annually from Malaysia …</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">They recommend that the government continue to work on the Malaysia plan. They also recommend the reopening of Manus Island and Nauru. The government is giving that a tick: we are going to move to reopen Manus and Nauru. But, importantly, what they say also is that temporary protection visas will not work. An important element of the opposition's program will not work. They also say that tow-backs, under the current circumstances, will not work, and they clearly make the point that turn-backs cannot be done without the agreement of Indonesia. We have discussed this on numerous occasions in this place, and it has been in evidence before Senate estimates from Admiral Chris Barrie and others, who have said that it endangers the lives of Australian Defence Force personnel. It endangers the lives and the welfare of those in the Royal Australian Navy who have to undertake this dangerous tow-back policy. Is that the policy that you are advocating? Is that what you are advocating, despite the advice of the leader of the Australian Navy, who said that it would endanger personnel? The other issue is that people just disable the boats. They deliberately disable the boats to make sure that you cannot realistically turn them around.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Let us get on to the facts about this. The Australian public want the parliament to move on. Labor has accepted the recommendations of the Houston committee. We are going to implement them. We hope that we get the support of the opposition in doing that, but what this is really about is the fact that we actually have a solution to this important issue, and those opposite cannot bring themselves to agree that we have a solution on this.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">So let us look at the major issues affecting Australians. The economy in Australia is AAA rated; you cannot get any better. That is a tick for the government. The minerals resource rent tax has been up and running and is being implemented, ensuring that we are spreading the benefits of the mining boom—tick. The carbon pricing legislation has gone through and is up and running. The sky has not fallen in and what people have said is that it has not been disastrous—tick. Now we have a solution on the verge of being reached in respect of asylum seekers—tick. Now the focus shifts to you. You have to explain to the Australian public your $70 billion black hole in your election costings. The focus will now shift to you, and that is what this is about. <span style="font-style:italic;">(Time expired)</span></span>

                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Senator SCULLION</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Northern Territory</span>—<span class="HPS-MinisterialTitles">Deputy Leader of The Nationals</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">15:14</span>):  It is rare that I rise in this place to start my remarks by offering some advice to the other side. There are some times in life when you realise you have simply got it completely wrong. We have all been through that. It is a little humiliating. But my advice to you for the future speakers is simply to do it with some dignity. This is a humiliating but, I have to say, welcome backdown, and we need to acknowledge that it has come at some cost, and that is why we need to give it a bit of dignity.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">This has come at a fiscal cost—a contribution of some $4.7 billion—and there are 22,518 people who, if this policy had been adopted when the rest of the world knew it should have been instead of taking some cheap political position, would not have been forced to put their and their families' lives at risk. They came across in 386 vessels; and, sadly, those vessels were not in the finest of conditions, so over 600 lives were lost. Who would know what the real number is? Who would know the real cost?</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We also have the massive profits and underpinning of international crime. We are underpinning international crime organisations that are also involved in other people smuggling and smuggling in the transport of drugs. We know that international organised crime is a bad thing and yet we—not those on this side but this nation and those on the other side—gave them a reason to operate.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We have been asked to believe that somehow this is a different Pacific Solution. Again, those on the other side: Nauru is in the same place on the map. It has the same postcode; nothing has changed. In fact, it has exactly the same phone number. Certainly Mr Abbott has asked on no fewer than 130 occasions, pleading with the Prime Minister to pick up the phone, so it is not as if we have not known exactly what you need to do.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We have had some commentary about some of the positions in terms of turning the boats around. It is interesting to note what the Prime Minister had to say on turning the boats around. This was back in 2002: 'And we think turning the boats around that are seaworthy, that can make the return journey and are in international waters fits in with that.' She seemed to be flip-flopping a bit, though. She went on in 2010, very recently:</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Small">I speak of the claim often made by opposition politicians that they will, and I quote: 'turn the boats back'. This needs to be seen for what it is. It's a shallow slogan. It's nonsense.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">But then she had a bit of an epiphany. In 2011 she said:</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Small">They believe they are coming to Australia, but they end up somewhere else. It is a virtual turnaround of boats.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Sadly, we have seen flip-flopping on almost everything. On the temporary protection visas, back in 2002 she said people 'would in the first instance get a short temporary protection visa'. Again in 2002 she said, 'We want the short first-instance temporary protection visa'. In 2010 she said, 'The Rudd government is proud of its reforms in abolishing temporary protection visas—closing the so-called Pacific Solution'. I am not surprised that people are confused about their position.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We also had Senator Evans in this place. He said in 2008, 'the Pacific Solution was a cynical, costly and ultimately unsuccessful exercise introduced on the eve of a federal election by the Howard government'. I am very surprised those opposite are not standing up and simply admitting it is a humiliating but necessary backdown and treating this with the dignity that this issue deserves.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I urge all Australians, whilst those on the other side are now acknowledging the mistake that they made, to think for a moment, as we consider this issue and before we move on, of the vanity of four years. The cost of the vanity of the four years was 22,518 people, $4.7 billion of taxpayers' dollars that could have been spent on other things and, particularly, well over 600 people who, very sadly, lost their lives. <span style="font-style:italic;">(Time expired)</span></span>

                  </a>  that the contribution by Senator Cash on this matter was anything but dignified; in fact, I would have to say it was probably one of the most appalling contributions she has made to this Senate. It is because she has chosen to politicise this issue when we have now heard from an independent expert panel that has come out with a report that the government has in principle accepted which breaks the political deadlock and ends the politics. Instead of that, Senator Cash has to start the politics all over again and cherry pick the parts of the Houston report which suit her best.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">One thing that the expert panel made very clear is that the report should be taken as a package. The recommendations within the report should be taken as a package and should not be cherry picked. In fact, if one is to cherry pick as Senator Cash done and look at Manus Island, Nauru or PNG, they in fact are a very small part of this report—a very small part of a very broad package about how we address the issue of those seeking asylum in this country.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">One very important part of the package which Senator Cash chooses to overlook because it does not suit her political point-scoring is that the Houston report looks at increasing our humanitarian intake to 20,000 and, in five years, eventually to 27,000. That is so significant that it actually makes Australia a country with one of the highest humanitarian intakes per capita in the world. I am proud to be part of a government that is going to increase the number of people who are able to seek asylum in this country by accepting the recommendation to increase our humanitarian intake to 20,000 and then to 27,000. That is what I want to see my government doing, and that is exactly what it will be doing. </span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We are a welcoming country. We welcome refugees to our country; we do not demonise and denigrate them. Under the Howard government, we had 11 years of demonising asylum seekers in this country and the ongoing politicisation that followed. That is why we continue to be in a political deadlock with the opposition. They continue to refuse everything that is put on the table. We have compromised. We have tried to negotiate and come to an agreement with the opposition; but, no, that does not suit their political games. Now that the expert panel has come out with a report, the opposition continue to find a way to politicise and demonise the process, the ultimate process, for those seeking asylum in this country. That is incredibly regrettable. </span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">It is incredibly regrettable that Mr Abbott has not been able to resist that temptation, and neither has Senator Cash, here, today. In her contribution, she gave an appalling account of the issue of asylum seekers in this country. These are people in need. They are people who need very much our government<span style="&#xD;&#xA;    font-family:Tahoma;&#xD;&#xA;  ">'</span>s support, our parliament<span style="&#xD;&#xA;    font-family:Tahoma;&#xD;&#xA;  ">'</span>s support, to end the deadlock that has been at the heart of this issue. People in this place spoke very passionately and emotionally about this issue at the end of our June sittings, and it is now back with us at this time. Particularly in the last week of parliament, it was issue that we needed to address. <span style="font-style:italic;">(Time expired)</span></span>

Labor has grown deaf and blind to the frustrations of Australians regarding our borders. Yesterday was a day that Australians have grown tired and weary waiting for. During their wait, their cynicism about the national government and the political process that underpins it has been magnified and grown heavy. Across the country, Australians are tired of the politics that has broken the protection of our borders, shamed our reputation amongst our neighbours and risked the lives of many. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Much is open slather in the sport that is Australian politics, but this episode is gross ineptitude by a Labor government at its best, or it is the most shameful exercise of political survival. The embarrassment and shame of senators opposite is well justified. The government<span style="&#xD;&#xA;    font-family:Tahoma;&#xD;&#xA;  ">'</span>s reluctance to properly and comprehensively address our border protection priorities has come at great cost. There have been 22,518 arrivals in 386 boats since November 2007—a hefty cost to our border protection. In five years, more people have arrived by boat than in the entire period of the Howard government. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">In the hop, skip and a jump that is Labor<span style="&#xD;&#xA;    font-family:Tahoma;&#xD;&#xA;  ">'</span>s attempt to restore the integrity of our borders, the Houston report and more particularly the government<span style="&#xD;&#xA;    font-family:Tahoma;&#xD;&#xA;  ">'</span>s decision to embrace Manus and Nauru as part of a solution is a welcome but long-awaited first step. Labor<span style="&#xD;&#xA;    font-family:Tahoma;&#xD;&#xA;  ">'</span>s conversion to a more robust and effective position on border protection is taking too long. It is important and worthy to acknowledge the importance of this long-awaited recognition that offshore processing at Manus Island and Nauru will have a positive effect on reducing the incentive for vulnerable people to take risks. The government<span style="&#xD;&#xA;    font-family:Tahoma;&#xD;&#xA;  ">'</span>s failure to quickly endorse a comprehensive plan is staggering. That plan should be simple. It has been tried and tested and it has passed with flying colours. That plan is offshore processing at Manus and Nauru, it is the resurrection of temporary protection visas and it is a will to turn back boats when it is safe to do so. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">While the community has lost faith in Labor and its leaders, a group of three has successfully fulfilled the role of policy making for an inept Labor government. The Houston report gives Australians a road map for restoring their borders, rebuilding the pride of their country in the region and stopping vulnerable people from undertaking a risky path to a better life. We have a report, we have a road map, but we are still left with a government with a poor record of implementation. The question that Australians should now ask is: can Labor be trusted to implement a policy that they were reluctant to embrace in the beginning? The emphasis is important:<span style="&#xD;&#xA;    font-family:Tahoma;&#xD;&#xA;  "></span>'reluctant to embrace in the beginning'. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">In 2003, the Prime Minister was against offshore processing and the Pacific solution. She said that Labor would end the so-called Pacific solution—the processing and detaining of asylum seekers on Pacific islands—because it was costly, unsustainable and wrong as a matter of principle. As Deputy Prime Minister, her government dismantled the coalition<span style="&#xD;&#xA;    font-family:Tahoma;&#xD;&#xA;  ">'</span>s successful Pacific Solution policy. In 2008, her colleagues said that Labor was committed to abolishing the Pacific Solution, and this was one of the first things that the Rudd Labor government did on taking office. 'It was also one of my greatest pleasures in politics,' said Labor<span style="&#xD;&#xA;    font-family:Tahoma;&#xD;&#xA;  ">'</span>s Senate leader. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I believe that it is powerful reading to sometimes take note of the comments in our media, and today<span style="&#xD;&#xA;    font-family:Tahoma;&#xD;&#xA;  ">'</span>s <span style="font-style:italic;">Australian</span> newspaper is an important and powerful one. Sometimes it is easy to dismiss the powerful observations that are often made by our media commentators, but two comments today stand out to me. The first comment is:</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Small">… that the dismantling of the Howard government's border protection policies and their replacement with onshore processing has been a powerful pull factor behind the sharp increase in asylum-seeker arrivals by boat in recent years. The panel recognises that in order to stem the tide of asylum-seekers, this pull factor must be urgently addressed by implementing policies, including offshore processing, that deter people from undertaking dangerous boat journeys to Australia to seek asylum.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The second comment—and I will finish on this point—is: </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Small">… the Labor Party's decade-long vacillation on asylum-seeker policy, which has been defined by backflips, policy reversals and an irrational opposition to past Coalition policies that demonstrably worked.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">
                  <a href="e5z" type="MemberSpeech">
                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Senator SIEWERT</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Western Australia</span>—<span class="HPS-MinisterialTitles">Australian Greens Whip</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">15:29</span>):  I rise to take note of Senator Conroy's answers to my questions on Woodside's proposed development at James Price Point. I move:</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Small">That the Senate take note of the answer given by the Minister for Broadband, Communications and the Digital Economy (Senator Conroy) to a question without notice asked by Senator Siewert today relating to a proposed development at James Price Point, Western Australia.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I note that the government obviously have not thought about how they are going to undertake their decision-making process on James Price Point. I was not asking the minister about what the decision was. Clearly they are yet to make that decision. What I want to know and what the community wants to know is how they are going to make that decision. It is very clear that the Woodside environmental impact assessment document is unsatisfactory. It is not a comprehensive assessment of the potential impacts of this development on James Price Point.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Let us take the whales as an example. I was there myself last week and now have a fairly good understanding of the whale population in the area and also of Woodside's very gross underestimation of the number of whales using the area. They have so grossly underestimated the number of whales using that area and there is the fact that this area is a whale nursery and the home of the whales—not the Antarctic. The whales are born in this area; they are conceived in this area; they go to feed in the Antarctic and come back to give birth in this area. Woodside says that around 1,000 use the area within the eight-kilometre zone in the whole of the migration season. The community monitors, in a very scientific manner, have already, in the first five weeks of the migration period, identified 1,698 whales, including at least 99 mothers and calves, with some other sightings that are yet to be confirmed. In other words, this is a very important area.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I asked about the miniature spinner dolphins. Woodside is spending $80 million on an environmental assessment process—'It must be okay because we spent lots of money'—and, for a start, have managed to grossly underestimate the number of whales. The community-monitoring program has already highlighted the fact that they grossly underestimated it. They did not manage to find the miniature spinner dolphins. They spent $80 million but they did not manage to find them. Also, they did not manage to find the turtle-nesting sites. If they had asked the local community they could have told them where they are and the fact that they do use this area for nesting, but according to Woodside they do not. Not to mention the bilbies that they never seem to manage to find. That is just the start of the failures of the environmental impact assessment process undertaken by Woodside.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The government could not answer my question. They could not tell us how they are going to make the decision; they could not tell us whether they are going to carry out some independent monitoring. However, the minister did manage to answer a question I did not ask and, I have to say, I am quite grateful because the community do want to know what has been happening with their section 9 application. They put it in at least 12 months ago—you cannot rush these things. So I will take that answer back to the community and let them know that the minister is still undertaking that assessment.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Last week, for the James Price Point development, the Australian Institute of Marine Science carried out an assessment of the state government's own documentation and pointed out that the project will be a net cost to the taxpayers of WA and they will spend more money supporting this project than they will in collecting taxes. In fact, the impact of this particular development may lead to the loss of jobs in other places in WA. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">One wonders why the WA government are so strongly focusing on James Price Point when this particular site is an economic disaster. Could it be that they have other plans for the site? Of course, they deny this, but it is highly likely. Ninety-seven per cent of the workers there will be fly-in fly-out workers. So much for the myth that this is going to generate so much local employment. It will reduce the Kimberley's reputation as a world-class tourism destination, leading to a reduction in employment in the area's other largest employment sector. It will increase demand on community services, such as health and police, and cause inflation in the Broome region for housing and things like that, as it has in other places in Western Australia. This is a bad development. It should not go on country at James Price Point. The government should look at other places for that development and the federal government need to outline how they intend to undertake their assessment process.</span>

                  </a>  Senator Carr's disclosure to the Register of Senators' Interests shows that he has retained his shareholding in RJ Carr Pty Ltd, the private company he used as a lobbying company. Prime Minister Gillard's standards of ministerial ethics say that ministers must divest themselves of an interest in any private company or business. Whether or not this is an appropriate standard is not a matter for consideration; it is a test set for the Prime Minister. When challenged by Senator Abetz and me at Senate estimates in May, Senator Carr insisted that the issue of his retention of the shareholding was absurd and simply a bit of paperwork. I lodged a motion with the Senate and was in discussion with a member of the Greens regarding that motion when—coincidentally, the same day—Senator Carr came into the Senate and asserted that he had been advised that there was no conflict of interest in the retention of his share. </span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">
                  <a href="M56" type="MemberSpeech">
                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Senator PAYNE</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">New South Wales</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">15:54</span>):  I rise to speak on this matter of public importance which, by its very nature, indicates the necessity for discussion—again, the pattern of broken promises of this government, the expectations that have been raised and dashed and the commitments which have been given but remain unfunded. I am keenly aware every day in my shadow portfolio responsibility areas like housing, in particular, and homelessness that individuals who look to government for leadership in this space find that view sadly wanting, I must say, in the case of this government.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We are all aware of this government's track record of overpromising and underdelivering. The repeated discussions we have had in this chamber in relation to company tax, for example, would be a good start—again and again put forward, with the one per cent reduction promised on about 100 occasions. It is a ridiculous proposition for a business operator in Australia to be waiting for any certainty from this government, because it simply is not delivered. The last time that this promise was made—a promise that was due to commence less than two months after the budget—it was dumped without even being introduced to the parliament properly.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We heard today from the Minister for Broadband, Communications and the Digital Economy, Senator Conroy, about his personal white elephant, the NBN—which was of course promised in 2007 with much fanfare and with a cost, at the time, of $4.7 billion. Two years ago what were Labor saying about the NBN? They said it would be rolled out to 1.3 million households with over half a million paying customers by June 2013. That is not too far away, really, if you look at your calendar closely. But now we learn that the revised June 2013 target is 341,000 households with only 54,000 customers. What a convenient revision that is! And the price tag itself just beggars the imagination. We are looking at almost 10 times the originally promised price. That is just another example of Labor, as the government, promising the world for free and delivering very little at enormous cost. And I have not even come close to talking about the carbon tax, but I think I can rely on some of my colleagues to also address that matter here this afternoon.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I want to go to some very important issues close to my shadow ministerial responsibilities and raise the attention of the Senate in relation to those and the broken promises, the raised expectations and the lack of true commitment to funding. Last week, as many senators would know, was Homeless Persons Week—a time when many Australians took the opportunity to reflect on the situation of homeless people in our community and the work of those in so many non-government and not-for-profit organisations who do such an extraordinary job supporting and caring for them.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Many Australians are struggling to avoid the rising costs of living that are affecting their most basic comforts. In the middle of winter, that includes very simple things such as the heating of a home and the use of electricity to turn on lights. Those of us who have been in and around our electorates during the break and talking to our constituents have all heard stories from individuals, most particularly the elderly, who are finding this an extraordinarily difficult process to live through. Many of them are facing this with great fear and great concern.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">But too many Australians do not even have a home to heat, with families living in a vast range of circumstances—none of which are desirable—and, indeed, many children forced to sleep rough. And things continue to get worse, not better. Rents and mortgage payments are rising for many, especially at the lower end of the market. And the carbon tax itself will add thousands of dollars to the construction cost of new homes, for those who dare to put their toe in the water. That is an additional pressure on housing costs, which will push more lower income families into housing stress, rental stress, mortgage stress and, for some, into homelessness as rents become less affordable and housing costs become less affordable across the board. And not only are housing costs going up; insufficient houses are actually being built.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The national housing shortage in this country is something that I see many of those opposite often wave away with a swipe of the hand as though it is not important. But, for a country that depends not only on its own population but also on migration to survive and to sustain ourselves in the business market and the employment market, to have a housing shortage which was recently reported to have increased another 14 per cent to 228,000 as at June last year is a very, very scary statistic.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">It adds up to one-quarter of a million houses that we need but do not have. It is a fairly stark question for the government to respond to. In other words, a material percentage of the Australian population would not have access to adequate housing even if they could afford it, and we already have too many people resorting to marginal accommodation. Increasingly, without a demonstration of some leadership in this policy area, more and more Australians will be in that position and, frankly, it does not matter where you come from. It does not matter if, like Senator McKenzie from a rural and regional area in Victoria or, like me, you are from Western Sydney or inner Melbourne, the homeless and their families are absolutely everywhere and communities are becoming more and more alert to that problem.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Homeless Persons Week 2012, though, was marked by an ironic and extraordinarily unhelpful degree of uncertainty for homelessness services across the country. Hardworking services spent a lot of their week bringing homelessness into the national consciousness, they looked after families who were struggling to provide a roof for themselves and their children, but what was the government doing? It was largely talking about itself and making threats via the Prime Minister to the premiers that she does not like who sit around the COAG table. Where does that get anyone? The National Partnership Agreement on Homelessness, which was introduced to halve homelessness and provide supportive accommodation to all rough sleepers by 2020, is due to expire on 30 June next year. I have asked about its renewal during question time in this chamber and I have asked about it in estimates.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">In 2008 the then Prime Minister, Kevin Rudd, told us that homelessness was a national obscenity and promised that his 12-year plan to address homelessness would have significant results. In agreeing with the states and territories to new funding, he declared that that four-year $1.1 billion agreement was a 'down payment' on the overall plan. But as a responsible, hardworking Australian would know, putting a down payment on a house is just the beginning. You still need to pay the debt. We were attacked—many were attacked—for saying that that was a very significant target that the government had set for itself and for querying its real attainability.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The government cannot even measure its own progress now. The most recent minister in this area has stated that the government will have to look at data from the latest census to see how it is going. So, four years in, two years until the interim target of a 20 per cent reduction in homelessness is supposed to be met, eight years until homelessness is to be halved, the government cannot say whether it is making progress. Now, when it is asked how it will meet those targets, its plan appears to be to revise the definition of homelessness, to make a few global statements in its homelessness bill, to try to find some savings apparently to fund homelessness prevention and to ask the states for more money. In what appears to be an effort to stay afloat politically, it is really struggling to stay afloat financially.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The minister also says they will have to find savings to provide for the funding to extend the agreement. He cannot say how they will do this beyond June 2013. He is quoted as saying that the federal government have not determined the level of resources they could put at this point and, 'We would have to find savings to provide those resources'. So much for a down payment! So much for responsible forward budgeting! It is not trivial funding. There are about 180 homelessness services across the country that have no funding certainty from the middle of next year and many have reported that they are concerned that services with which they work may have to close early. Those services are lining up to warn of the dangers to those homelessness targets if the NPA is not extended.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Across the nation, we see people struggling every night. The government's response is not good enough; the minister's response is not good enough. To tell us from Finland and from Berlin about international programs and what he thinks they might do in Homelessness Week 2012 in Australia is not a good enough response to the people who are currently sleeping rough. It is not a good enough response to vulnerable mothers and their children and it is not a good enough response to people who put their faith in this government to mean what it says. They are profoundly disappointed and have every right to be. The government needs to do a much better job.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">
                  <a href="I0O" type="MemberSpeech">
                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Senator FEENEY</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Victoria</span>—<span class="HPS-MinisterialTitles">Parliamentary Secretary for Defence</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">16:04</span>):  I am pleased to rise this afternoon to make a contribution to this debate on a matter of public importance. When considering the subject of 'broken promises, raised expectations and unfunded commitments' there is no-one better qualified than those in the coalition to comment on these matters. In considering the contribution that I would make to this debate my first thought was that Labor had kept not only its most important promises but also the most central promise of all—a promise to manage the economy, to manage reform, to manage prosperity and to deal with the extraordinary challenges of recent times. That is a promise that Labor has kept and it has kept it in spades.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The government is returning the budget to surplus on time and as promised after what can only be described as some of the most momentous times in world economic history. Budget 2012-13 has cut spending by $33 billion—the greatest fiscal consolidation in the history of our economy—an extraordinary, remarkable achievement and one that means this country and this government will be heading back into surplus at a time when much of the rest of the world can only dream of such a scenario.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">When one considers the promises that this government has kept, the one that we can be proudest of, the one that affects every Australian, is that promise to manage the budget and to manage it well. Economic growth is expected to be stronger than in every major advanced economy over the coming two years: solid growth and real GDP of 3¼ per cent in 2012-13 and three per cent in 2013-14. Unemployment is forecast to remain low at 5½ per cent in the next two years. We saw only a few days ago that unemployment number again deliver a very strong result for Australia and again a number that surprised many commentators. No doubt, it grievously disappointed those who make it their business to talk down this economy. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Official interest rates are lower now than at any time for our predecessors and make a mockery of the boast that those opposite used to make that interest rates would always be lower under a coalition government. Well, the Australian people can now see that that boast was an empty one, and that in fact it is Labor and our economic management that have provided the lowest official rates in memory and delivered real and tangible results for mortgage holders across the country. By mid-2014, our economy is expected to be over 16 per cent bigger than it was before the global financial crisis, again outstripping the major advanced economies. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Despite a $150 billion loss of tax receipts since the GFC over the five years to 2012-13, the budget forecasts strengthening surpluses in each of the next four years, beginning of course with a $1.5 billion surplus in 2012-13. This year, tax as a proportion of the economy is just 22.1 per cent, compared to the 23.7 per cent we inherited from our predecessors. That means that this government is taking $24 billion less than our predecessors. The tax burden on the economy has shrunk and the proportion of the public sector as a part of the whole economy has also shrunk. So, of the whole mythology that those opposite have tried to build of big government, big taxation and economic failure, none of them bear the results. None of them are able to stand up to scrutiny, and clearly this government's economic management credentials sit at the very heart of its achievement in recent times.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Over 750,000 jobs have been created since late 2007, while around 27 million jobs have been lost around the world over the same period—again, an Australian result that stands in stark contrast to what is happening in the rest of the world. Of course, this is not unknown to Australian families. They sit at home and they watch the nightly news. They see Greece, they see Italy and they see the instability of the European economy and the Euro, and they comprehend that Australia is sailing very well in very fraught waters. Australia has strong economic fundamentals: solid growth, low unemployment, record levels of mining investment and commodity prices still around historical highs.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The strength of our public finances is a key reason behind Australia receiving a triple-A credit rating, with a stable outlook from all three major rating agencies for the first time in our history. We are now one of only eight countries that currently meets this standard, so clearly Australia is measuring up by international standards as well as by those very stringent standards this government has set itself.

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">So these extraordinary accomplishments have not gone unnoticed. This means that the government has already achieved bigger saving measures than anything the Howard government ever managed.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">These are extraordinary accomplishments; these are extraordinary promises kept, but there are of course others. One that springs to mind is the minerals resource rent tax. This was a very important Labor policy, one that was taken to the people and taken to the parliament. At its very heart, the minerals resource rent tax was about the principle that the mineral and resources wealth of this country belonged to every Australian in equal measure. While of course those who risk their businesses, their capital, their entrepreneurialism in exploiting those resources should be and are appropriately rewarded, it was appropriate for the people of Australia to take a seat at that negotiating table and say to those companies, 'You are experiencing superprofits as a consequence of record commodity prices—in the case of iron ore, a 600 per cent increase in the price—so it is appropriate that Australia and Australians get a bigger cut of this dramatically expanding pie'.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">That message has been understood. It has been understood by the people and it has been embraced by most of the industry. Now we see today that that promise has not only been kept but been kept in a way where we see the support of most of the industry. The proof of that is in the most extraordinary investment pipeline in the history of the Australian resources sector. In the order of $430 billion is now in the pipeline, with something like $82 billion in this year alone, which is up from $35 billion only two years ago. Clearly, there has been spectacular investment in the sector.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Those opposite, in railing against this eminently reasonable tax, have made two contradictory points, the first being that this tax will not realise any receipts and the second being that this tax will ruin the mining industry. They have not been deterred by the fact that these two claims are mutually exclusive. It cannot on the one hand beggar the mining industry and on the other hand produce no receipts for government. But this is just one of many anomalies on many occasions and in many critical debates where the opposition walk on both sides of the street and can be found on both sides of the argument. I will raise further examples. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">One of them is climate change. We see in the climate change debate the opposition pandering to those who insist that climate change is not real, that anthropogenic climate change is a fantasy, a fraud, and we see the opposition pandering to those who believe that climate change is real. The opposition hide the fact that their policy to abate carbon and their targets in that policy are the same as the targets in the government's policy. Again, we see them walking both sides of the street. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Sometimes this enters the world of high farce. Recently in the foreign investment debate we saw coalition senators, including Bill Heffernan and Fiona Nash, pushing for further strengthening of foreign investment rules only a week after the opposition had purported to land a policy on this very subject. I have said in this place before that we on this side are, within reason, sympathetic to the enormous challenge that Liberal Party senators have in herding the cats that are the National Party. We know they are policy eccentrics. We know that the National Party's understanding of the importance of foreign investment in this economy is little understood, but last week we had the Nationals calling for sweeping changes to a policy that was barely a week old. Deputy President, it is one thing to tolerate the eccentricities and strange utterances of the National Party when they are talking about our policies, but it seems they are now bagging yours as well.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Of course, when we talk about unfunded commitments we come to the most spectacular part of the hypocrisy of the opposition. When talking about unfunded commitments I must confess I am in the presence of experts, because this coalition intends to face the people at the next election with a $70 billion black hole. You have turned unfunded commitments into a grand new place. The coalition's proposal to abolish the minerals resource rent tax will cost the government exchequer $11.1 billion—and while that no doubt will earn you the lasting friendship of the 'Billionaire Liberation Front' in Perth, it is $11.1 billion that the coalition has to find from the budget. Its plans to axe the carbon price mean there are $24 billion in commitments to refunding the big polluters for carbon permits. But wait, Deputy President, that is not all. There is the $3.2 billion of taxpayers' money to fund the coalition's direct action plan. As you have heard me say before, this is a plan that Ceausescu would have been proud of, a plan that comes straight from the politburo of Eastern Europe: a plan to dispense with supply and demand and introduce the big five-year plan from Chairman Abbott.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">On top of these extraordinary commitments and extraordinary policy pronouncements, we see the coalition currently purporting to support $8 billion in pledged tax cuts with absolutely no idea how it is going to go about delivering that. We see it again in its policy on superannuation where on the one hand the coalition asserts that it is going to get rid of the minerals resource rent tax but on the other hand says it will keep the increases to superannuation that are funded by that plan. Then we have Tony Abbott in a brain snap, one might say, coming out with his own one per cent levy to fund his very own policies in the world of social welfare.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Again and again we see this opposition opposing a budget that has been managed second to none in the world and talking down an economy which is booming by any standard. We see the opposition itself hiding behind a fig leaf of a $70 billion black hole and a determination to be on both sides of every major argument confronting the people of Australia. For those who care to look at the detail of the political debate, can I commend the scribblings of van Onselen—not someone who could be said to be a Labor supporter, a keen enthusiast for the other side but someone who in recent times has been scathing about the opposition and the political opportunities they have squandered. His recent article was entitled 'A case of one bad government replacing another' and in his writings he has offered free character assessments for most of the Liberal Party's front bench. This is an opposition not ready for government, criticising an economy that is the envy of the world.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">
                  <a href="I0Q" type="MemberSpeech">
                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Senator RYAN</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Victoria</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">16:17</span>):  In that fantastic contribution from Senator Feeney we saw the very point of the motion moved by Senator Fifield. The modern-day Labor Party is really only expert at one thing, and that is in dissembling the English language and trying to redefine a reality that may work in the confines of this chamber for those on the opposite side and their Greens allies but does not work anywhere else in the community. We see at a state and now at a federal level a pattern of behaviour by the modern-day Labor Party that is all about raising expectations and breaching promises. They are irredeemable recidivists in this regard. It is the most potent aspect of what we might call the modern Labor disease.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I note that Senator Feeney did use the phrase, when he was talking about this government's record, that it kept its 'most important promises'. I do not think any Australian could legitimately not think that was a comedy performance, because it was this government and this Prime Minister who, days before the last poll, stared down the barrel of a camera and said: 'There will be no carbon tax under the government that I lead.' It is fair to say that politicians do not always have the best reputation in the community for keeping their promises. But can I tell you there is something particularly important about a promise not to do something, and that is why this government is going to be held accountable by the Australian people. It is why this side of this chamber and this side of the parliament will not let up on holding to account the Prime Minister and everyone who voted for that particular policy in the Labor Party.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">A promise not to do something is very easy to keep. It is not about suddenly finding there is not enough money to build three schools and you can only build two. It is not about finding that it takes longer to build a freeway so it is not going to be built in four years, it might be built in six. It is not even about telling a fib before an election about thinking you can build a new freeway or a new transport system and knowing that it cannot be done.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The reason this promise to not introduce a carbon tax is so lethal to our political system is it impacts on the level of trust politicians more generally are held in. It is because this government and this Prime Minister had to do nothing to keep it. It is a promise that required no activity for the government to keep its word. It is a promise that required the Prime Minister to do nothing in order to keep it. The Australian people know that a promise not to do something, that requires nothing to be done for that word to be kept, is a simple promise to keep. But, no, this Prime Minister, along with the Greens allies and the Independent allies in the lower house, decided that their interests and in particular this Prime Minister's interest in staying in the Lodge—those very private interests of the Labor Party—were more important than keeping faith with the Australian people. That promise to not do something, that promise that required no activity, no action, no measure of effort to keep, other than to stay seated and keep one's mouth shut—that promise will hang around the neck of the Labor Party and hang around the neck of this Prime Minister because the people, quite rightly, do not forgive them.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I note Senator Feeney also talked about this government's economic policies. He talked about so-called record cuts in spending. He also mentioned Europe, and what we are learning from Europe now is that so-called cuts against projected growth in spending, while spending in absolute terms increases, are not budget cuts whatsoever. This idea that we are going to cut budget growth from four per cent a year to two per cent a year in absolute terms but all of a sudden that means we are cutting substantially from levels of government expenditure is not a cut to the budget. A cut the budget is spending less next year than this year. It is a very simple equation that every household and every small business makes. But, no, to the modern-day Labor Party dissembling the truth, if I thought the budget was growing at a certain percentage and it grows at a lesser percentage I am going to call that a cut in spending.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Similarly, as has been pointed out often in this chamber, a government that counts revenue measures and tax increases as spending cuts—or 'saves' in the modern parlance used by this government and the Minister for Finance and Deregulation—has no credibility whatsoever, because spending continues to increase. When this government came to office, the Commonwealth budget was in the order of $265 billion to $270 billion per annum. It is now $370 billion just because over the last four years we have seen the most extraordinary rate of increase in public expenditure in this country, often on projects that are going to show absolutely no value for those bearing the debt in future generations and repaying the debt—the school halls fiasco, the insulation in our roofs, the general splurge in consultants and the numbers of public servants. That record rate of increase that was in the top three fastest in the OECD shows that somehow to simply say that stopping the rate of growth constitutes a budget cut or constitutes a real saving to the taxpayer is nothing short of a farce. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">This government can talk about its level of tax as a percentage of GDP, but what it does not want to talk about is the debt that it has run up. It does not matter if I am only taxing at 22 or 23 per cent of GDP if we are spending at 25 per cent because it is the spending that actually runs up debt. It is the spending that determines eventually how much tax Australians will pay. A budget deficit is nothing more than deferred taxation plus the interest costs. If in a financial year we spend $46 billion more than we collect in tax, as we did last year, that is just deferred taxation. It does not just sit there; at some point it is going to be paid. As we know, in this parliament in budgets today if we are not servicing the interest payments on the debt that this government has run up, there would be enough money in the Commonwealth budget today to fully fund the NDIS as recommended by the Productivity Commission. We are spending $8 billion a year on interest payments for debt that was run up in four short years of this government. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The performance of this government when it comes to the budget is nothing short of extraordinary. They came to office asserting in 2008 that the economy was too hot, that the 'inflation genie was out of the bottle'. We never saw the inflation genie again—we will probably see it again soon the way this government is going. The following year the government preached that the world was about to end so they had to justify spending money on overpriced halls in schoolyards, taking away the ability for kids to run around at lunchtime, and putting insulation in homes and hopefully not burning too many of them down.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">In the following two years it was, 'We have saved you from the global economic crisis.' Then for this last budget there was a promised surplus—that we know it is not going to appear—and even then it was based on funny-money accounting. We are spending and taxes were pulled forward and pushed back in order to confect and contrive a budget surplus. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">It goes to the very core of what the modern Labor Party are about, where the promise and the spin are more important than the substance. The Labor Party do not care that over this two- or three-year period we are still going to be running budget deficits in the order of $40-plus billion when you add them all up. What they want is a financial year when by pulling forward payments to local governments you can save a couple of billion dollars and by pushing forward some tax collections you can add a couple of billion dollars more to the collection size of the ledger. All they want is to somehow claim that in one financial year before an election they think, they hope, that they may have actually collected more in revenues than they have spent. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">But when you are just shuffling money around and not really cutting spending, that is not a real budget surplus. I am quite happy to stand here today and suggest to this chamber that there is no way a real budget surplus will be delivered by this government. Labor has shown that it is incapable of delivering a budget surplus. The issue of the finances of the Commonwealth and the budget goes to the very core of what modern Labor is about. Modern Labor is about raising expectations, the great moral challenge of our time that had to be dropped in order to save a Prime Minister's skin. They will say what they have to in the days leading up to an election: 'There will be no carbon tax in a government that I lead.' Then after an election they will say: 'The people presented us with a hung parliament. To stay in office I had to concede to the wishes and the whims of an extremist party represented by one person in the House of Representatives,' because to the modern-day Labor Party the ends do justify the means. Staying in office is all-important. It does not matter what you actually do; it only matters what you say you will do.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">It is a pattern of behaviour from the modern-day Labor Party. It has shown that it cannot be trusted with the budget. It has shown that it cannot be trusted with the promises and commitments that it makes before an election, even with those most basic ones where the government has to do nothing to keep its word. On the carbon tax it simply had to sit there and stay mum. It had to keep quiet and its promise not to introduce a carbon tax would have been fulfilled. History will condemn this Labor Party despite what people may say over and over again in this chamber, because history shows that it cannot be trusted.</span>

                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Senator MOORE</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Queensland</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">16:27</span>):  I think that Senator Ryan's last statement should be looked at very carefully. He said quite clearly that no matter how often you say things over and over again, it gets to some degree of truth. I am verballing you, Senator Ryan, but that was how I took your meaning.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The people on the opposite side of this chamber think that the more they can reinforce their own beliefs, the more they can restate their own feelings, the more that people in the wider community will accept that they are right. We know that the people on the other side do reinforce their own views on this issue because they keep talking about them; they keep using the same few lines. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I particularly enjoy the element of spin. I can say that over the last few months I could repeat word by word most of the arguments that we have heard this afternoon because they have been repeated word by word in terms of the one-liners about what constitutes debt and what programs in the past have not worked, and hours in this place have been spent on defining what is a promise and what is not. It does not matter how many times people on this side of the chamber and people in economic think tanks across the world—people who are not friends normally to the labour movement—consistently put on record as economic arguments that point out the process and the arguments on the policies which our government followed and have set up our country to be in an enviable position across the whole world, they still keep repeating the same spin.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">This is despite the comments that are made consistently—and despite extraordinarily unhelpful comments like that of the Premier of our state, Mr Acting Deputy President Furner, which compared the Australian and the Queensland economy with that of Spain. This is not only offensive to Queenslanders but deeply offensive to the people of Spain, who are suffering greatly from an economy that is in crisis and that over a number of years has degenerated to a position where people are not able to have an effective cost-of-living process or even able to look at their own welfare, their futures and their superannuation. Those countries, including Spain and various elements in Europe, are struggling greatly. Instead of acknowledging that and saying that together that we would be able to make a difference—even recently, where Australia was offering some support—it was ridiculed by the people on the other side of this chamber as us interfering and having the wrong view of trying to offer support. Rather than seeing how we can share knowledge and effectively look at the overwhelming issues that are impacting on the world economy, it was seen as a cheap political trick—an easy line for personal gain to make comparisons between our economy and that of Spain.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The important thing is that we acknowledge that everything that this government does is transparent. The process that this government follows in financial management, in arranging information, is exactly the same as for previous governments, and I hope that the same will continue in our country. We have a strong legacy of effective transparency of economic and government management. The Senate estimates process, which we all share in this place—sometimes to our joy, sometimes not—is the most effective mechanism of scrutiny of budget expenditure and scrutiny of policy of any government in this world, and has been acknowledged that way. As we sit in those budget estimates processes every six months and go through, line by line, the budget expenditure—actually looking at comparisons, seeing how the money has been spent, seeing where there is underspend and overspend and looking at how policy is implemented on the ground—that is the process which we all share with previous governments, current governments and into the future where we can identify on what basis modelling is done, on what basis arguments are put forward and on what basis policies are developed in this country.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">But it does not matter: if it does not suit the one-liners that people in the opposition continually want to say about the economy, it is disregarded. In fact, I think that sometimes disregard is better than disrespect, because one of the things that has happened in this place over the last 12 months has been overt disrespect for the Treasury officials who work independently of any government and provide fair and free advice on which policy can be developed to governments of all flavours. But because the answers are not what the other side want, we have seen that they begin to question the professionalism and indeed the integrity of the Australian Public Service. As you know, Mr Acting Deputy President, that is something that offends me and angers me probably more than any other policy area in which we operate. The role of the Australian Public Service is a strong and noble tradition in our form of government. Public servants are there to provide service and they are there to provide information and advice. And because oppositions do not like the actions that governments take, it is not an effective argument to disrespect the Commonwealth public service and, in particular, the Treasury benches.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I know that Senator Ryan has an obsession with the BER program. I was going to talk about mental health issues in this contribution but I think I might swap and go into the BER process; but I actually advise that if you are obsessed you can get help through mental health processes which our government has funded. When we hear consistently the BER program being brought out in debates such as these as being ineffective and a waste of money, all I can say is, Mr Acting Deputy President, 'Come and visit the schools that you and I have visited'. Go and talk with the people; not just the teachers and the students at the range of schools—and I have been fortunate to visit many across Queensland, as have you—but talk to the construction companies, talk to the architects, talk to the project managers and talk to the delivery drivers, all of whom were directly affected by the BER expenditure. This was a deliberate strategy to look at how we could respond to the global financial crisis.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I know that has been dismissed this afternoon in contributions in this place as another waste; I think someone talked about an 'exaggerated' claim. Check the figures! Find out exactly the crisis which our country was facing. The strategy which our government determined—which was a risk—to invest the amount of money into our education program from the federal level had never been done before. The programs that were being operated looking at public spaces, looking at libraries, looking at centres of excellence and looking at the wonderful science and trades training centres that are now sprinkled throughout our community were a significant investment not just in schools but, as I have said, in the wider community. The jobs that were created and maintained through that process will actually benefit our community not just now but into the future. That is not an example of a promise broken, it is not an example of poor economic management and it is not an example of inability to look at support of our community. That one program, which has been effectively demonised by a combination of the opposition benches and the <span style="font-style:italic;">Australian</span> newspaper, in itself is an example of where government can listen to community, can work with community and can come forward with an innovative way to build into the future.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">On that program alone I think our government stands and should be congratulated in terms of economic process. That is not to go into any other area where we have international economic organisations using the Australian economy as a test case to show—under deep threat and problems, looking at what was going on across the world—that we were able to build a future and to build up a process for moving into an area where there will be planning around economic surpluses.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">But in itself I do not think that just surplus or deficit can actually effect what must happen in economic management. The more important thing is to look at the community need, to listen to what the community wants and to work as a government responding to need. Alone, the increase in the social welfare payments to our pensioners—an increase never seen before 2009—and the way that people are now able to better survive a difficult times should be an example of where economic management responds to need and does not create undue expectation but does give the community an expectation of government listening to them, working with them and delivering not just in economic management but on effective, representative government. This debate can go on. There will not be new arguments put. Once again, it will be reinforcement of one-liners to make people feel stronger in their own position.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">
                  <a href="207825" type="MemberSpeech">
                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Senator McKENZIE</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Victoria</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">16:37</span>):  Senator Moore, I hope that I contribute more than passionately delivered one-liners to outline why the Gillard government's pattern of broken promises, raised expectations and unfunded commitments is being debated today in the Senate. I guess you have to start by asking a question in times like this: when does a pattern of behaviour become a predictor for future behaviour, and when do we get concerned about it? The three behaviours listed for debate today—broken promises, raised expectations and unfunded commitments—are pretty typical, or stereotypical, of the ALP model of governance under Prime Minister Gillard and, I believe, have resulted in a significant decrease right across our nation in the faith and trust that our citizens have in the government in general. When government speaks to the public and makes commitments to the public, I believe the public has every right to expect—wars aside—that the government will keep its word and can be trusted, and I think that is a fundamental principle of our system of government.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">When I go to broken promises—this is the one-liner, Senator Moore, that I will reiterate for those who have not heard it before—apparently, before the last federal election, the Prime Minister stated that there would be no carbon tax under a government she led. It is not the only breach of trust, but we will just dwell on the carbon tax for a moment. We now have the imposition of the world's biggest carbon tax. In 2011-12, the Gillard Labor government spent $100 million on carbon tax advertising without even mentioning the carbon tax. So, when we talk about muddying the waters and the conversation that the government is having with the public, that is a classic example.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Since the Labor government was elected in 2007, it has introduced and increased 20 new taxes. The Gillard Labor government's rhetoric about suppliers being able to pass on the rising carbon tax cost just is not the reality for small business owners in regional towns or primary producers right across regional Australia, particularly in the dairying heartland of our nation, which is the state of Victoria, now facing the burden of this tax. Businesses and primary producers are simply unable to pass on the increased costs arising from this tax, which is, amongst other factors, decreasing their ability to compete internationally.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">In my patron seat of Bendigo, it has been revealed that Bendigo Health will suffer under the imposition of the carbon tax. Bendigo Health is a significant employer within the seat of Bendigo. Analysis performed by the coalition state government has confirmed the stretched budgets that public hospitals will face under the carbon tax—between $1,000 and $2,400 per hospital bed per year. For Bendigo Health, it was outlined in a recent newspaper report that an extra $600,000 this financial year was the cost that the carbon tax was going to put on the hospital, taking the hospital's total gas and power bill to over $3 million a year. While the hospital said the bill was the worst-case scenario forecast, without exemption or compensation available from the Commonwealth public hospitals have no choice but to accrue debt or cut services. In regional towns struggling to deliver comprehensive public health services, this will be a challenge. By 2020, the overall impact of the carbon tax on Victorian hospitals and health services will be $143 million. It is expected to cost $13.5 million in its first year, rising to more than $21 million by 2020. The carbon tax will not save the planet, but it might well compromise Bendigo health services and the service they provide to the Bendigo community. Prime Minister Gillard is making it harder to make ends meet not just for Australian families but for hospital services as well.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">If we look at other patterns of behaviour which the Gillard government displays and which might be challenging the development of trust between citizen and state, let us look at the food plan and the Gillard government's commitment to agriculture. In the first five years of the Gillard government, Labor has shown a sporadic—and some would suggest schizophrenic—interest in Australian agriculture. Last month it announced the green paper, which will turn into a white paper—who knows when or where?—for a national food plan. This is despite the government, in the 2011-12 budget, taking approximately $33 million from the Department of Agriculture, Fisheries and Forestry over the next four years and despite the rhetoric from Minister Emerson on feeding the world and Minister Ludwig on the importance of agriculture. When we look at raising expectations and broken promises, the government's approach to agriculture and the agricultural communities right across our nation beggars belief.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">When we look at unfunded commitments, let us talk about the Labor government's commitment to mental health. Despite the stated commitment by the minister, projects in my home state have missed out, and they are significant projects which could make a real difference. I would just like to briefly mention Swan Hill headspace, a youth mental health centre. Swan Hill is one of the places in regional Victoria that have the state's highest incidence of self-harm amongst young people. In fact, it is seven times the state average for this group of young people in Swan Hill. They have missed out on funding, and the town is now struggling to provide adequate support services. The Labor government recently announced 15 locations around the country for new headspace centres, yet Swan Hill, with its population of over 10,000 people, was overlooked.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I guess the pattern of responsible governments that we would like to see is raising aspirations within the community—not raising expectations but raising aspirations, because raising expectations for political purposes with no intent of follow-through is negligent. There has been no greater example in recent times, I think, than the recent NDIS debacle.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The last thing we want to do is raise expectations for those most vulnerable within our community—the severely disabled—which is exactly what has happened around the NDIS conversation. The Prime Minister has failed to adequately provide for the first phase of the NDIS by only allocating $1 billion of the amount required to roll out the launch sites and has used the issue to pick a political fight with state premiers for her own political gain. If they have underfunded the first years, how can we trust that they will not underfund in the years to come? The Labor government has failed to commit to the Productivity Commission's target date for the full NDIS by 2018-19, and even that is six long years away for the most disadvantaged in our community to have their expectations raised and then dashed.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The NBN is another example of raising expectations. As a regional Australian, those expectations have been raised and raised. If only I could take Minister Conroy at his word on the delivery. The NBN's pattern of behaviour would predict it is taking longer and costing more to roll out than the Gillard Labor government claims. We heard that it will be finished by 2012, yet every deadline, every household target and every iteration of customer numbers has been blown out or missed and rolled forward. It was promised that by June 2013—next year—the NBN would be available to 1.3 million households and would have 566,000 paying customers. However, NBN Co. has admitted that its fibre will by June 2013 reach only 341,000 households, missing it by a little under a million and reaching one-quarter of the target, and will have only 54,000 customers, one-tenth of the target.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Costs have blown out, and people are sick of it as expectations are raised. Particularly out there in regional Victoria there are a lot of grumpy potential customers for Senator Conroy. They want cheaper, faster and more affordable broadband to drive the economic and social development of the regions, particularly in those towns of fewer than 1,000 people. I will not be able to go through the list of broken promises that I have before me, but I think Senator Payne mentioned the ALP's strategy of changing the language and definitions. It is all about smoke and mirrors to hide the fact that Australians can no longer continue to support the government when they cannot trust anything it says.</span>

                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Senator FAULKNER</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">New South Wales</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">16:47</span>):  Another sitting day, another ludicrous matter of public importance, another waste of time and another own goal from the opposition. The opposition, of course, have dredged the bottom of the barrel, and what have they pulled out? More over-the-top rhetoric, more bombast, more hyperbole, more exaggeration. But, if the Liberal Party want to talk about broken promises, I say good because, after the Howard government broke promise after promise after promise, the Liberals in fact achieved an infamous addition to the Australian political dictionary: the non-core promise. And didn't the Liberals chalk up a few of them.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Let's start with the one that everyone knows about: the GST. 'Never ever; it's dead,' said Mr Howard. Said Mr Howard, 'It was killed by the voters in the last election.' That was non-core to the core. Following in Mr Howard's footsteps you had Mr Abbott, who promised in February 2010:</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Small">We will fund our promises without new taxes and without increased taxes.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">But less than a month later he announced the paid maternity leave policy of the opposition would be funded by a new tax on business. At least Mr Howard kept his tax promise for a full term. Mr Abbott could not even keep his promise for a full month.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">And speaking of non-core promises, there was Mr Howard's claim that 'there would be no $100,000 university fees under this government'. By 2007 there were 104 domestic full-fee university degrees that were more than $100,000. Even worse, Mr Howard and Mr Downer grievously misled the nation about the existence of weapons of mass destruction in Iraq and led this country into a war based on a lie.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Another contribution to the Australian political dictionary eventually became the Howard government's own brand: truth overboard. Truth overboard and kids overboard went into the political lingo courtesy of Mr Howard and his ministers. We now hear in this MPI that the Liberals are appalled by raised expectations. Would it be unreasonable for the people of Australia to expect Mr Abbott to provide some vision for this country? Would it be unreasonable to expect Mr Abbott to put aside his reckless personal ambition, just for once, in the interest of the nation? Should we expect no vision, no cooperation, no common sense? Should we just expect 'no, no, no' from Mr Abbott?</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">For my part I admit I would rather raise expectations and even fall short than never try anything ambitious at all, because the Australia that cares for people when they are sick, no matter their bank balance, where they live or who they know; the Australia that respects the elderly and believes retired Australians should have the opportunity to live full and fulfilling lives; the Australia that gives you equal opportunity whether you come from Sydney or the bush; the Australia that believes in second chances, that, if a job or business does not work out for you, you should be supported through tough times and have the opportunity again; the Australia whose economy is the envy of the entire world; the Australia that cares for people with disabilities—the Australia that does this will not be built on people who are afraid of raising expectations. I am proud to live in an ambitious Australia. I would prefer that to Mr Abbott's Australia—the 'no Australia' of Mr Abbott.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Finally, the MPI mentions unfunded commitments—this from a political party, the Liberal Party, of gigantic blank cheques and bulging black holes. The Liberals have the hide of a rhinoceros straight off the African savannah to raise this issue. What a gift from the opposition to be given the opportunity to compare the credibility of the opposition's economic management to that of the government. You do not have to go back very far to reveal the opposition's hopeless record of costing blow-outs and budget breakdowns. They were exposed for it in the 2010 election campaign and they have even bettered it with their $70 billion black hole now. It was a black hole so big that it threatened to suck in the entire Department of Climate Change and Energy Efficiency and about 20,000 Commonwealth public servants. Of course we know that action taken by this government during the GFC meant that this country emerged from the GFC with strong growth, low unemployment and solid public finances. So while you have Mr Robb and Mr Hockey out the back with an abacus and a candle trying to figure out what the hell is happening to the budget of this country, this government is forging ahead with the same steady hand that guided us through the worst global economic conditions since the Great Depression. </span>

                <span class="HPS-Small">The Australian Government has worked closely with the livestock industry, state and territory governments, and animal welfare groups to develop a robust framework to ensure animal welfare outcomes in the livestock export trade. This consultation, as well as extensive engagement with trading partners, has led to significant supply chain reform through the development of a new regulatory framework. The goal is to ensure that by the end of 2012, all Australian livestock exported for slaughter will be treated at or above internationally accepted animal welfare standards.</span>

These reports recommended adapting and implementing a supply chain assurance framework for all markets for the export of Australian livestock, as well as addressing a number of domestic welfare issues. The implementation of these recommendations will require continued consultation with stakeholders. The Government is committed to facilitating the implementation of these changes. It will make $5 million available to support exporters to deliver improved supply chains. This funding will be available on a 3:1 investment ratio. The guidelines for this program are available at http://daff.gov.au/about/current-grants. A further allocation of $10 million from the Official Development Assistance (ODA) contingency reserve will be made available to eligible countries that import Australian livestock in order to improve animal welfare outcomes.</span>

Noted. The Government agrees that dialogue with financial institutions is important and has already undertaken a number of actions in this regard. In July 2011, the Department of Agriculture, Fisheries and Forestry commissioned Hydros Consulting to report on the financial impact of the cattle export restrictions on producers and service businesses in northern Australia. On 10 August 2011, the Minister for Agriculture, Fisheries and Forestry hosted an initial teleconference with key financial institutions on the development of the Subsidised Interest Rate Scheme, with follow-up discussions held by the Department of Agriculture, Fisheries and Forestry. In developing the framework of the Subsidised Interest Rate, the department also consulted the Western Australian, Queensland and Northern Territory governments. The Agricultural Finance Forum, comprising members from the financial services sector, agri-political organisations and government, meets on a six monthly basis for the purpose of improving communication between the rural sector, government and financial institutions on major public policy issues.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Small">The work of the Committee builds upon the 2010 Productivity Commission report, Contribution of the not-for-profit sector and assists in identifying how a capital market for the social economy sector can be developed in Australia. The Government has implemented a series of significant reforms in response to that report. In the 2011–12 Commonwealth Budget the Government announced a number of measures to drive major reforms in the not-for-profit sector and to deliver better regulation, reduce red tape and improve transparency and accountability for the sector. At the centre of these reforms is the commitment to establish a new regulator for the sector, the Australian Charities and Not- for-Profit Commission (ACNC). An implementation taskforce for the ACNC was established on 1 July 2011.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Small">The Productivity Commission also identified inadequate access to debt capital as a potential barrier to growth for some social enterprises and not-for-profit organisations. The Committee has further examined this issue, within the context of national and international trends in social impact investing, and makes a number of constructive recommendations in relation to: establishing a social finance taskforce; intermediaries and capacity building; education of financial and corporate stakeholders; promoting social investment products; strengthening social enterprise; and developing a measurement framework.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Small">Through the submissions and evidence received by the Committee, it is clear that there is growing interest and expertise in social investment concepts and practice across the public, private and community sectors in Australia. As acknowledged by the Committee, there are a number of initiatives being progressed across sectors that are helping to build the market and will serve as a valuable guide for future practice.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Small">The Commissioner of Taxation (Commissioner) has a statutory independence in his administration of the taxation laws which means that the Government cannot direct the Commissioner to administer the laws in a particular way. If the Australian Taxation Office (ATO) forms a view that the existing law may compromise revenue collections or have unintended consequences then it will be a matter for the Government to decide whether or not to amend the laws and, if so, then for Parliament to approve the necessary legislative amendments.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Small">If the Government chooses not to amend the tax  laws, then the Commissioner must decide on how he responds in administering the existing law. This may mean that the ATO needs to change its administrative practices and to amend its published view about how the law applies.  However, this is a matter for the Commissioner.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Small">In this context, it is worth noting that the Government also receives representations from a range of different entities (including individuals, businesses and representative groups) and that the Government takes into account these differing views before deciding whether to amend the tax laws and, if so, how to design the amendments.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Small">There is a significant risk that publishing ATO notifications to the Government about potential legislative problems could lead to uncertainty and confusion in the taxpaying community about how the ATO will administer the existing laws.  Dialogue between the ATO, Treasury and the Government may canvass a range of issues which could colour the interpretation of the existing law and existing ATO published views.  For example, the ATO provides various forms of public advice to taxpayers about the Commissioner's views on, and his interpretation of, the tax laws, such as public rulings, private rulings, administratively binding advice and interpretative decisions. Different types of advice provide various levels of protection against primary liabilities, penalties and interest to taxpayers who rely on that advice. It is unclear how a taxpayer would reconcile any published notifications with existing ATO views.</span>

Senator Sterle has correctly noted that there is no “one size fits all” approach for multiple export certification user groups. The blanket approach of subsidising service delivery costs, against their own cost-recovery policy, is part of the problem with the Liberal/National approach.

Activities include awareness raising and communications on research and other activities that promote sustainability. TSRA is committed to working with Treaty villagers on implementation of the turtle and dugong community-based plans.   TSRA has developed Community Based Turtle and Dugong Management Plans in all Australian Treaty communities. All the Plans have been officially endorsed by the appropriate traditional elders and clan based representatives of each community with the exception of the Kaiwalagal region (Inner Western Island Group), who are yet to update and endorse their Plan. TSRA are finalising the development of a regional catch monitoring database to store voluntary dugong and turtle catch data and create a tool for community education and community-based decision making in regard to significant pressure areas, implementation of traditional hunting closures and other culturally acceptable management tools. The analysed data, along with the Management Plans, will be used to assist PNG to adopt similar management arrangements for sustainable hunting practices in their Torres Strait communities. TSRA and other Australian government agencies are continuing to work with Western Province Treaty villages, PNG officials and other stakeholders to progress the development of community-based management plans for the sustainable use of critical marine resources, including turtle and dugong, in Western Province Treaty villages. This was a commitment given through Australia's bilateral engagement in the Environmental Management Committee (EMC), a consultative body for detailed consideration of Torres Strait environmental issues.</span>

These patrols have realised an increase in community contacts and  improved relationships with Papua New Guinean partner agencies.

In 2010, the Protected Zone Joint Authority Standing Committee agreed to the recommendations made by the review and many of these are now being put in place to streamline administration. For example, the Australian Fisheries Management Authority took over the secretariat role of the Protected Zone Joint Authority from the Department of Agriculture, Fisheries and Forestry towards at the end of 2010. This is expected to streamline administration and reduce duplication. Protected Zone Joint Authority agencies will continue to review processes and look for opportunities for improvement.</span>

The methodology provides guidance for projects that reduce greenhouse gas emissions through changed fire management practices across savannas in the tropical north of Australia. Land managers can reduce the carbon pollution from savanna fires by moving to an early dry season burning regime that can reduce fuel loads and create fire breaks in the landscape. This decreases the frequency and extent of fires in the long term, reducing carbon pollution.

                <span class="HPS-Small">The use of ventilation for passive cooling in warmer climates is encouraged. Second generation house energy rating software (adopted in 2007) is much better able to model the effects of ventilation. However, increasing rates of air-conditioner ownership indicate growing expectations for higher levels of comfort. To account for this trend, the simulation software assumes that air-conditioning will be installed at some stage, even if it is not installed originally. This ensures the house can adequately cope with heating and cooling loads should an air-conditioner be installed at any point. </span>

              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Small">The Australian Government welcomes the Senate Legal and Constitutional Affairs References Committee's (Senate Committee) report Donor Conception Practices in Australia released on 9 February 2011. This report into the complex and often emotive issue of donor conception is an important document that will assist the Australian Government in extending its understanding of the changing experience of many Australian families. The number of donors, donor recipients and donor conceived children living in our community is growing and this report is an invaluable reflection on the issues they face, particularly in relation to knowing their biological history. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Small">The report highlighted several areas of concern within the Australian community about the regulation of donor conception practices. Many of the recommendations in the report identified a desire for nationally consistent legislation regulating donor conception. The report also addressed concerns about consanguinity, importation of embryos and payments made to donors. The report also provided a comprehensive analysis of the record keeping practices of Assisted Reproductive Technology (ART) service providers. It recommended that there was a need for a nationally consistent method of maintaining and sharing information about donors, donor recipients and donor conceived individuals that will enable those concerned to access information, where appropriate, about their genetic history and relationships.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Small">The Australian Government has reviewed the report in depth and has considered all of the recommendations in great detail. The Australian Government is grateful to those members of the Australian community that dedicated their time to assisting the Senate with their inquiry and acknowledges the valuable input of the Australian community through their submissions to the Senate Committee.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Small">The Australian Government supports the need for the interests of donor conceived individuals to be protected but acknowledges that there is no constitutional power that would support a Commonwealth scheme to legislate comprehensively in this area. States and Territories are responsible for enacting legislation regulating donor conception practices in Australia. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Small">For many years the Australian Government has recognised the need for improvements in the regulation of assisted reproductive technology, particularly as the number of affected individuals in Australian society increases. The Australian Government has shown leadership in this area by establishing and continuing to support the National Health and Medical Research Council (NHMRC) and the Australian Health Ethics Committee (AHEC), which in turn provides ethical guidelines on the use of ART in clinical practice and research. As early as 1996, the AHEC took a leading role, developing guidelines stating that ART service providers should obtain accreditation by a recognised body and that such accreditation should require compliance with those guidelines. The 1996 guidelines also strongly recommended that States and Territories that had not already done so should enact legislation to regulate ART. These guidelines have been consistently reviewed since that time and have resulted in the very comprehensive Ethical guidelines on the use of assisted reproductive technology in clinical practice and research 2007 (NHMRC ART Guidelines) that provide a high level of guidance to the ART industry today. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Small">The NHMRC ART Guidelines represent a significant body of work and dedication of resources by the Australian Government to assist with the protection of the interests of donors, donor recipients and donor conceived children.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Small">The NHMRC ART Guidelines are aligned with many of the recommendations contained in the Senate report. They provide a nationally consistent basis upon which other States and Territories may wish to develop regulation in this area. The Australian Government supports the use of the NHMRC ART Guidelines by States and Territories contemplating regulation of donor conception practices. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Small">In addition, there has already been a national accreditation scheme developed in Australia that supports compliance with the NHMRC ART Guidelines. Although States and Territories may use an accreditation or licensing system unique to their jurisdiction to regulate the ART industry, a robust accreditation system that is independently reviewed and assessed has already been established by the Reproductive Technology Accreditation Committee (RTAC). RTAC was established in 1987 by the Fertility Society of Australia, the peak body representing doctors, scientists, nurses, researchers, consumers and counsellors involved in reproductive medicine. The RTAC accreditation scheme was developed by a combined technical committee comprising members from the Joint Accreditation System of Australia and New Zealand (JAS-ANZ) and RTAC in accordance with international and domestic standards for bodies that operate product certification systems. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Small">To obtain accreditation through RTAC, an ART service provider must obtain RTAC certification from an independent third party JAS-ANZ-accredited certification body, which measures the organisations compliance with the RTAC Code of Practice for Assisted Reproductive Technology Units (the RTAC Code of Practice).  The certification body makes recommendations to RTAC about whether RTAC should grant a licence. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Small">The RTAC Code of Practice requires as part of its compulsory criteria that an ART service provider must comply with the NHMRC ART Guidelines. In States and Territories that have not passed legislation requiring ART providers to obtain an RTAC licence, many ART service providers voluntarily participate in the accreditation scheme which requires them to comply with the NHMRC ART Guidelines and the RTAC Code of Practice. Where States and Territories have passed legislation, ART service providers may often also be compelled to comply with State based licensing schemes. To date, Victoria, New South Wales, South Australia and Western Australia have enacted legislation that specifically regulates donor conception practices. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Small">States and Territories looking to regulate the ART industry have the opportunity to make use of two significant national resources. One supported by the Australian Government through the development of the NHMRC ART Guidelines and the other by the Fertility Society of Australia, through the RTAC Code of Practice and the development of a robust accreditation system.  The Australian Government encourages States and Territories, who have not already done so, to implement a legislative framework that will mandate compliance with the established accreditation and regulatory scheme. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Small">Using the RTAC accreditation process and the NHMRC ART Guidelines as the basis for legislative frameworks will ensure consistent approaches to donor conception across Australia. States and Territories also have the option of ensuring compliance with the regulatory framework through making provisions in their legislation for offences and penalties for ART service providers who do not comply with the national standards. In addition, individual Australians who are involved in ART procedures can assist in the protection of their interests and those of their donor conceived children by using the services of accredited facilities. In cases of non-compliance by accredited ART service providers, individuals are encouraged to avail themselves of the proper channels for making health related complaints, by contacting the Health Complaints Commissioner or equivalent in the relevant State or Territory.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Small">The Australian Government notes the benefits to the continuing refinement and improvement of the NHMRC ART Guidelines, through NHMRC's policy of revising guidelines every five years. This will ensure that the national standard in Australia continues to provide a high level of protection for Australians who are conceived through the use of ART technologies. The Australian Government thanks the Senate Committee for the outstanding contribution their report provides to the development of policy on donor conception.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Small">The committee recommends that jurisdictions which do not already have legislation in place, namely Queensland, Tasmania, the Northern Territory, and the Australian Capital Territory, should, as a matter of priority, establish legislation to regulate donor conception in those jurisdictions. </span>

              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Small">The Australian Government supports this recommendation.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Small">This recommendation is consistent with recommendations published by the NHMRC in the 2007 NHMRC ART Guidelines. States and Territories are responsible for the enactment of legislation in their respective jurisdictions. The Australian Government encourages those States and Territories that do not currently have legislation regulating donor conception practices to establish such legislation. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Small">The Australian Government also supports consistency of State and Territory legislation. Consistent legislation will ensure that donors, donor recipients and donor conceived individuals will have the same access to information regardless of which jurisdiction they are in. It will also discourage the practice of forum shopping for persons who wish to donate or who wish to use ART services. The NHMRC ART Guidelines developed by the NHMRC and the RTAC accreditation system provide a sound basis for State and Territory legislation.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Small">The committee recommends that the Australian Government pursue all available policy and political options, including through the Council of Australian Governments and the Standing Committee of Attorneys-General, to ensure that nationally consistent legislation relating to donor conception is developed as a matter of priority. </span>

              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Small">The Australian Government does not have constitutional power to legislate comprehensively in this area to ensure that legislation is nationally consistent. The Australian Government supports consistency of regulation of donor conception practices across Australia and has been working to progress the issue with States and Territories. The issue of donor conception laws has been a stand-alone agenda item on the Standing Council of Law and Justice (formerly the Standing Committee of Attorneys-General) since April 2009. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Small">As identified in the Senate report, in 2002 the Council of Australian Governments (COAG) agreed that RTAC-accreditation should provide the basis for a nationally consistent approach to the oversight of ART clinical practice and research in Australia. To be accredited an ART service provider must obtain an RTAC licence, which requires compliance with the RTAC Certification Scheme and the RTAC Code of Practice which were last revised in October 2010. The RTAC Code of Practice, in turn, requires compliance with the NHMRC ART Guidelines. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Small">The NHMRC ART Guidelines and RTAC accreditation system provide a nationally consistent basis upon which States and Territories who have not done so, may wish to develop regulation in this area. The NHMRC ART Guidelines provide ethical guidance, in line with many of the issues raised by the recommendations in the Senate report, to clinical practitioners who provide ART services. The NHMRC ART Guidelines address issues such as the provision of counselling services to participants, collection and dissemination of information and consent.  The RTAC Code of Practice ensures that the clinical delivery of ART services is as risk free and as of high quality as possible. The Australian Government and the Fertility Society of Australia have demonstrated leadership and have encouraged States and Territories for many years, to give legislative force to the NHMRC ART Guidelines through the RTAC accreditation system to improve consistency of donor conception regulation across jurisdictions. </span>

The Australian Government encourages the Australian public to use ART service providers who participate in the RTAC accreditation; consistent with this, Medicare benefits are only paid to RTAC accredited providers. It is a matter for States and Territories whether additional penalties for non-compliance other than the withdrawal of an RTAC licence are warranted. </span>

                <span class="HPS-Small">In 2007 the Australian Government reviewed the regulation of reproductive tissues in the ART sector as part of the proposed Class 1 Framework for regulating solid organs and reproductive tissues (now the Biologicals Regulatory Framework).  This review recognised that the 'ART sector already has an effective, cross-jurisdictional system of regulatory oversight in place through the RTAC accreditation process'. At the Australian Health Ministers' Conference (AHMC) meeting on 22 July 2008, Health Ministers agreed that un-manipulated reproductive tissues should not be regulated by the Commonwealth through the Therapeutic Goods Administration under its proposed Class 1 Framework for human cellular and tissue therapies 'because the Assisted Reproductive Technology Sector is already coherently and consistently managed'. </span>

                <span class="HPS-Small">In view of the established compliance scheme and the review conducted in 2007, the Australian Government considers that a review of the current regulatory framework by the Australian Government is not warranted at this time. However, it is open to State and Territory Governments to provide a legislative framework that would ensure compliance with the NHMRC ART Guidelines, make provision for legal sanctions for ART service providers that failed to comply and offer greater certainty to individuals involved in ART procedures.</span>

It strongly recommends that clinics obtain their own legal advice. The NHMRC notes that 'reasonable expenses' for some parties may act as an inducement for other parties. The NHMRC considers that a 'one size fits all' approach may not be appropriate. The advice in the NHMRC ART Guidelines with respect to the reimbursement for reasonable out-of-pocket expenses in relation to the donation of gametes or embryos for ART procedures could be clarified in the next review of the NHMRC ART Guidelines (see Response to Recommendation 23).</span>

This year marked a major advance for Down syndrome—for people with Down syndrome and their families internationally—with the acceptance of it as an official UN day. Ms Penny Robertson OAM, who is the Chair of Trustees for Down Syndrome International, has responded to the motion which I sought the Senate to pass; and I was delighted to get unanimous support for that motion for Down Syndrome Day. Ms Robertson has responded: 'The role of Australian volunteer organisations supporting families of people with Down syndrome needs to be recognised and acknowledged as they have made a huge contribution to the level of acceptance by society, which has allowed many people with Down syndrome to live rich and fulfilling lives.' Ms Robertson goes on to quote the UN General-Secretary Ban Ki-moon, who, in a message that he gave to people in New York on World Down Syndrome Day on 21 March, said:</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Small">For too long, persons with Down syndrome, including children, have been left on the margins of society. In many countries, they continue to face stigma and discrimination as well as legal, attitudinal and environmental barriers that hinder their participation in their communities.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">People with Down syndrome in Australia have been relatively lucky compared to those in other countries, but not as lucky as they could be. The fact that we have now before us a national disability insurance scheme is one of the measures that is needed to improve our work with people with disabilities, including people with Down syndrome. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">As Ms Robertson points out, the role of Australian volunteer organisations supporting families needs to be recognised and acknowledged, as does the role of the families themselves and of people with Down syndrome. It is time we recognised that. Certainly a national disability insurance scheme will be a step forward in terms of recognising the needs of people with disability.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">But I cannot let pass the concerns that I currently have about the politicisation of the National Disability Insurance Scheme. There were articles not just in the Fairfax and Murdoch press in the past week but on most of the reputable internet comment sites as well, making the point that since Prime Minister Gillard apparently was having no effect by attacking Mr Tony Abbott, she had instead opted to try to wedge the Liberal premiers of Australia. The first item that she had chosen to use to attempt to wedge the Liberal premiers of Australia was the National Disability Insurance Scheme. That has proved ultimately to be a failure and yet comments that were coming through earlier after her grandstanding on the topic of the National Disability Insurance Scheme suggested that the Liberal premiers were being very easy to wedge on this.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">There is the hypocrisy of talking about let's not play politics with people with a disability, let's not have a partisan approach to this. I find it hypocritical and distasteful to seek to use COAG—whatever happened to stopping the blame game—as a political tool and to use the National Disability Insurance Scheme at COAG as a political tool. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">What I also want to comment on today—and I am sure it is a point that Ms Robertson would support—is the fact that a national disability insurance scheme over time will not be a cost to our economy. I first want to look at just a couple of statistics that we have. There is a disability employment summit coming up in November this year which makes the point that 45 per cent of people in Australia live in or near poverty and that improving their employment outcomes is a must. I note that Ms Penny Robertson is one of the speakers at this conference. I should point out that Ms Robertson, despite being the President of Down Syndrome International and chair of their board of trustees, is an Australian. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">There is another forum—WAVE or Women in Adult and Vocational Education. They are particularly asking: do TAFEs and registered training organisations deliver the goods for women with disabilities? The point is made that only 14.9 per cent of women with disabilities are in full-time employment, despite 25 per cent of men with disabilities being in full-time employment. You have to take in that underlying figure I mentioned before of 45 per cent of people with disabilities living on or near the poverty line. Women with disabilities are far more likely than men with disabilities to only have part-time work. Thirty-five per cent of women with disabilities have part-time work and 23 per cent of men with disabilities who are employed have part-time work. Yet there are more women with disabilities who have post year 10 qualifications, more with degrees and more undertaking training. This is certainly a very good question that one hopes will be partly answered by the improvements that we will see in service provision. Why are the outcomes so poor for people with disabilities in general, particularly for people with intellectual disabilities such as Down syndrome and for women with disabilities? These are questions that we must answer. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">NDIS reform is designed to dramatically increase the employment participation of people with disabilities and their carers. We in Australia currently have the 24th lowest employment rate of 29 countries measured by the Productivity Commission for people with disabilities. We are way behind countries such as the United Kingdom and Canada. We are well behind New Zealand in terms of the percentage of people with disabilities that we employ. If we could achieve the employment ratios of people with disabilities equivalent to the average OECD benchmark, the Productivity Commission estimates there would be an additional employment growth of 220,000 people or jobs by 2015 and that that alone would result in one per cent increase in GDP, translating to around $32 billion in additional GDP in that year alone. The Australian Network on Disability, which is Australia's employer group for disability employer organisations, recently put out a report estimating that a $43 billion increase in Australia's GDP would come if we could even reduce the disability employment participation gap by just one-third. They point out that reduction by one-third should be achievable. It is less than has been done by New Zealand and others.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Then there is the great advance of giving the opportunity to work to carers who currently cannot work because of caring for someone with a disability. If just 20 per cent of the 190,000 carers in Australia who are of workforce age but not working went to work in the community services sector—a low-paid sector—they would benefit the economy to the tune of $6.3 billion per year. If they were employed at a more average wage across major industry sectors, the economic impact would be around $32 billion a year.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I urge people to stop talking about $3 billion and $9 billion and the cost of an NDIS. Yes, there will be implementation and set-up costs along the way but the benefits to the Australian economy, to people with disabilities and people with Down syndrome in particular will be huge in the long term.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">I was interested to read the comments of Mr Jason Clare on the Bsafe program in his letter of 6 July. While it gave some information, it was certainly disappointing that, yet again, the federal government has knocked back the opportunity to look at ways to support this really excellent program.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">First off, it is worth sharing with the Senate what Bsafe actually means. It is a very innovative program initiated by the Women's Health Goulburn North East. There was some very modest federal government funding that came to that program. This program provides personal safety alarms to women and children at risk of domestic violence. Interestingly, many of the women involved in it have said that they find this a much more successful and less intrusive way of managing their problems than calling the 000 emergency number. So it has been widely praised by users, by community workers, by the police and by many of the women's groups, as well as Women's Health Goulburn North East. It is designed to assist women and children to feel safe in their own homes.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The program did receive some funding. It was a modest $230,420 in 2007 under the National Community Crime Prevention Program. Then after a lot of lobbying and a lot of work by the community, which was supported by the Greens—it was pleasing that the motion went through the Senate, but disappointing that Labor did not support it at that stage—a further $55,000 was brought forward. We are now hearing the government say that it is not possible to provide recurrent funding because the second lot of money comes under the Proceeds of Crime Act—that is, the $55,000 that I mentioned. Yes, I understand what the rules are there, that it cannot be recurrent funding, but this is such a cost-effective program. The government time and time again tells us of its deep commitment to addressing domestic violence, and here we have a means to ensure women are safe in their homes. It has been identified time and time again that when we are dealing with domestic violence we need to find ways to assist the victims of domestic violence—by far the majority of them women and children—to stay in their own homes. And here we have this program that the government has put a little bit of money into but has now turned its back on.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">It is very troubling when you look at the figures. These are just the figures from Victoria, which is where the Bsafe program had been funded. The Greens were hoping that Labor would have got behind it and it could have been rolled out across the country. But the figures show why that program is so very much needed. The research shows that intimate violence is a leading contributor to illness, disability and preventable death for Victorian women aged 15 to 44. My colleague Senator Richard Di Natale has spoken about this, detailing how this ranks higher than obesity, smoking and high blood pressure. Every way you look at it, this is a program that should have been funded. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Going back to the point that I made previously—that is, that I do understand that it does not fit within the rules—time and time again we see the government change the rules. Often we disagree with that, but they adapt to the situation. You have that ability, when you are in government, to identify what community needs are and how they can be funded.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I was concerned with one aspect of Mr Clare's letter, where he said Women's Health Goulburn North East did not apply for funding. I am in the process of checking up on that. I understand that is the case, that they did not apply for funding, because they were told they did not qualify. That shows the deceptive way that language can be used to misrepresent a situation. I am following that up at the moment because I think it would be very disappointing if those comments were made in that way, when in fact the organisation was given the money.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I want to commend Women's Health Goulburn North East and everybody else who has been involved in the Bsafe program. I know they are continuing to work on it to ensure that women and children can be safe in their own homes. The Greens will certainly continue to give their support so that it can be rolled out around the country. It has been shown to be successful and it is time the political will of the government of the day got behind it so that we could achieve that.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">This is a brief response from the minister to what ended up being a brief motion. A more extensive motion was moved in the Senate by my colleague Senator Joyce and me on 9 May this year; however, only one part of that motion was passed, and that part called on the government to ensure that the final Murray-Darling Basin Plan is based on the most up-to-date data and the best available science, consistent with the requirements of the Water Act 2007.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I welcome the response of the minister insofar as it addresses this. The minister's response restates the fact that the government's position has always been that the Basin Plan should have a sound scientific foundation and that the final plan should optimise environmental, social and economic consideration. The minister's response further highlights the requirements of the Water Act 2007 that the Murray-Darling Basin Authority and the Commonwealth water minister act on the basis of the best available scientific knowledge and socioeconomic analysis when developing the plan.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Insofar as the government has restated what we already knew, the response is indeed welcome. However, it is important to note that the motion, limited though it was, did have further intent behind it, which was to ensure that the final Basin Plan is based, firstly, on the most up-to-date data and, secondly, on the best available science, consistent with the requirements of the Water Act 2007. Here is where we run into, in many ways, the crisis of confidence that is afflicting the progress of the Basin Plan throughout the community, both upstream and downstream. Upstream communities have made clear their real concern that the data and the modelling undertaken by the Murray-Darling Basin Authority is not as up to date as it possibly could be and has not included the most recent wetter years within its modelling and data analysis. I do note that the MDBA has responded in other fora indicating that, were those recent wet years to be included, there would be a very small difference of negligible value. However, I do believe it is important that the most up-to-date data is applied to ensure that you try to harness and maximise confidence in this important reform process in those upstream communities. Similarly, there are concerns about the best available science and whether that is being used, and those concerns are particularly imminent in downstream communities.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Knowing what is the best available science is something that is often a matter of debate. 'Best available economics', 'best available science' and 'best available modelling' are terms that are sometimes thrown around rather loosely in this chamber and in politics generally. Indeed, there will be, as one would always expect, different scientific opinions as to the impact of different things. But it is important, it is vital, in order to try to reinstate confidence in this process that the MDBA and the government demonstrate that the science they are relying on for the modelling they are doing and for the proposed Basin Plan they are putting forward is science in which credible scientists have confidence. That is what I would ask them to do. I am not going to stand here and pick one scientific organisation and say, 'Their modelling is the best available in this,' which I know some state governments and some other stakeholders have done. But I am going to urge the MDBA and the government, as they seek to finalise this plan, to ensure that they demonstrate it is based on credible science and that it has credible scientific supporters behind it.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We are reaching the very pointy end of this process. It is five years since the Water Act was passed, and it has been a long, drawn out and tortuous process to get to what is almost a final Basin Plan. The Minister for Sustainability, Environment, Water, Population and Communities, Mr Burke, really is the only person now, barring some surprises from the MDBA, who can influence the outcome of this plan. It rests with him, and I would expect that he will finalise it over the coming weeks or month or two and that we will see it tabled in this parliament shortly.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Let me make it clear that I want to see it finalised, I want to see it tabled and I want to see it succeed. This is an important reform. It is vital for my home state. It is an issue on which I have probably spoken more in this place and in Senate estimates hearings than on any other issue at all. For that reason, can I say that the tactics of some involved in the progress of the Basin Plan are starting to concern me. The tactics of those who want to try to ramp up pressure around the place, on different parliamentarians, on government, opposition and crossbenchers alike to talk more about this and to judge us, as one organisation is proposing to do on what we do over the next two weeks, concerns me greatly. Many of us, and some in the chamber right now, have worked on this for many years. I have received an email from the Australian Conservation Foundation, who tell me that they propose to track parliamentary and other public communications of South Australian federal MPs and senators during the next two sitting weeks and that they will publish a report at the end of this period to see what it is that we have done and said about the Murray during that time.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Well they can track this comment: I think it is a childish game they are playing. I think there are too many stunts being played. Stunts by my hometown government, the South Australian state Labor government, stunts by interstate coalition governments, stunts by my hometown media, the Adelaide <span style="font-style:italic;">Advertiser</span><span style="font-style:italic;">, </span>stunts by some irrigator organisations and stunts by some environmental organisations. Frankly, anybody who looks at this rationally is going to know that it is impossible to present a Basin Plan that will make everybody happy. Any Basin Plan is of course going to require certain trade-offs. I make those statements not because I want to sell my home state out but because I want to see us take a good step forward. I want to see us take the best possible step forward in this basin plan to achieve a more sustainable management of the Murray-Darling Basin in the future. But I want to see us take a step forward not take no step at all.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I am concerned the approaches of some of the stakeholders throughout this process are putting us at such polar extremes in this debate that the risk will be we will get no Basin Plan whatsoever. If that is the case, if the final plan that is tabled is rejected by this parliament because it is not perfect in the eyes of some, that will be a devastating act, I believe, for my home state. Yes, of course, we should fight to get the best possible outcomes for our states. I believe that is what I have done in the five years that I have been here. I believe that is what I did when I first stood in this place—happily, on the other side of the chamber—to speak for the passage of the Water Bill, as it then was. It was the last great reform of the Howard government: to try to have a national plan in place for the management of the Murray-Darling Basin system, a national plan that did not rely upon state jurisdictions but could ensure the basin would be managed sustainably. It was a plan whereby $10 billion was budgeted to aid in the transition for its implementation and to ensure that it could be implemented in a manner most sympathetically to the irrigation communities throughout the Murray-Darling.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I have been and remain incredibly critical of many of the ways this government has gone about spending, or in some cases not spending, that $10 billion. I remain very concerned about many of the approaches the Murray-Darling Basin Authority has taken throughout the course of this. However, we are at the pointy end now. I want to see us get the best possible outcome. That is what I will fight for. But I do not need any community organisation to start tracking the number of times I—or, frankly, any other colleagues—say words in this place on a topic that is so important.</span>

                  <a href="I0U" type="MemberSpeech">
                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Senator HANSON-YOUNG</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">South Australia</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">17:24</span>):  I rise to speak on the same matter as my South Australian colleague Senator Birmingham. I think it is extremely disappointing that we are at this point of the review into the Murray-Darling Basin Plan—draft after draft—and yet we still do not have the accurate modelling that we need to allow parliamentarians and our constituents to understand exactly what it is that we are being asked to decide between. What is it that we are being asked to trade off and what is it that we are being asked to favour when we talk about the amounts of water to be returned to the river under the current plan, as put forward by the Murray-Darling Basin Authority?</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">For quite some time—in fact, since the guide to the draft plan—many people, not just in South Australia but across the rest of the country, politicians, environmentalists and irrigators alike, have asked for correct modelling on the different volumes of water to be returned to the Murray-Darling Basin. The best available science continues to tell us that a minimum of 4,000 gigalitres is what is needed to return the river to health—or to give it a fighting chance—into the future. Yet the Murray-Darling Basin Authority has refused to model the impacts of returning 4,000 gigalitres. They have absolutely refused to model the return of that amount of water and put on the table squarely for everybody to see what that would mean. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">They have also refused to model returning the figure that they had originally suggested, based on the best available science, was needed if we were to have a gold-clad guarantee that we would save the river system, and that would be in the vicinity of 7,600 gigalitres. We are being asked to sign off on a plan without being given all the information that should be available if parliament is going to lock in a plan that is meant to take us out to 2029, which is what this plan does. It nearly takes us to 2030 and yet there is nothing in the current draft plan that takes into consideration the impact of climate change. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The best available science tells us that there is a drying climate—that there is going to be less run-off, particularly in my home state in South Australia and other parts of the southern basin, where the climate is drying. Run-off is going to be lower. None of that modelling, none of that data, is being used in this plan, and there is no avenue for incorporating it into the management of the Murray-Darling Basin once this parliament signs off on the plan, which of course Minister Burke would like us to do before the end of the year.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I think it is a bit rich to expect South Australians in particular to cop locking in a plan that is currently delivering less than the best available science tells us that we need. What is currently on the table is 2,750 gigalitres but that is much less than what the best available science tells us is needed to flush those two million tonnes of salt out to sea, to keep the pollutants flushed out, to keep our river healthy, to ensure that we have quality water that can be drunk, used for feeding our stock and of course keeping the ecosystem healthy and well. The best available science tells us that we need 4,000 gigalitres and yet what is on the table is 2,750 gigalitres. The difference between 2,750 gigalitres and 4,000 gigalitres is the death of the Coorong and the death of South Australia's Lower Lakes. That is what South Australian parliamentarians, along with everybody else in this place and the other, are being asked to tick off on. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Yet this is a plan that is meant to be in line with the Water Act, which says, 'We know there has been overallocation throughout the basin for generations.' Some people have been far too greedy, taking more water than they can sustain, more water than they deserve—'Let the river run dry'—and are now squealing about the fact that we have to start putting some of that water back to keep the river healthy. Yet South Australians are being asked just to go, 'Okay, we'll take the bare minimum.' Well, no, we will not take the bare minimum. We will not lock in a system that is going to create failure for our system and that is going to condemn the Lower Lakes to a slow death and kill the Coorong, to leave our irrigators in South Australia high and dry when drought hits. This plan has a lack of modelling, a lack of data and a lack of a basis of having the best available science, resulting from ignoring Australia's top scientists when it comes to putting this plan together. This has meant that we are being asked to tick off a plan that is not a plan for drought. This is not a plan for the tough times and it is only going to help us in the good times.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We know that it is not actually that long ago that we were in drought in South Australia, which of course had been extremely exacerbated by overallocations and by a greedy 'take and then take as much as you can and hope no-one notices attitude', particularly by the big irrigators in the upstream states. South Australians remember how high and dry we were left by the rest of the country. Our communities remember, as it was not so long ago, the stories of the members of our elderly communities who were living in communities along the river and could not shower and even boil their kettle because the water that was coming out of the tap was polluted and salty. That was not that long ago, yet we are being asked to sign off on a plan that does not take the tough times into account and will not set us up to be resilient when we need to be resilient the most. When the chips are down, when there is less water in the river and when everybody is worried about the little amount of water that there is available, it is those of us who live at the bottom end of the river who suffer the most. I am not just saying that because it sounds nice to say, as a good sound bite. We know that because it has happened consistently over years and years and years—and it happened only five years ago in South Australia.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I am extremely disappointed that Minister Burke has not required the authority to do the appropriate modelling so we can have an honest and transparent discussion about what we are trading off if we do not go with what the scientists tell us we need. If we accept 2,750 gigalitres, tell us what that means we are going to lose. It will be the Coorong and the Lower Lakes. Tell us what that means for Adelaide's water quality when the dry time hits. Tell us why the plan will not be enabled to take into consideration the impacts of climate change when this is meant to be a plan for the future. There is no justification for this place or the other place accepting a plan to be handed to this parliament that does not tackle the issue that it is meant to, overallocation. If we do not start putting more water back into the river and if we do not tackle those big greedy irrigators from upstream, we are setting ourselves up for failure, we are selling out South Australia's beautiful Coorong and Lower Lakes and we are going to be condemning South Australian communities to drink salty water for years to come and saying goodbye to our irrigating communities in the Riverland in particular.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">At the moment this is a plan for failure. This is a plan that fails South Australia and because it is so inconsistent with the objectives of the act, to save the river system, it is destined to fail in the courts as well. I do note that the minister has also refused to put the government's legal advice on the table in the way that the Senate has asked. I think there is very little excuse for the minister to be refusing to do that. It is everybody's right in this place to know what this plan will do and what it will not do, who it will fail and who fails because of it.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">South Australia</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">17:34</span>):  There is no bigger issue in South Australia than the issue of water and water security and the health of the Murray-Darling Basin so I note the minister's very cute response to the Senate resolution. It would be laughable if this were not such a serious issue. We still have no real indication of how the authority has reached its 2,750 gigalitre a year figure. Further still, many of our leading scientists, including those of the Goyder Institute for Water Research, the CSIRO and the Wentworth Group of Concerned Scientists have suggested that this figure will not be sufficient to flush two million tonnes of salt—enough to fill the MCG—from the system every year. What did the Wentworth Group of Concerned Scientists say? They said:</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Small">Our fundamental objection is that none of the 2011 draft Basin Plan documents provide even the most basic information as to the volumes or timing of water that are required to give a reasonable prospect of achieving these objectives.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Take the CSIRO review, that by the Commonwealth scientists, if you like. They said that a 2,800 gigalitre per year reduction does 'not achieve the majority of the hydrological targets that have been set in the draft plan'. The Goyder institute has again reinforced those views that this is not good enough.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">As for what is at stake here, the motion of Senators Joyce and Birmingham that was truncated and passed was simply to ask for the scientific modelling. This is simply about transparency. This is about accountability on an issue that is of fundamental importance to the people and environment of South Australia. I am concerned that unless we get this right South Australia will be left in a terrible position, in terms of its communities that rely on the river, in terms of its agricultural production, in terms of the environmental assets of South Australia, particularly the Coorong and the Lower Lakes, and in terms of the health of the lower reaches of the river. We in South Australia are the vulnerable ones because we are the ones that cop it with salinity, with the toxins in the river system that need to be flushed out through the Lower Lakes, through the Coorong. Professor Mike Young, the eminent water scientist and economist, has said the Lower Lakes are effectively the lungs of the river system. And, as Professor Young has said on many occasions, great river systems die from the mouth up—so this is a great concern.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The minister is someone I have a great regard for, but his response in this case was completely and utterly inadequate. It concerns me that the Murray-Darling Basin Authority takes the glib view that things will be sorted out by the market; that somehow, amongst the more efficient irrigators, the market will sort out the 971 gigalitres that need to be clawed back under the plan from the southern reaches of the basin. The problem with that is this: South Australia has been done over. The Water Efficiency Fund of some $5.8 billion is skewed against the state, because South Australian irrigators have already done the hard yards in water efficiency measures many years ago. They had to after the 1968 drought. They had to begin to do things such as having closed pipes and more efficient water irrigation measures. So the ability to be more efficient, to have access to that fund, is limited. I think only $10 million or $20 million has gone to South Australia. It is a tiny, tiny fraction of the billions in the Water Efficiency Fund. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The irrigators and communities in those states that get the water efficiency funds—the lion's share will go to New South Wales and Victoria and some to Queensland—will get money to be more efficient and they will get to keep half the water and the other half will go to the environment. That is the deal, and I understand that. But the concern is that, if the Murray-Darling Basin Authority so glibly says, 'We will let the market sort this out,' the market will be skewed by virtue of that very fund—instituted by the Howard government, continued by the Rudd and Gillard governments—because those irrigators will have extra water to play with, extra water to put in extra crops, extra water to trade with, whereas South Australian irrigators will not have that benefit. From a market point of view, from a basic water economics point of view, that is a disaster for South Australian irrigators because it will mean entire regions will be wiped out. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">If we are going to get this right, if we are going to do this once and for all in a way that is in the national interest, that is in the interests of communities and in the interests of the environment, we need the information, we need the science and we need the modelling. I find it extraordinarily disappointing that the minister is not prepared, as I understand it, to order more modelling by the Murray-Darling Basin Authority to ensure that the 2,800 gigalitres per year reduction actually achieves the majority of hydrological targets, because the CSIRO review says it does not. Let's see that modelling. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I think it is very important that we get it right. What concerns me is that, with predictions of an El Nino weather pattern, things will be tough. We could have very dry conditions in the next year or two and the impact on South Australia will be devastating. I have spoken to so many irrigators in so many communities who had to sell their assets, who had to sell their water entitlements, who had to mortgage their homes in order to keep their permanent plantings—their citrus trees and other crops—alive. It is completely untenable that we are not given the basic information, the basic research and the fundamental modelling to make sure we get this right. That is why it is important that this totally inadequate response by the minister be noted. </span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">The Senate resolution that the Attorney-General has responded to relates to discrimination in the workplace as a result of domestic and family violence. I note that the Attorney-General's response states that a range of views were received, both for and against, including this ground of discrimination, and that these views are currently being considered. I certainly welcome the fact that this is still before the Attorney-General. I would like to make some comments on this matter, because many people are looking to the Attorney-General for leadership in this area and for a willingness to include domestic violence in the antidiscrimination laws. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The prevalence of family and domestic violence is much greater than most of us understand. I will shortly share some figures with the Senate. Every time I read those figures I am quite shocked at how extensive it is. There is a link to disrupted work and negative impact on career paths and income levels for the victims of domestic violence, who, in by far the majority of cases, are women. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The issue is a big one. The Greens argue that it is time for federal discrimination laws to catch up and to ensure that women in the workplace are not discriminated against because of the violence they face in the home. Current discrimination laws do not cover this problem, and that is why it has been raised by many organisations, both in the legal sphere and by community groups that work in the area of domestic violence and on women's issues. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Thousands of women suffer damage in two areas. For victims of domestic violence, there is the horror of that, and then they are so often discriminated against in the workplace because of possibly associated disability, illness and forced absenteeism. Some of the big problems are associated with the time factor—that they need to take time off to be able to access services and handle the criminal justice system. Again, this goes back to why we need that workplace flexibility and recognition.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">What antidiscrimination protection for victims of domestic violence would achieve has been described as providing the missing link in Australia's regulatory response to domestic violence. It has been well established in law, in services and in many of the debates on issues to do with priorities addressing women's discrimination that we need a national response on domestic and family violence. We know that that domestic response needs to include antidiscrimination protection. The suggestion for the adoption of antidiscrimination protection for domestic violence victims, as I said, comes from a range of organisations. Some of those organisations set it out quite clearly.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The Australian Law Reform Commission in 2011 was asked to examine whether federal laws could be reformed to better address domestic and family violence. Its final report released in February this year recommended numerous changes, including amendments to the Fair Work Act in respect of workplace regulation. The Law Reform Commission recommended that the Australian Human Rights Commission examine the possibility of protection for victims of family violence under antidiscrimination laws. The Human Rights Commission took up this proposal and made submissions for federal discrimination laws to be amended to include protection on this new ground for victims of family violence. Interestingly, the ALP national conference last year resolved to 'ensure that Fair Work and antidiscrimination frameworks provide appropriate protection to victims of domestic violence in the workplace'. So, many groups recognise that now is the time. As I said previously, this is the missing link in the national context of how we respond to the worrying trend of domestic violence.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The figures are deeply troubling. The most recent estimates show that family violence is the leading preventable cause of death, injury and illness for Australian women under 45 years of age. That comes from a Victorian health study in 2004. It remains pervasive across all Australian communities and costs our community around $423 million annually in lost productivity. That was an assessment by Access Economics. The Council of Australian Governments' national plan to reduce violence against women and children seeks to reduce the violence experienced by women and children to enhance the social and economic participation of victims. So, both the figures on the extent of domestic violence and the many organisations that have recognised the issue of domestic violence in the workplace and social participation of the victims of domestic violence underline why we are now at the point where we need to have that shift. The Greens will continue to work on this because we think it is time that the government considered introducing domestic and family violence as a separate ground of discrimination and considered making discrimination related to domestic and family violence unlawful in the workplace, extending this to not just the public sector but also private companies to include domestic violence clauses in enterprise agreements.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The evidence is there. It is another area where we need political will and leadership: addressing the missing link of legal protection by expanding the antidiscrimination laws provided to assist the victims of family and domestic violence.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Question agreed to.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I note that the current regulation was signed by the Governor-General on 10 May 2012. It was then tabled in the House of Representatives and the Senate on 21 May this year. The disallowance period of 15 days for the committee's review of the listing began from the date of the tabling. Therefore, the committee was required to report to the parliament by Thursday, 28 June 2012. This report was originally tabled in the House of Representatives on that date.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Hezbollah's External Security Organisation was initially listed in 2003 under legislative arrangements which required that, for an organisation to be listed, it had to be on the United Nations list of terrorist organisations. The ESO came up for review under the current prescription regime in 2005, 2007 and 2009. This review is the fourth relisting of the ESO as a terrorist organisation.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The committee would like to make it clear that this is not a listing of the entire Hezbollah organisation. However, looking at the ESO in particular, the committee was faced with a difficulty. Many of the resources that the committee uses to independently look at terrorist organisations that have been relisted, such as Jane’s Terrorism and Insurgency Centre—something that I know is very close to the heart of Senator Feeney, who, as I speak, is reading the words of that very organisation—and the United States National Counterterrorism Center, do not now differentiate between Hezbollah and Hezbollah ESO. In relation to the difficulty of attributing specific attacks to Hezbollah's ESO, the statement of reasons refers to the secretive nature of the ESO and the fact that:</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">… it is difficult to gather detailed information about the group’s role and activities. However, there is no indication that the ESO’s role has changed in recent times, and considering Hizballah’s stated desire to avenge the death of Imad Mughniyah, and the recent arrest of a probable Hizballah operative in Bangkok, it is likely that the ESO retains its separate terrorist function within Hizballah’s overall organisational structure.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The statement of reasons points out that the External Security Organisation is a discrete branch within Lebanese Hezbollah responsible for the planning, coordination and execution of terrorist attacks against Hezbollah's enemies outside of Lebanon.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The ESO was set up by Imad Mughniyah, who has been described variously as the head of Hezbollah's security section, a senior intelligence official and one of the founders of Hezbollah. After Imad Mughniyah fled to Iran following Hezbollah's 1983 attack on the US military in Beirut, the international wing grew out of the military wing to become a separate branch under Mughniyah's control. This is thought to be the genesis of Hezbollah's international wing, or the ESO. Globalsecurity.org states:</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">In Israel's view, Hizballah's activities are part of Iran's overall policy with regard to Israel, which is to fan the flames of the Israeli-Palestinian conflict and initiate terrorist activities against Israel, despite the fact that Hizballah is a Lebanese organization consisting entirely of terrorists from Lebanon, with no national connection to the Israeli-Palestinian conflict. In view of Iran's interest in smudging its fingerprints with regard to direct control over internal terrorist activities, Hizballah's status is significant as Iran's front-line operative arm against Israel.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Hezbollah elements provide training, operational support and materiel to Palestinian extremist groups, including to the Palestinian Islamic Jihad and Hamas's Izz ad-Din al-Qassam Brigades, both of which are prescribed entities, and also to Shiah militia elements in Iraq. Although these activities are undertaken by units within Hezbollah specifically created for these tasks, elements of the ESO are likely to be involved. It is clear that many of the research organisations, such as Jane’s Terrorism and Insurgency Centre and the United States National Counterterrorism Center, that the committee refers to in reviewing a relisting such as this no longer make a distinction between Hezbollah and Hezbollah ESO.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">On this basis, and with the benefit of having examined this organisation on numerous occasions, the committee was able to conclude that certain activities attributed to Hezbollah could equally be attributed to Hezbollah's ESO. The committee found that the Hezbollah ESO continues to engage in activities that satisfy division 102.1 of the Criminal Code, and the committee recommends that the regulation not be disallowed. I commend the report to the Senate.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Small">Today I introduce the Consumer Credit Legislation Amendment (Enhancements) Bill 2012. This Bill continues the Government’s commitment to ensuring that all Australians get a fair deal when they use credit.  </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">This Government has already introduced the most important national reforms in the history of Australian credit regulation.  We have introduced a national licensing scheme for lenders and brokers, responsible lending obligations that seek to prevent consumers entering into contracts where they cannot afford the repayments, and, new requirements in relation to the two most popular forms of credit, home loans and credit cards.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">This Bill maintains our commitment to ensuring that the balance of fairness is not lost, particularly for the most vulnerable of consumers.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">Since its introduction last year, the Enhancements Bill has been subject to reviews by the Parliamentary Joint Committee on Corporations and Financial Services, and by the Senate Economics Committee.  The Government has also conducted lengthy and detailed consultations with stakeholders. Arising from these consultations, the Government introduced amendments to the Bill which improve its effectiveness.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">The package of reforms introduced in this Bill address four main topics, relating to short-term lending, reverse mortgages, enhancements to the national credit legislation and closing the current regulatory gap in respect of consumer leases. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">I will address each of these in turn.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">

                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">It is estimated that at least $500 million is lent annually in short term, small amount loans. At one end it can include small loans in which a person borrows $300 which must be repaid plus interest a week or two later, on the borrower’s next payday. It also covers larger loans up to $2000.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">The vast majority of these loans are provided to low-paid workers or people on Centrelink benefits. It is estimated that nearly half of payday borrowers have incomes of less than $24,000 a year, and up to two-thirds earn less than $36,000.  It is not acceptable to this Government that such consumers are left to fend for themselves.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">Australians who use payday loans are usually unable to access other cheaper forms of credit. As a result they face two risks.  </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">The first is the risk of excessively high costs, as consumers who can’t shop around can end up paying whatever the lender decides to charge. For example, there have been cases of lenders charging $1477 in interest and fees on a loan of $1000 for 26 weeks, or $2074 on a loan of $1000 for 52 weeks.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">The second is the risk of a debt spiral, where an existing loan is extended or rolled over into a new loan. The consumer is then faced with using even more of their income to meet repayments, reducing their ability to meet other expenses from their own income. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">Borrowing for the basics might seem like it helps in the short-term, but for many people it simply makes things worse. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">Borrowing high-cost money leaves the underlying financial difficulties unresolved. When the direct debit payment comes out automatically at the next pay-day, it can leave the borrower with no cash for the next week’s basics, so they go get another loan, trapping them into a cycle of debt.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">Most borrowers take out multiple loans and there is evidence that some lenders’ existing business models actually rely on this occurring. They need people to come back again and again, borrowing more and more, and paying bigger and bigger fees.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">Take the example of a person on a fortnightly Centrelink benefit. They are caught short one week and take out a $300 loan, filling in a direct-debit form with the paperwork for the day their next payment hits their account. Typical fees on that loan will be at least $105, if not higher. So on their next payday $405 comes out of their account, leaving them short the next week as well. So they take out another loan – and the spiral of debt begins.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">The responsible role of Government is to facilitate a competitive  market, and to intervene when the market fails. Here there is a market failure: the price of borrowing money is too high.  Borrowers who are desperate for cash will pay whatever it costs to get a loan quickly, whatever the consequences might be the next week.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">What’s more, Australian payday lenders’ fees have grown substantially in the last decade and are now among some of the highest in the world. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">In America, some states have adopted caps of between 16% and 35%. In Canada, rates are capped as low as 17% in some provinces.  Interest rate caps apply in 14 European Union nations: France, Germany, Italy, Netherlands, Poland, Portugal, Slovakia, Spain, Slovenia, Greece, Ireland, Malta, Belgium, and Estonia.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">So we are now implementing Australia's first national cap on costs for 'small amount' contracts - that is, contracts for $2,000 or less that run for less than one year.  After extensive consultations with the small amount credit industry and consumer advocates since the introduction of the Bill, the level of the cap has been doubled so that lenders will be limited to charging an upfront fee of 20 per cent of the amount of credit the borrower receives, and then four per cent each month for the life of the loan.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">The Government is satisfied that the new level of the cap on costs for these contracts will result in an ongoing viable small amount lending industry, but one in which exploitative or inefficient lenders will need to change their business models.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">This cap delivers real outcomes for consumers.  It ensures that borrowers who are in need of a small amount loan will not face relatively high costs, and will reduce the risk of an ongoing cycle of dependency through the continued use of this form of credit.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">But providing for a cap on costs is only part of the protections under this package.  The Bill addresses the risk of a debt spiral by introducing specific responsible lending obligations. These obligations replace prohibitions which were initially included in the Bill such as on a lender refinancing a small amount credit contract. They provide a more targeted and effective response by seeking to improve lending standards; whereas a prohibition may only encourage avoidance.   </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">The responsible lending obligations will include a presumption that a small amount credit contract will be unsuitable where it would be the borrower’s third such loan in the last 3 months. This is an important change as repeated use of this type of credit within such a short period of time would be a likely indicator that the borrower is in financial hardship, and that a further loan would therefore not be suitable. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">The implementation of this obligation as a presumption allows lenders to provide further credit where they can demonstrate facts that displace the presumption. This gives lenders additional flexibility relative to a prohibition. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">Also, we think more could be done to encourage consumers to utilise other cheaper options.  There are currently cheaper alternatives to small amount loans, such as Centrelink advances, utility hardship programs, and no-interest and low-interest microfinance schemes.  Under these reforms small amount lenders will be required to disclose the availability of these options to their customers.  </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">It is also proposed that small amount lenders who operate websites will be required to provide a link to the ASIC financial literacy website at moneysmart.com.au.  </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">Given the likely impact of these reforms the Government has amended the Bill to introduce a requirement for a review of the operation of the cap after it has been in force for 2 years. This will enable the effect of the reforms to be considered, including matters such as the level of the cap and whether there is a need to address avoidance techniques that may be developed in response to the caps.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">These measures will tackle the problem of long term debt dependence, and ensure that borrowers are aware of alternatives that may better meet their needs.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">There is no doubt that over the course of the Government’s consultations regarding these reforms, strong views have been expressed on both sides, from lenders and consumer groups.  The effects of payday lending on the welfare of Australian households have been strongly debated.  But this Government thinks it’s time that the interests of consumers come first. </span>

                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">

                  </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">The Bill also introduces new protections for seniors seeking to take out a reverse mortgage.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">Many senior Australians have worked hard to own their own home before retirement. If they now need to access the equity in their home through a reverse mortgage then they deserve to be adequately protected.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">This class of borrowers are particularly vulnerable for a number of reasons. First, they are unlikely to be able to recover financially if they enter into the wrong loan and exhaust their equity.  Secondly, reverse mortgages are very different from other credit products and most borrowers will not be familiar with how they work.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">The most significant risk to seniors is that they may end up with a debt greater than the value of their home, known as ‘negative equity’.  That is why the Government is implementing Australia's first statutory protection against negative equity.  This will ensure that older Australians are not caught short at a time in their life when financial stability is so important.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">The other major risk is that consumers will make poor choices because they are unaware of, or do not appreciate, all the consequences of entering into a reverse mortgage. For example, they may borrow too much while still relatively young and unknowingly restrict their future choices if they later need to move into aged care accommodation.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">Reverse mortgage lenders and brokers will therefore be required to meet specific disclosure requirements. They will need to show consumers different examples ofhow the equity in the home will reduce according to how much they borrow, and according to different movements in house prices and interest rates.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">I am pleased to say this approach is supported by industry and will result in consumers making better choices in balancing their current and future needs.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">

                  <span class="HPS-Small">The Bill also introduces several important enhancements to the national consumer credit law.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">Firstly, there are changes to reduce the risk that borrowers in genuine hardship will face enforcement action by lenders, including losing their homes.  The Government considers it important that borrowers should have the best possible chance to come to an arrangement with the lender that avoids court action.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">The procedures in relation to hardship variations will therefore be more flexible. And the restriction that means borrowers cannot apply for a variation because they borrowed more than $500,000 will be removed. </span>

                  <span class="HPS-Small">Since the introduction of the Bill, the Government has also taken into account the concerns of industry by introducing a requirement on consumers to provide information to their credit provider or licensee in regard to a hardship variation request.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Small">Secondly, providers of credit services such as brokers will be made more accountable by introducing a remedy for conduct that is unfair or dishonest.  Unfortunately there will always be some brokers who exploit the consumer’s trust in them for their own benefit – this remedy will require them to adopt high levels of conduct, consistent with the standard of fairness, or face action by consumers.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Small">Thirdly, the Bill will restrict the use of the following words or phrases: “independent”, “financial counsellor” and “reverse mortgage”. These types of terms have an emotional or high impact resonance and have been used in ways which mislead or manipulate consumers.  These words and phrases will now only be used where they strictly describe or relate to particular types of conduct or arrangements. </span>

                  <span class="HPS-Small">This Bill also provides for regulatory balance between credit contracts and consumer leases.  Currently, the National Credit Code imposes significantly different obligations according to whether or not the consumer has a right or obligation to purchase the hired goods at the end of a consumer lease.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">The experience of over a decade with the old State and Territory Uniform Consumer Credit Code was that the technical nature of this distinction has resulted in regulatory arbitrage.  Some providers elected to offer consumer leases because of the lower regulatory requirements, and not necessarily because the consumer does not want to own the goods at the end of the contract. This particularly affects low income consumers who may not have other finance options; they can end up paying for the use of goods such as fridges or computers without ever being able to own them. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">Under the Bill, consumer leases will be largely regulated consistently with credit contracts, to reduce the incentives for providers to use leases in a way that can disadvantage consumers.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Small">The Gillard Government is ensuring that fairness remains a feature of Australia’s credit markets.   In particular, we are ensuring that the regulation of credit does not happen in a way that ignores the vulnerable – such as some seniors or those on low incomes or people who find themselves in financial hardship.</span>

With MySuper not due to commence until 1 July 2013, the government has ample time to engage in meaningful consultation with industry if it wants to introduce a more practical test that would not have potential negative consequences for members of affected superannuation funds.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The coalition, as I mentioned in my speech in the second reading debate, has serious concerns about the new scale test provided for in this bill which requires trustees of superannuation funds to 'determine on an annual basis that there is sufficient scale in terms of assets and beneficiaries such as to not disadvantage the financial interests of beneficiaries relative to the financial interests of beneficiaries in MySuper products in other registrable superannuation entities'. Industry experts, such as those of the Financial Services Council, have provided evidence that such external comparison would be impossible to conduct in practice as a trustee will not have sufficient knowledge of other registrable superannuation entities in order to realistically make judgments on this and meet this test.</span>

                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The scale test is based on a presumption that larger funds invariably provide lower fees and higher returns to members. There is no evidence to indicate that this presumption is correct in all cases. In fact, a number of smaller funds very assertively argue the case—and have the evidence to make this case—that they consistently deliver higher net returns than some of the larger funds. The scale test, if implemented in its proposed form, could be another potential source of advantage to the larger industry superannuation funds because they have existing scale. The scale test would create a significant new barrier to entry for new funds by making it difficult for them to achieve the required scale from the outset, which would lead to a reduction in competition in superannuation—which is of course not in the public interest. A cynical mind would come to the conclusion that this may well be the express intention of the government—that is, to provide yet another competitive advantage to their friends in the union dominated industry super funds movement. It may also lead to further consolidation and mergers of super funds that are driven not by any assessment of the overall best interests of the members but by concerns about meeting this technical and very arbitrary test. Industry groups have submitted that a better alternative would be an internal test based on a finite list of factors rather than the open-ended and poorly defined external test that the government has proposed.</span>

                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">It should be noted—and I drew attention to this in my remarks in the second reading debate—that the Cooper review into Australia's superannuation system, which was commissioned by this government, did recommend that MySuper products should have a scale test; but the scale test recommended by the Cooper review was quite different from the scale test in this legislation, which quite inappropriately seeks to provide yet another advantage to larger industry super funds. I draw the attention of the Senate to the recommendation in the Cooper review which says that trustees should 'actively examine and conclude whether, on an annual basis, its MySuper product has sufficient scale on its own, with respect to both assets and number of members, to continue providing optimal benefits to members.' That is recommendation 1.6 on page 25 of the final report of the Cooper review. This recommendation, with the use of the term 'sufficient scale on its own', clearly implies an internal test rather than the open-ended and poorly defined external test that the government is proposing in this legislation.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The government, and all senators across the chamber, should support this amendment so that this particular provision is deleted from the bill. If the Senate were to support this amendment the coalition would be in a position to support the legislation as a whole. This bill, in the way that it is drafted at present, is yet another example of a minister for superannuation who is deeply conflicted in this policy area. He is invariably focused on pursuing the vested interests of one segment of the financial services market at the expense of others instead of pursuing regulatory reforms that are competitively neutral and in the public interest. With those few words, I commend the amendment to the Senate.</span>

                    </a>  We reject that. This bill, and this particular part of the legislation, is not about 'bigger is always better'. There is no dollar value that creates an impediment to new superannuation funds. The bill does not impose a minimum size on a fund and nor does it force smaller funds into mergers. In fact, in recent times it has almost gone the other way, and some of the big funds have not merged. There is almost a push to maintain the current number of funds. This legislation requires that MySuper trustees on an annual basis specifically focus on whether there is any lack of scale that is disadvantaging their members. They do not have to be a particular size, they do not have to have a particular amount of money, but they just have to pose the question. Having been a trustee of a super fund for 15 years, I do not think that this is an unreasonable requirement. I certainly would not see this as an impediment to the continuation of the fund that I was a trustee of, and I would not see it as an impediment to any new fund entering the field. </span>

                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">It is not intended that trustees will be required to make detailed comparisons of their performance against every other fund in the market, and it is expected that many well-performing funds will also be able to readily determine that their members are not being disadvantaged due to insufficient scale. Contrary to the implication in Senator Cormann's amendment, this legislation clearly allows for small, well-performing funds for which scale is not a barrier to performance to continue serving their members as they have always done. I personally have been a supporter of those small funds—if you like, 'boutique funds'—which provide good superannuation entitlements to their members. I think that is a good way to work. I do not think this legislation does what Senator Cormann says it does, and the government does not support the amendment.</span>

                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">
                    <a href="e5d" type="MemberSpeech">
                      <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Senator JOYCE</span>
                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Queensland</span>—<span class="HPS-MinisterialTitles">Leader of The Nationals in the Senate</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">18:29</span>):  I rise to speak on the Aviation Transport Security Amendment (Screening) Bill 2012. This is yet another example of a positive agenda where the coalition and the government can come to an agreement on something that is definitely to the benefit of the Australian nation, especially in areas relying on security. This bill will introduce body scanning technology to provide additional security at our international airports. I have just got back from the United States and this was standard fare at every airport as you went through. There is nothing too startling about it: you go into a box, you put your arms up, they scan your body and off you go.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Three legislative changes have come in response to the much publicised breach of aviation security in Detroit on Christmas Day 2009 which drastically focused attention on how the world must consider aviation security, including here in Australia. On that day a passenger of Northwest Airlines flight 253 attempted to detonate an improvised device as the flight descended to Detroit airport. The man had successfully concealed the device in his underwear through the screening in both Amsterdam and Yemen: the metal detectors he had walked through had not picked up the non-metallic explosives he was carrying. Since that event three years ago, body scanning technology has been introduced in the United States of America, Canada, the United Kingdom and the Netherlands. A component of the cost was dedicated to trials last year. The new technology was tested over a period of three weeks at Sydney and Melbourne airports, with 23,577 scans undertaken.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Under this bill, if a person is randomly chosen for a body scan there is no chance to opt out for an alternative screening procedure. If the person refuses a scan they will be unable to pass through the screening point, they will not be able to board their flight or enter an area of security control at an airport. As a result, this bill will repeal section 95A, the opt-out rule, which currently allows for the choice of a frisk search over another screening procedure. Mr Deputy President, while in the United States I went both through the scanning booth and was frisked, and I tell you right now I would prefer the scanning booth—the frisking is quite an experience. Interestingly, the United Kingdom also has a no-opt-out policy and, of the 1.5 million scans conducted, there have only been 12 occasions of passengers refusing to undergo a scan.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The greatest concern about this bill is the potential for body scanning technology to invade personal privacy. I can understand that completely, but the bill includes protection on this issue. First, any image produced by a body scanner must be gender neutral. Also, the person cannot be identified and no physical elements of that person can be revealed. The scans are made based on energy reflected by a passenger's body or any object inside clothing. The unit's software technology compares images with standard profiles and then superimposes the anomalies on a generic human image that is displayed for analysis by screening staff. In addition, the technology that the government specifies does not have the capacity to store or transmit information or data. The scanner has a short electromagnetic scanning field of less than two seconds. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The wave scans are within the limits set by the Australian Radiation Protection and Nuclear Safety Agency. The assessment by the US Transport Security Administration confirms that the technology emits 10,000 times less radiofrequency energy than the average mobile phone call. The exposure is also much lower than passengers experience routinely during a flight. Outside a scanner, the exposure for aviation security screeners is very small. Importantly, the scanner can detect both metallic and non-metallic items such as those which caused the 2009 Detroit security breach and made us all think much more deeply about the wider threats to airline security. Unlike walk-through metal detectors, the low power level of the body scanner technology means it will not detect internal medical devices such as pacemakers. I am advised there are no known safety concerns in relation to people with these devices undergoing these types of scans.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">In other words, the scanner can detect items that are either difficult or impossible to detect by alternative means. The only alternative method to achieve the same outcome would be an extensive frisk search, which is one that officially would not meet Australian community standards. On this note of detection, it is worth reflecting on the results of the trials undertaken last year. The trials showed few had difficulty with the process but there was, however, a higher alarm rate than that for the walk-through metal detectors caused by money, hair clips, watches and the like.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The coalition will support these measures as it generally has done on aviation security measures in the past, such as those that emerged from the Wheeler review of aviation security which was completed by the former coalition government in 2005. The coalition in government had a strong record of securing Australia's borders by strengthening aviation security. Following the terrorist attacks on September 11, 2001, the coalition redesigned Australia's aviation security regulations to match the greater risk posed by the barbaric terrorism that had been unleashed by mediaeval religious fundamentalists. We substantially upgraded the quarantine service, more than doubling it in one budget alone. We also increased inspections at airports and made sure that almost 100 per cent of passengers coming into Australia went through a proper customs and quarantine check.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">That record stands in stark contrast to the record of this government. Last year the government let tuberculosis clinics close in the Torres Strait due to a lack of funds. This is despite the government's chief adviser on infectious lung disease, Julian Waring, warning that closing these centres had Australia being exposed to a more virulent form of tuberculosis, including the drug resistant XDR-TB strain.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Last year the <span style="font-style:italic;">Australian</span> reported on this almost negligent lack of foresight. According to their reports, a young, desperately ill girl from PNG, Papua New Guinea, was brought to one of the previously operating clinics on the Torres Strait Islands. The four-year-old girl weighed only nine kilograms and was unconscious, suffering from cerebral TB. She had been receiving ineffectual treatment for several months in PNG's Western Province. As a last resort, her mother brought her to the Australian clinic, but it was too late. After she was transported to Cairns, a scan confirmed that she was brain dead. Graham Simpson, a Cairns based respiratory specialist, had to tell the girl's mother to take her daughter home to die. He said that had she been presented to the clinics that we used to have operating in the Torres Strait Islands before the Labor Party closed them down, she would have had a fighting chance. According to a colleague of Dr Simpson's, it only takes one case of XDR-TB to get into the Torres Straits to be a public health disaster. By the time that patient was picked up she may have infected 15 to 20 other people. It should be noted that the capacity and the prevalence of this disease has spread especially around people who are lying out, long-grass people, those in the Indigenous community of the north. The total cost of running the Torres Strait clinics is—or was—$22 million a year. Previously the Queensland government had contributed $18 million and the federal government $4 million. The clinics have closed because the Gillard government refuses to increase its contribution. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The introduction of body scanning technology is estimated to cost $29 million. This would seem to be a reasonable investment of money for the extra security that it will deliver, and the coalition will not oppose these measures. The coalition will support measures which will provide benefits greater than their costs. It will support bills that come into this place after detailed consideration and review. What the coalition does not support is excessive uncosted and wasteful examples of government spending. This government has given us many examples of public extravagance—the school halls, the NBN. </span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">On the NBN, it is worth reflecting on the update of the figures that were announced last weekend in the updated NBN Co. 2012-2015 corporate plan. As expected, the corporate plan reveals the NBN, which is the next budget nightmare, is taking longer and costing us more to roll out than the government claimed when it initiated the project. It is also attracting fewer customers and earning less revenue. Labor still claim that the NBN will be finished by 2021, but every deadline so far has been missed. In 2007 they were claiming that the NBN would require a total of $4.7 billion—</span>

                    <span class="HPS-MemberContinuation">
                    </span>Thank you very much, Mr Deputy President. I was pointing out the costs that we have for this measure. It is pertinent to understand comparative costs and where the government has its priorities. The overall cost of the NBN, when we take up operating costs and lease costs and capital costs, will be over $60 billion. They seem to be able to find money for a telephone company but they cannot find money to stop tuberculosis coming into the northern part of Australia or to prevent the deaths tuberculosis causes. They cannot find money for that but they can find money for another telephone company, which at this point in time looks like going bad before it has even grown.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">What we have seen is that prudent expenditure on such things as these protection mechanisms is extremely important because it maintains the safety of the travelling public. We have had an example of this technology placed outside the members' dining room. I rarely go there; in fact I do not think that I have ever been into the members' dining room without a guest in the time that I have been in this parliament, except maybe twice. One of these body scanning operations was placed outside there for everybody to go and have a look at and to be part of. It gave an example of how this was to be tested.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I also note that since the time of the introduction of this form of technology, we have not, fortunately, had any separate occurrences of people causing any problems after they have been through it. Nothing is ever going to get us completely in front of the terrorists and their desire to take us back to a form of life that would be appropriate for the Middle Ages, but anything that can keep us travelling safely is to be supported.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">In closing, while the whole thing stitches together and expenditure such as this keeps people safe and is all about saving people's lives as they travel on international flights, we should also look at it as an example in a comparative analysis of the way this government has completely lost its priorities. Apparently protecting people's lives in the northern part of our nation by maintaining vital TB clinics in the face of growing risk is a less important priority. We know that in the southern parts of Papua New Guinea there is a high prevalence of TB, yet a government that can apparently find $60 billion in funding all up for a telephone company cannot find the money to maintain a tuberculosis clinic in the Torres Straits. This manifestly expresses the loss of priorities in a government that is confused and out of its depth, a government that does not know what it is doing, a government whose representatives are not really at the wheel. They have basically lost sight of the issues that are important or lack the muscle or the push to try to drive agendas to make sure that we protect people of the Torres Straits from tuberculosis. Unfortunately we lack people with a capacity inside the political sphere to be able to drive these agendas, and people suffer as a result. So I commend this bill to the Senate and note the coalition's support. I also note that there will be amendments coming up and I will approach them as they come.</span>

                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">New South Wales</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">18:44</span>):  This bill paves the way for compulsory full-body scanners to be introduced in major Australian airports. It could also pave the way for longer queues at our airports because the responsible minister, Mr Albanese, has failed to address many of the problems with the technology and he has failed to work with groups which could have helped sort out the serious problems that many other countries have recognised with this technology. The Greens are ready to support antiterrorism measures such as full-body screening where the government demonstrate that the risk warrants such technology, where they demonstrate that the technology actually works and achieves the stated aims and where the proper health and privacy safeguards are in place.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The bill as it is before us does not meet any of those requirements. I will be moving amendments when we go into the committee stages, and those amendments are largely based on recommendations that came from the Senate inquiry into this legislation. It was my colleague Senator Scott Ludlam who referred this bill to an inquiry when he was the Greens transport spokesperson, particularly because of the health and privacy concerns that have been widely identified. He reiterated concerns raised at the time when the bill was first proposed. That was clearly needed because these full-body scanners are enormously invasive. He also questioned how effective the technology actually would be and whether this technology would have a measurable impact on security at our airports.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I do thank Senator Ludlam for his work in this area, because if he had not taken it to that inquiry very valuable information that was presented in submissions from a number of organisations would not have come before the Senate. However, the inquiry was rushed. Again, the government seemed to see this as something that just had to happen, rather than approach it in a serious and comprehensive way—to actually take advice, and take that advice on board. In the end there were about 16 submissions, and many of those submissions did address issues to do with privacy and health concerns. Civil Liberties Australia, as well as civil liberty organisations in New South Wales and Queensland, put in submissions. The Office of the Australian Information Commissioner also provided some useful information, and I particularly found the Australian Airline Pilots' Association submission very informative. But all up there were only 16 submissions, and I think that was because it all had to be done so quickly, with only two weeks to get a response in.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">First off, I would just like to share with the senators some of the issues to do with full-body scanners. The Italian government actually did bring them in for a period of time, but after a six-month trial they dropped the use of full-body scanners for security checks in airports because they identified that they were too slow and ineffective. That is why I go back to the point that I made in my opening remarks, that we already know about the delays at airports, and if the technology is used in its current form that is when we could well be thinking of the legislation that the minister, Mr Albanese, has chosen to rush through, and that he did not choose to tighten it up. The delays that we already experience could blow out even further when we consider what the overseas experience has shown.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The president of Italy's aviation authority actually conceded that the trial did not deliver good results, as the scanners took a long time to examine a person—in fact, more than a manual inspection. Also, the experience in Germany was interesting. There, the trial was conducted at the Hamburg airport. In this case it was police who criticised the machines, saying that they triggered an alarm unnecessarily in seven out of 10 cases. The machines reportedly were confused by layers of clothing and zippers, and this experience has also been found in Australia. But just sticking with the experience in Germany, they found that in 10 per cent of cases it was actually the posture of a passenger which set off the equipment incorrectly.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Those scanners which I just referred to were produced by the same manufacturer as will be used in the Australian trial.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Tasmania</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">18:50</span>):  I rise to speak to the Senate tonight about iron. Much is said about the mining of iron ore in Australia. Iron and steel play an enormous part in our lives every day. And we know that there is iron in every single cell in our bodies. We know that there is iron in our food, and we know that fresh meat is a good, healthy source of iron. But some people in Australia are pumping too much iron.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">David Blackmore is a fifth generation farmer. He has been a pioneer of the production of 100 per cent full blood wagyu beef in Australia for more than 20 years. He produces premium beef that is sought after in Japan and North America as well as by Australia's most celebrated restaurants. Some years ago David was flying the world, making many overseas trips to sell his product. He knew about jetlag. But he did not understand why he began to feel tired all the time. He was suffering chronic fatigue and his body ached in nearly all his joints. He came to discover that he had haemochromatosis.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I have spoken about haemochromatosis once before in this place but, just to reiterate, I want to explain to people what haemochromatosis is. Haemochromatosis is also known as inherited iron overload disorder and is the most common hereditary condition in Australia. One in every 200 Australians of European origin has the genetic predisposition for haemochromatosis. Most people know that if you have too little iron in your body, the condition known as anaemia, then you can feel weak and lethargic. But it is much less well known that too much iron often causes the same initial symptoms. People with haemochromatosis absorb too much iron from their food. The overload builds up gradually and silently over the first four or five decades of life. Iron is deposited in the liver, the heart muscle, the pancreas and various other organs. In the early years of adulthood the extra iron may give extra strength and more fight and endurance. That may be why this Viking mutation survived and prospered. It gave added strength for pillage and whatever else they may have got up to. But as the overload increases it becomes toxic.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">For those with haemochromatosis, the first symptoms are often fatigue and joint pain. For David Blackmore, these were the symptoms that alerted him that there was something wrong. Fortunately his diagnosis came before too much permanent damage was done to his body. At higher levels the symptoms include arthritis, diabetes, liver cirrhosis and cardiac arrhythmia, and there is a much-increased risk of liver cancer. The incidence of breast and bowel cancer is doubled and the need for joint replacement is greatly increased. Having spent a lifetime studying bloodlines, David quickly understood the hereditary nature of the condition and made sure that all his family were tested.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The good news is that haemochromatosis is not only easy to diagnose but also very easy to treat. The uncontested and universally accepted treatment is venesection, or giving blood, just like donating blood to the blood bank. When blood is removed the body replaces it and, in doing so, draws iron out of its stores. By giving blood regularly, iron overload is reduced. David gave blood once a week for 18 months to get his iron levels back to normal. There is even more good news: the blood given by people with haemochromatosis is usually acceptable to the Australian Red Cross Blood Service.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">The bad news is that this condition is seriously under-diagnosed. It is not well known in the general community and is often overlooked in medical services. If this widespread condition were treated by a sophisticated and expensive pharmaceutical product, its existence would have been promoted widely. With a potential market of over 100,000 Australians at genetic risk, the profit motive would ensure that as many people as possible were diagnosed and treated as early as possible—and early diagnosis is essential. If diagnosed early, this condition is entirely treatable and it is no impediment to a healthy and successful life.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">There is, as yet, no formal assessment of the cost of haemochromatosis to this nation through work time lost or of the amount of medical treatment required as a result of the poor rate of diagnosis and treatment of this condition. There are numerous reports of chronic fatigue leading to time away from the workplace and early retirement. Patients often give a history of years of distressing symptoms, greatly affecting quality of life, before a diagnosis is made. Unfortunately, late diagnosis can be fatal. Liver cancer can sometimes be alleviated by liver transplants , but both the costs and the risks are high.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">In the absence of a profit driven response it has been left to a non-profit group to raise awareness and to provide support to people affected. Haemochromatosis Australia is an entirely voluntary organisation that has been supporting people with the condition for over 22 years. This year, for the first time, it is staging a Haemochromatosis Awareness Week from 13 to 19 August. Recently I sent information to all senators and members promoting this event on behalf of Haemochromatosis Australia. Funded by the subscriptions and donations of its 1,500 members, this organisation has arranged public meetings, displays and exhibitions in all state capitals and several regional centres. It has organised a poster and media campaign.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Last Friday night I had the pleasure of officially opening the <span style="font-style:italic;">Overload</span> exhibition that is currently being held in Tasmania, in one of the northern suburbs of Hobart, at Cooleys Hotel. The exhibition includes artwork by Andrew Christian, Georgina Richmond, Pat Avent, Helen Jessup, Diana Gifford, Caroline Amos, Belinda Casey, Sarah Weaver and Simone Zell. The artists have kindly agreed to donate 20 per cent of any sales from the exhibition to Haemochromatosis Australia so that the organisation can continue its important work. I would like to take this opportunity to congratulate all the artists and everyone else involved for putting together such a fantastic exhibition. I would especially like to mention Sarah Weaver. Sarah had an idea some years ago about doing an art exhibition for Haemochromatosis Australia, and she pulled it together this year. As I said, it was held at Cooleys Hotel, and I would also like to thank Cooleys Hotel for donating the space for the exhibition.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The message for Haemochromatosis Awareness Week is: 'Are you feeling tired and flat with aching joints over a long time? You may have haemochromatosis, inherited iron overload disorder. It's much more common than you think. Talk to your GP about your symptoms and haemochromatosis.' In addition, this group has published and distributed, at its own expense but with the help of its very eminent medical advisers, an excellent booklet, <span style="font-style:italic;">Haemochromatosis: Your Questions Answered</span>.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">In conclusion tonight, I would like to state quite clearly that haemochromatosis is a condition whose time has come. We know that it does a great deal of unnecessary harm and imposes a significant cost on the nation. The name, as the posters and pamphlets state, may be difficult to say but it is very easy to find and very simple to treat. I would encourage everybody both in this chamber and in the other chamber to read more about haemochromatosis. You can visit the Haemochromatosis Australia website, www.haemochromatosis.org.au, or call their information line on 1300019028. As I said, this organisation has been voluntarily run for 22 years. A fairly well-known Tasmanian, Mr Ben Marris, is the national president of Haemochromatosis Australia. At the time that I was opening the art display last Friday night, Ben was in Parramatta, officially launching the official national Haemochromatosis Awareness Week. It is a great cause for people to be getting behind, supporting and helping to raise awareness of. I know that at least one person in this chamber suffers from haemochromatosis, because they have spoken to me about it. For anyone else that is suffering any of those debilitating symptoms, raising awareness and helping people know what the cause might be can help save a life.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">

                  <a href="DYU" type="MemberSpeech">
                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Senator FAWCETT</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">South Australia</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">19:00</span>):  I rise tonight to talk about the cuts to the Defence budget, particularly the remarks from the minister in response to people who have had their lives involved with Defence—people such as the previous Chief of Army, Professor Leahy, who is now Director of the National Security Institute of the University of Canberra and who has commented that the minister just does not get it and is missing the point when he says that the cuts will not impact on Australia's national security. The minister replied with the fact that funding to operational troops has been quarantined, corralled so people in the theatre will have all that they need. But he misses the point that people in the theatre are one part of the Defence organisation.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The Secretary of Defense in the United States, Mr Leon Panetta, as he is facing the massive cuts the American military is having to make, gave a warning that Australia should heed. He gave a warning about the danger of hollowing out the force—what happened after Vietnam and what has happened to many militaries after a time of conflict, when people expect a peace dividend, the ability to wind down their capability. Mr Panetta identified that if you keep your force at the same size and reduce the amount of funding then something has to give, in particular given that we are operating in an environment where over the last number of years funding has been cut year after year and we have seen a number of efficiency programs. Defence is not some organisation with layers and layers of fat that can be milked to get more savings; this is already an organisation that is running in a fairly lean manner.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I would like to take one particular area to highlight the fallacy of the view that you can quarantine funding for people who are deployed but cut elsewhere with no impact. This goes to the issue of reserves. If we look at the reserve forces we see that on 30 June this year the current Chief of Army, General David Morrison, was addressing Australian Reserve Forces Day and he talked about the fact that the ADF has engaged in uninterrupted operations since 1999. He was making comments about the high tempo. He said specifically:</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Small">We could not have sustained this demanding tempo without the contribution of the Defence Reserves.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Many people tend to think of the Defence Reserves as being Tuesday night parade and perhaps some people who parade on the occasional weekend and do training, but the role of the reserves has changed significantly, particularly under Plan Beersheba, where the Army is looking to reshape the structure of its forces and the close integration of reserves. I note that the Air Force and Navy are also using their reserves in a far more integrated manner. It means that, when people are deployed, often the folk who backfill to keep things running here in Australia are reservists, whether they be on part-time duty or continuous, full-time service—for example, selection courses.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">People who go off in one of the most actively engaged group that Australia has at the moment are the Special Air Service Regiment, who have frequent deployments. But while they are deployed what is occurring behind the scenes is that people still need to actually run through the cadre course—the selection course—and the training programs. To date, much of that activity is done by the reservists. The benefit that gives people who are deployed is that when they come back they get time to do their promotion courses, to have some leave, to have some time with their families and to do some other training for themselves as opposed to having to fill a number of these functions. So, very simply, reducing the budget and taking away the training days for reservists does have a direct consequence for the ability of the military not only to deploy but to sustain a deployment overseas, because you need forces that are rested, re-worked up and able to be rotated back into theatre.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Those cuts behind the scenes, even to things like equipment, do have an influence. People deployed overseas rely on equipment. At the moment, the organisation within Defence that looks after procurement of equipment is the Defence Materiel Organisation. In estimates in February this year I asked some questions of both the CDF and the CEO of the DMO about the role of reservists, and it is illuminating to see that in DMO, for example, there are a large number of reservists—some 351 individual reservists—who work within the DMO to make sure that there is a military presence on acquisition projects. So, if days are cut and funding is cut to the behind-the-scenes operations, which include DMO, which include operations officers in RAAF units and which include communications specialists—and many reservists also provide services in areas such as medical, legal, dental and other critical services that the ADF requires—saying that you are quarantining funding for troops in the front line and that it will not affect the Defence Force is a fallacy. That is why many commentators are taking issue with the comments that the minister has made. General Morrison highlights that, of the 30,000-strong regular Army, there are some 17,000 reservists involved in supporting them. So cutting the funds is going to have an impact, particularly when you consider that cutting the funds now is on the back of the cuts that caused so much controversy at the end of 2009 and 2010.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The whole Plan Beersheba assumes that there is going to be a significant increase in the operational focus of the reserves, which is going to be affected through the development of the habitual relationships between reserve brigades and the regular multirole manoeuvre brigades. Just this last week I had the pleasure of attending the 9th Brigade welcome home parade for soldiers of 10/27 Battalion who had been serving in the Solomon Islands. It is a good example of where the reserves pick up tasks that would otherwise have to be fulfilled by regular forces. And so, again, cutting funding and cutting training days means that the aspirations of things like Plan Beersheba, the ability of the government to have a regional influence and still sustain our forces, will be cut. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Ultimately, the service chiefs are responsible for the raise, train and sustain function of making sure that their personnel are ready to deploy in accordance with the readiness notice that the government requires. The outcome of budget cuts such as that of the most recent budget, whereby we are mothballing a squadron of tanks and a squadron of armoured personnel carriers, reducing flying hours and delaying the purchase of combat gear, is that they have a flow-on effect. You cannot just make a cut and then keep your forces at the same size and keep the same operational tempo overseas without causing stress and strain in the organisation. That is what is known as 'hollowing out the force'. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">There are even effects on things such as submarine maintenance. Many people like to talk about how poor the availability of Collins class submarines is, when in actual fact they generally meet world standards of having two out of a fleet of six, given that the others are undergoing maintenance. But it is not going to make the Navy's job any easier with ASC now not maintaining submarines because of the lack of funding. There is a submarine out of the water, waiting for maintenance, but it looks like there will be a delay of months before work on it can actually start because there is no money coming from Defence to pay for the maintenance. So the flow-on effects that come from these cuts are damaging national security. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Despite the promises of this government back in 2009, which were backed up again by the new minister, that we would have Force 2030 and a real growth in funding, we have seen cuts that take us back to levels that we have not seen since 1938. So, whilst I applaud the fact that funding is being provided to people who are in theatre, I echo the concerns of many Australians who have long experience in the national security space that the sustained cuts over a number of years are hollowing out the force and we run the danger of having a Defence Force in years to come that does not have the depth or the capacity to fulfil the tasks that the government requires of it. </span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">South Australia</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">19:10</span>):  I rise tonight to speak on an issue which is of huge significance, and that is the supermarket duopoly strangling Australian grocery market competition and the impact of that on consumers. It is interesting to note that Senator Kim Carr is in the chamber. His comments a number of months ago about the duopoly and their impact on food processors were very welcome. They were strong comments, they were sensible comments and they were comments that I think triggered an increased debate about the supermarket duopoly. Those comments by Senator Carr were very welcome. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Just yesterday Master Grocers Australia, which represents independent supermarket operators across the country, released a report titled <span style="font-style:italic;">Let's have fair competition: the risk of losing retail diversity, choice and true competition in the</span><span style="font-style:italic;"> Australian supermarket industry</span><span style="font-style:italic;">.</span><span style="font-style:italic;"></span>Its findings were grim but, sadly, not surprising. For years I have listened to the stories of people who say that they are feeling the effects of the Coles and Woolworths supermarket duopoly in this country, not just in the grocery market but also in the petrol, liquor and hardware markets. These are all industries into which the tentacles of Coles and Woolworths have spread. I also think that these are issues which relate to the food processing sector. An inquiry chaired by our colleague Senator Richard Colbeck into food processing is due to report shortly. These issues were in the terms of reference of the inquiry and they were closely looked at.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Independent supermarket operators feel the effects of what they say is an unfair playing field. They are up against huge stores that offer big discounts both on the shelves and through schemes like shopper dockets. Superficially, that may seem like a good thing for consumers, but if the effect of that is to squeeze out competition and to force independents out of marketplaces then consumers are left with less choice, less diversity and, ultimately, with less competition and that can lead to prices being forced up. The big players have enough backing that they can carry any losses associated with schemes like these. Smaller operators simply cannot compete on an unfair playing field like this. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">These sorts of stories are backed up by the Master Grocers Australia industry report. Master Grocers Australia's President, Rod Allen, outlined the findings. They included a pattern of behaviour where the big players develop large supermarkets in small local markets—an example is Bright in Victoria. Anyone who saw <span style="font-style:italic;">Lateline </span>last night on ABC1 would have seen the impact that that had on a relatively small community's population of 2,000 people. There was one big supermarket, one of the big two, and it really crowded out competition; it put the squeeze on those small operators. The impact of that on the community is significant. There is also the issue of store saturation, anticompetitive price discrimination, shopper docket schemes and cross-subsidisation, where, in effect, you might be getting your petrol a bit cheaper but you end up paying more for grocery items. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">It is time for the ACCC to act in relation to these matters. I do congratulate Rod Sims, the relatively new chairman of the ACCC, on the way in which he has looked at these issues, because a number of people have come forward with complaints. I suggest that they are very much the tip of the iceberg. To give you an idea that the several dozen complaints that the ACCC received, as I understand it, is the tip of the iceberg, a few months ago ABC <span style="font-style:italic;">Lateline </span>ran a story about the food processing sector and the power of Coles and Woolworths, with their 80 per cent of that market dominating the sector. Apparently <span style="font-style:italic;">Lateline</span>'s producers made well over 100 calls in order to get someone to appear before a camera, to speak out about the practices that food processors were concerned about—practices perpetrated by Coles and Woolworths. Not one person came forward. Apparently, one person was willing to speak out but then they changed their mind at the last minute, as I understand it. So these are important issues.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I support the recommendation of the <span style="font-style:italic;">Let's have fair competition!</span> report for the ACCC to ban Coles and Woolworths using shopper docket schemes. I also support the recommendation made by Masters Grocers Australia to 'ensure the ACCC has the legislative power to require prior notification by the major chains of any proposed acquisition of a site, lease or existing business'. I agree with Master Grocers Australia's Chief Executive Officer, Jos de Bruin, who says Master Grocers Australia wants 'a fair go for the smaller independents'. The South Australian Deputy Small Business Commissioner, Associate Professor Frank Zumbo from the University of New South Wales, shares these concerns. Professor Zumbo is well known to those on the Senate Economics Legislation Committee for his tireless advocacy for competition in the sector, for consumers and for small businesses in this country. This report highlights many of the concerns that Professor Zumbo has raised over many year—that there is evidence of anticompetitive behaviour in the supermarket industry. In fact, Professor Zumbo was the author of Senator Joyce's amendment, the so-called 'Birdsville amendment', that was moved and passed in 2007, but we have yet to see any prosecution launched in relation to predatory pricing. That concerns me because it seemed to me to be a robust amendment that added to the body of protections in competition and consumer law of this country.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">Let's put in perspective just how big Coles and Woolworths are. A 2008 inquiry into the competitiveness of retail prices for standard groceries found that Coles and Woolworths accounted for 70 per cent of packaged grocery sales in Australia and about 50 per cent of fresh produce sales, including meat, fruit and vegetables. My understanding is that has increased and the overall benchmark is closer now to 80 per cent. These big two own 87 per cent of all Australian supermarkets with floor space of 2,000 square metres or more. That is simply unprecedented. There is no other country in the world where just two large grocery retailers have that amount of market power. Compare this with the United States. The two biggest supermarkets in the United States accounted for something like 20 per cent of sales in 2007. In the United Kingdom in 2011, the four largest supermarkets accounted for 75 per cent of sales. It is fair to say that enough is enough. It is time to act.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">I believe we need to go further. I believe that the courts in this country ought to have the power to require the divestiture of a company that has been found to abuse its market power, because right now that power of divestiture does not even exist in our competition and consumer law. If it is tethered to an abuse of market power, I think that is an appropriate thing to do. It will keep those companies that have a huge market share on their toes to ensure that they are behaving appropriately in the marketplace, in a way that serves the best interests of consumers, and the best interests of consumers are served by robust competition, by having a marketplace that is open and by allowing the smaller, independent operators to be able to compete robustly.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The comments made by Minister Kim Carr a number of months ago were very welcome. I think it is important that they are heeded by all sides of politics because, unless we act on the sensible recommendations made by Master Grocers Australia, we will find a situation where more and more small businesses hit the wall and will not be able to compete, and the long-term consequence of that is that there will be less competition and higher prices for Australian consumers. Enough is enough. We need to act. The Master Grocers Australia report is a good first step.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">
                  <a href="182468" type="MemberSpeech">
                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Senator THISTLETHWAITE</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">New South Wales</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">19:19</span>):  I have been fortunate to be involved in community volunteering for most of my life. When I was 13 years old I joined the Maroubra Surf Lifesaving Club and I remain an active member of the surf lifesaving movement to this day. Later, I became involved with the Eastern Suburbs Police and Community Youth Club in the area in which I worked.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The volunteer spirit is something that reflects the character of our nation, but while the number of volunteers in Australia has risen in recent years the number of hours that they commit to volunteering is actually falling. The median number of hours spent volunteering has decreased from 74 hours per volunteer per year in 1995 to 56 hours per volunteer per year in 2006. The result is that the actual number of hours Australians volunteer over time has been falling. This trend is in some respects understandable. As people find themselves working longer hours and with less time to spend with family and friends, the appeal of community involvement is diminished and its benefits are lost.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Volunteering also faces the challenge of staying relevant in a rapidly changing landscape. Many young people these days would prefer to spend time on the internet, Facebook, Twitter and other social networking sites rather than volunteering in their local community. This is one of the reasons that the Gillard government created the National Volunteering Strategy. This strategy sets out the government's vision for volunteering in Australia over the next decade. The aim of the strategy is to ensure that by 2021 volunteering is encouraged, supported and recognised by all Australians. Social, economic and technological change have transformed the way that we communicate and work and, as a result, the way that we volunteer. As new forms of volunteering emerge, volunteers continue to seek more flexible arrangements and shorter term commitments. We as a society need to be able to respond to those challenges in providing volunteering opportunities in the community.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">In response to these challenges, the government is committed to promoting greater engagement of young people in volunteering while also ensuring advancements in technology are utilised fully by not-for-profit organisations. In this respect, the government will allocate $12.4 million under the Digital Enterprise program to help not-for-profit organisations in targeting communities to understand how to maximise opportunities enabled by the National Broadband Network.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Volunteering is a positive pursuit for all involved. It has the power to enrich and turn lives around. I recently volunteered at the Hope Street Back Shed Cafe in Woolloomooloo in Sydney. This is a not-for-profit cafe that is connected with the Matthew Talbot Hostel in Sydney. It does great work bringing together the homeless, service providers and volunteers in that local community. It is a hub for people to come together and access services, and to provide hope—hence the name of the organisation.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">It is for reasons such as these—the positivity of community work and volunteering—that I have launched a campaign on my website called 'Give volunteering a go'. I have transformed some aspects of my website into a one-stop shop for those seeking a community group or organisation for whom they would like to volunteer. It is a good feeling knowing that you are putting people in touch with community organisations and supporting the work that they do in the community. I have had a good response. In recent months, particularly during National Volunteer Week, I was out and about, volunteering across New South Wales with various community organisations. I visited the Coffs Harbour PCYC to help out with their school holiday circus school. I volunteered at the Hunter Region Botanic Gardens. I spent time in a mock prison to raise money for Campbelltown PCYC. I have worked serving coffees at the Back Shed Cafe for the homeless in Sydney's Woolloomooloo. I have been encouraging other community minded people to do the same. I believe that we should be doing all that we can to promote volunteering and encourage younger Australians to take up volunteering for the potential personal growth and learning that comes as a result of active community participation.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Every day, local organisations bring together and develop that sense of what community is really about. It is only through an involvement with other people's lives that you truly understand and gain an appreciation of the pressures experienced by those who face issues such as intergenerational poverty, mental illness and discrimination. We have a responsibility as community members to ensure that those who are most in need receive support and are not forgotten by society.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The Labor Party's connection with community organisations is a cornerstone of the working class values that our party was built on: hard work, fairness and community activism. It was one of the issues that attracted me to the Labor Party. That connection has taught us a lot, not just as a party but as people. The potential to learn from the experience of community activism is limitless. I have always said that the best management course I ever did was being in charge of 15 or 16 lifesavers at Maroubra Beach when the surf was quite big—quite a challenge for anyone. It is through my involvement with the management of surf-lifesaving clubs and PCYCs that I was inspired to enter into politics.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Some of this work leads to safer, more prosperous communities. PCYCs, for instance, work with kids who have come from broken homes or tough financial circumstances to keep them from going off the rails and help them get back on track if they do. Police youth case managers work at-risk youths, who often have an average of three offences before joining a PCYC program. These programs involve managing issues such as school attendance, peer group choice, employment options and identifying interests and activities to support new directions in the life of the young person. For the young people who participate in these programs, the rate of reoffending is dramatically reduced, demonstrating the value of volunteering and these programs. I am pleased to say that this year the PCYC movement celebrated the 75th anniversary of its founding and the establishment of that first PCYC in Woolloomooloo, which was originally formed as an avenue for kids on the street to come together and practice their boxing after school.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The benefits of volunteering are significant for our nation, for our local communities and for individuals. The benefits are economic, social, cultural and environmental. I am particularly proud of the support the Gillard government provides to volunteer organisations and volunteers across Australia. In fact, right at the moment organisations can apply for volunteer grants for this year to help with the provision of equipment, fuel costs, training courses and compulsory background screening checks.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Volunteers are the foundation of the not-for-profit sector in Australia. Of the estimated 600,000 not-for-profit organisations in Australia, only 60,000 have paid staff. Volunteers contribute more than 700 million hours of unpaid work each year to their communities. The value of that unpaid work in 2006-07 was estimated to be over $14.6 billion. Volunteering strengthens community connectedness and social cohesion. Social connections such as those developed through volunteering can provide meaning, purpose and satisfaction in a person's life.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I consider myself very fortunate to have been involved in community activism. It has shown me the way to contribute to the community in which I live. Volunteering for my community not only helped those less fortunate or those who needed a helping hand but helped me personally. I am forever grateful for the lessons I learnt in my early life, and I hope that through this campaign in New South Wales I can show others firsthand the value of pitching in and giving volunteering a go.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">
                  <a href="241710" type="MemberSpeech">
                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Senator SMITH</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Western Australia</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">19:29</span>):  I would like to speak this evening about an issue of critical importance for those living in Western Australia's Great Southern region, centred around the town of Albany. It is no secret that those living in regional areas face challenges that are not always well understood by those living in our cities. Some of these challenges are the result of nature, such as droughts and bushfires, and some are the result of changing demographics, such as an ageing population. Others, I am afraid to say, are the result of bad government policy—the carbon tax being the most recent example of bad policy foisted by this government on the people of the Great Southern region, who will see their cost of living rise even more when the tax is applied to road transport in a couple of years.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The often-discussed tyranny of distance is another challenge facing those living in regional communities, and that is the one I am going to focus on this evening. Serious illnesses do not discriminate between those who live in urban areas and those who live in regional areas; however, the level of treatment available and access to that treatment often do. Of course, state-of-the art treatment and equipment tend to arrive first in our cities. That is where the bulk of the population reside and it is where many of the specialists who operate the equipment are based. However, it may surprise many senators to hear about the extent of the gap that exists between urban areas and regional communities.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">For instance, magnetic resonance imaging machines are probably taken for granted by many medical professionals and patients in city areas. MRI has a number of distinct advantages over the diagnostic methods, particularly CT scans. MRI provides significantly better diagnostic accuracy in certain areas than CT scanning. This is particularly the case in relation to breast cancer, brain and spinal cord problems, bone and joint issues and, most notably, the diagnosis of brain tumours. Importantly, MRI poses no risk from radiation exposure, whereas CT scans do carry such a risk. This is particularly the case when patients require repeat scans, which can lead to a build-up of radiation and increase a person's risk of developing cancers in the future. From this brief overview alone, it is clear that MRI is a desirable diagnostic tool; yet, unfortunately, it is not a tool that is available locally to those living in Western Australia's Great Southern region.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Since taking my seat in this place I have spent a good deal of time travelling around the communities that make up this special part of Western Australia. In the course of those travels I have been fortunate to meet with several medical practitioners operating across the Great Southern region. In regional areas doctors are significant community figures who are often called upon to go above and beyond the call of duty in meeting the needs of their patients and dealing with challenges that their city counterparts would not ordinarily face. In the course of my conversations with local doctors, most of them have made clear the desperate need for an MRI machine in Albany to service that town and the surrounding parts of the Great Southern region.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">At present, those living in the region who require an MRI scan need to travel to Perth. Perth is a five-hour drive from Albany—or an expensive flight. Many of the patients are elderly and, self-evidently, not in the best of health. If patients are making the drive, it is certainly too much to do as a day trip. So, in addition to fuel costs, there is the cost of at least one night's accommodation in Perth—not to mention time away from family and employment. It all starts to add up very quickly. I am not talking about a few isolated cases when I speak about those who are undertaking this travel. Doctors have told me that they send anywhere from seven to 20 patients per week to Perth for MRI scans. David Ingram, a general surgeon at Albany Regional Hospital, told me that many local patients are ordered to have CT scans even though MRI would be a better health option for them. He also advised me that many patients have a CT scan locally but end up having to travel to Perth to get MRI scan because the CT scan has not yielded the necessary information. This results in a double cost to the federal government.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Dr Anthony King, who practises in the small town of Kojonup, contacted me to express his support for an MRI machine located in Albany. He said in his letter:</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Small">As a GP, we can order an MRI scan for any patient. But the patient will not obtain a Medicare refund of the cost or part of the cost of the procedure. As GPs, we are forced to first refer the patient to a specialist who can then endorse/order an MRI scan, which will then attract a benefit payable under the Medicare Act. This system is completely stupid and costly in a region where there are very few specialists and where solo rural GPs are in effect doing a lot of the things specialists would do in a city environment.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Dr Kirsten Auret, of the Rural Clinical School of Western Australia, advises:</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Small">Within our Cancer and Palliative Care Services, there have been innumerable times when we have needed to send patients to Perth for MRI scanning. The requirement to transfer them away, when they are very sick and potentially in their last few weeks of life, makes clinical decision-making for doctors, patients and families extremely difficult.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Numerous other doctors in the region have contacted me to express similar views. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Improvements in health care across the Great Southern region are coming. The Liberal-led state government of Premier Colin Barnett is delivering real health outcomes for those living in the Great Southern region. The biggest is the construction of the $135 million Albany Health Campus, which will replace the former Albany Regional Hospital. The new hospital will establish the Albany Health Campus as a regional resource centre for the Great Southern region and will service more than 50,000 local residents. It will be the largest hospital development ever undertaken in regional Western Australia, and the Liberal-National government is committed to delivering the new building as soon as possible.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">With this investment in a new hospital, more than 80 per cent of patients from the Great Southern region will be able to be treated in Albany, closer to where they live. The new facility will include a new, much larger emergency department, additional mental health beds and expanded renal dialysis, palliative care and cancer services. As part of this new development, Great Southern Radiology has applied to Minister Plibersek for full Medicare eligibility for MRI based on potential areas of need. I would say to the minister that the Liberal-led WA state government has clearly done its part and it is time for the federal government to come to the party and provide this critical service for the Great Southern region.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">It would be a shame indeed if this magnificent new facility were not able to offer the best diagnostic and treatment opportunities available to its patients as a result of the minister not meeting Great Southern Radiology's request. I wish to place on record my very strong support for the application put forward by Great Southern Radiology, and I urge the minister to consider the needs of medical practitioners, patients and their families in the Great Southern region in coming to her decision.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">
                  <a href="I07" type="MemberSpeech">
                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Senator LUDLAM</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Western Australia</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">19:38</span>):  I rise to add some comments about a similar part of the world but further south from where Senator Smith has just been speaking of. This is an issue I know that our Acting Deputy President has quite close to her heart, which is the city of Geraldton. We both attended an event at the CUSP centre in Fremantle a few weeks ago for the launch of a document produced by the community of Geraldton that caught me by surprise somewhat, I suppose—not really knowing what to expect. It is titled <span style="font-style:italic;">Geraldton—from local to global regional city</span>. It is an extraordinarily visionary document, which came out of a series of deliberative workshops that were held by Janette Hartz Karp, who some senators in this place might be familiar with, whose speciality really is democratic decision making around what kind of communities we want to live in. Rather than top-down democracy, this is bottom-up deliberative democracy, and it works exceptionally well if it is given a chance.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">They have given this a try in Geraldton, and one of the outcomes is this document, <span style="font-style:italic;">Geraldton—from local to global regional city</span>, which is based around the concept of how they want this city to look in the year 2029—which would be 400 years since the Dutch were bumping into the coast. Interestingly, it will also be 200 years since the establishment of the Swan River colony further to the south. It has been put into gorgeous visual language by David Galloway and Sarah Andrews.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">At the launch we heard from Mayor Ian Carpenter, who deserves congratulations for his leadership in this project, and their quite dynamic CEO, Tony Brun. They have come up with a quite ambitious vision for Geraldton's future. For the information of senators not from Western Australia, Geraldton is a city about 430 kilometres to the north of Perth, in the mid-west region. Historically, the economy up there has been based on agricultural and the pastoral industry. There is a lot of interest at the moment in iron ore deposits not too far from the city of Geraldton. The community does not want to just be a quarry, so they are interested in the expansion of their town and they are interested in its development but they do not want it to be left, as some other Western Australian communities have, as a fly in, fly out centre with services hollowed out, with housing completely unaffordable and with the economy dangerously imbalanced. So they have taken the initiative and produced this document. I was at the launch. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I congratulate Minister Simon Crean for being at the launch and for giving the community a boost—which I think takes this document to the next level. It has come from the community but it has been endorsed by the federal government and also, I think, by the state government. The Leader of the Nationals in Western Australia has also made a contribution to this document.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">They are looking for an economically adaptive city—changing and diversifying the economic base with initial opportunities obviously still coming from agriculture, fisheries and mining—and to become a regional logistics and freight hub. They will be the first regional centre to have every household connected to the National Broadband Network. Even if there is a change of government next year and the opposition decide to simply flatten the proposal, Geraldton at least will get through the net. The coalition would then probably have some difficulties explaining to neighbouring communities why they do not get the system, but Geraldton will be through. They are also looking to the Square Kilometre Array project—which will offer completely different kinds of economic opportunities to the region—and being selected as one of 33 cities worldwide to receive an IBM Smarter Cities Challenge, which really takes local aspirations and gives them something of a global boost.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">They are proposing to be a carbon neutral city, and they are not just fiddling around at the edges. As was explained to us, this is a region that has all of the major renewable energy resources—with the exception of hydro—including wind, solar, geothermal power, biomass power and an amazing wave resource. They are not sitting on their hands; they are proposing to make this the world's first carbon neutral heavy industry city. As the mining industry expands—as most people believe it will—they are proposing to take not just the increased demand on the grid but also the existing demand and put large-scale solar plants in there. There is already a 10-megawatt solar farm going in, which will be the largest in the state if not in the country. They are also looking to roll out with local developers and other commercial interests renewable energy technology across all the portfolios to make this a renewable city.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">It is an extraordinary effort that they are making. As a Greens MP, it was quite something to come to the launch and realise that this is a community initiative. This is not something that we have been banging on about; it is rising from the community itself. I hope that the local member, Barry Haase, who was also present at an event that I spoke at that night, will convince his leader not to pull the plug out from under this community if he gets the chance. If there is a change of government next year not only will they be ripping the NBN out of regional communities that thought they would be getting it; but all the work that has been done on the clean energy legislation and on creating the resources to enable the kind of vision that is coming forward from the City of Greater Geraldton to become a reality will evaporate, it will disappear—and we will not let that happen. We want to help Geraldton realise this vision that has been put forward and endorsed by the town's leaders and brought to state and national prominence.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Another reason for my trip to Geraldton and to hear firsthand from some of the people who have put these proposals together was an invitation by Andrew Outhwaite and Kate Najar from Pollinators Incorporated, which is an extremely innovative and quite rapidly growing group of social entrepreneurs based in Geraldton. They are helping catalyse some of the really interesting things that are going on up there. It is Australia's only member based organisation dedicated to supporting social entrepreneurs. It provides a structure for its members to cooperate and access the support needed to realise their dreams, their projects and their aspirations for their community. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">It operates Australia's first regional social enterprise co-working and innovation space called City Hive on the new marina waterfront at Geraldton. They had organised quite an engaging public event, which I was fortunate enough to attend, titled Mythbusting Politics and People Power, which is where I was also able to hear the member for Durack speak. It attracted a full house on a Friday night. We had an extremely lively and interesting discussion about how, in their view, our political system is broken, how it is not providing for what people want. It was not a whinging session—quite the reverse. There were a lot of propositions put forward about how people in the local community and in regional cities like Geraldton could use their representation in this place, in some senses, to simply get out of the way and let them do what it is that they are trying to do.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I mentioned our fellow panellist Professor Janette Hartz Karp, who works globally but probably is best known locally in Western Australia for the Dialogue with the City process that she ran with the former planning and infrastructure minister Alana McTiernan. It took on a larger scale, with the City of Perth, people's feedback across a range of viewpoints and ran a deliberative process that came out with a planning policy that was quite visionary for the time it was put forward. We are still getting some of the benefits of that. She gives some teeth to one of the Greens' four pillars, that of participatory democracy, around the concept that democracy is not just a piece of paper that you put in a box once every three or four years; it is about taking these issues into your own hands. In some cases, we in this place and in state assemblies around the country are seen as the block and not the enabler, and that needs to change. I congratulate the Pollinators group for their vision, their reach into the community and the projects that they are running, including an event that I was able to speak at the following morning—the Catalyst project—at which I was very fortunate to meet a number of local leaders.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">My first stop in Geraldton was to launch the Bike Blackspot iPhone application, which I might have spoken of before in this chamber but I would encourage all senators with an iPhone, wherever you live, because this application is national now, to go to www.bikeblackspot.org and help our planning minister Albanese, because I know that cycling is a passion of his. We have not yet been able to get a national cycling fund off the ground. Senators will be able, either from the web or from a smartphone, to photograph your bike black spot, which is taken to a Google map and then sends an email and your photograph, and your note about the lack of cycling infrastructure—or something that you think is good—to a website. Geraldton is the first regional city where we launched that application. I was pleased to make that contribution because this is a community that cares a great deal about public transport, regional rail infrastructure and, of course, cycling. It is a perfect place for it. It is a city that is flat and has great weather. So I look forward to working more with some of the community leaders in Geraldton in helping them to support the amazing example that they are setting for the rest of the country.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Tasmania</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">19:48</span>):  Homelessness is everyone's responsibility. It has been a major agenda item for Labor since we came to government in 2007. To one day 'end homelessness' we need to be working together: government, the not-for-profit sector like Youth and Family Focus, business and, importantly, everyone as members of the community. The first place we must start is with awareness. The theme of National Homeless Persons Week this year was 'homing in on the real issues of homelessness'.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Devonport based Youth and Family Focus organised the HELP film festival—HELP standing for homeless and everyday life perspective. The HELP film festival tasked young Tasmanians with making a short film about homelessness from their perspective. Last week, on the first day of National Homeless Persons Week, the 17 films were screened at the C-Max Cinemas in Devonport. The students used their creativity to highlight many of the issues that homeless people face, issues ranging over domestic violence and family violence, relationship breakdown, substance abuse, mental illness, financial hardship and youth unemployment and disengagement.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Wynyard High School won the competition with their emotional interview with a former homeless man, Sebastian, and Anglicare housing officer John. I applaud these students for their courage in approaching Anglicare for the interview. They asked the hard questions of Sebastian and John and got some very honest answers. The film uncovered some of the real issues of homelessness in Tasmania, particularly around public housing processes and policies. At the screening I was fortunate to have some time to speak to Sebastian, John and Sebastian's friend Gary. Sebastian told me he had been homeless for 20 years. Recently he was fortunate enough to find a 'home' in Burnie. I asked him how that felt to now have a roof over his head and somewhere to call home. He hesitated, then went on to tell me that it was good, but he was still getting used to it. He told me that after sleeping rough for 20 years he had become accustomed to sleeping lightly. When you sleep rough you must be very aware of your surroundings, he told me.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Sebastian told how he would jump at any noises that he heard; not sure of what was out there in the night. He said that he still did that, even though he was in a house and safe. He still slept as though he was out on the streets, jumping at every slight sound. He said it would probably take him some time to get used to the fact that he was 'sleeping safe'—if he ever could. I asked him if he had family. He has a twin brother and a six-year-old nephew. The beaming smile on his face when he told me about his nephew showed his pride in family, just like I have with mine. After his last pay, he had a little money left and spent it on a remote control car for his nephew. Sebastian then asked me if I would like to see a photo of his nephew. When I said yes he proudly showed me a photo on his mobile phone. His hands were shaking as he showed me. He apologised for this and told me he was nervous as he had never before met anyone as important as me. I was taken aback. I quickly told Sebastian that he was just as important in our society as anyone and, given his courage in sharing his story with students at a local high school for their entry in the HELP film festival, Sebastian demonstrated just how important he is.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The one thing that really struck me was that, although Sebastian had very little and for 20 years had no place to call home, whenever he spoke about help for the homeless he always referred to 'the other blokes out there'. It was never just about him; he was always thinking of other people who were homeless. He was not doing it for himself. He did not want any thanks; he did not want any glory. He was doing it for those people that were sleeping rough last Monday night—and for those people that are sleeping rough tonight. I asked Sebastian, 'Now that you have a home, what would you like to do?' He told me that he loved art, and he would love to paint with oils and canvas, something he had never been able to do when he had nowhere to store materials.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I also met Gary, a mate of Sebastian's, who is currently homeless, although Gary considers himself lucky as he has accommodation at a shelter in Burnie at the moment. Unfortunately, he does not know how long he will be able to stay. This is dependent on whether other people with greater needs come along. Gary was also referring to 'the other blokes out there'—a real show of solidarity that he shared with Sebastian. Last Monday night, Gary actually stayed at Sebastian's place. It was a way of Sebastian saying thanks to him for coming along to the film festival to share his story.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">A key link between Sebastian and Gary was John from Anglicare. John has been assisting the homeless in north-west Tasmania for the past 18 years. He was clearly held in very high esteem by these men, and he told me of some problems he faces trying to assist people to find a home. To get a better understanding I have committed to do a shift with John in October this year. John, you have now got a commitment in the <span style="font-style:italic;">Hansard</span>. I hope to get a better understanding of what John does, how he helps some of the most vulnerable people in our society and how government can improve the way it delivers services.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Everyone has the right to a safe and secure home. A home is the foundation on which a person builds their life. Without a stable home, people—no matter what their age—struggle to live healthily, stay in training or education, or find and keep jobs. That is not good for them, their families, their communities or the country. That is why this Labor government made homelessness a national priority in 2007. We have commissioned the report <span style="font-style:italic;">The road home: a national approach to reducing homelessness</span>, which provided a comprehensive plan, and we have backed up that report with investment commitments totalling almost $5 billion in new funding since 2008. It is funding that follows from the research and seeks to provide support services and programs to assist people who are homeless or at risk of becoming homeless.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">It is also funding that includes the establishment or expansion of a number of initiatives in Tasmania. Anglicare are one of the major partners in the delivery of these services. They manage a 30-bed youth facility in Launceston called Thyne House. It is the only one of its kind in the state and provides long-term accommodation for those aged 16 to 25. Thyne House is full and achieving good results for the residents, with all but two of the young people engaged in employment, education or training. Many of the activities, such as cooking classes in the industrial kitchen, are also available to other young people in the Launceston community. This integration makes people in the community feel a part of the activities and culture at Thyne House, which makes the residents feel more a part the community.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We need to do more, and the HELP film festival is a tremendous effort in building the awareness that is fundamental to doing more. The festival was hosted by Kayne Tremills of ABC3 fame, who gave a great speech highlighting his own struggles with youth homelessness just a few years ago. Kayne went over and above what was required of an MC, giving the audience an insight into a struggle faced by a now popular TV host. Thank you, Kayne. Thank you to the HELP team from Youth and Family Focus: Brett, Belle and Nadine. I know you put in many extra hours to help students produce their insightful films—it was worth it. And thank you to the students and teachers who worked tirelessly to produce the informative films.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">There were 17 films, telling the stories of homelessness in communities right across Tasmania. Geeveston District High School, from the far south of the state, were the winners of the people's choice award. It was inspiring that they made the five-hour journey north to Devonport to the film screening to meet with the other entrants, share stories and make new friends. The Geeveston film included an interview with a student who had couch surfed for an extended period with school mates. The students told of the struggles for this young man—as he would not want to impose on friends but needed somewhere to crash each night—and of the struggles of his mates who wanted to help. Couch surfers must be recognised as homeless and services must be appropriately targeted.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The HELP film festival helped all who attended and participated to get a better understanding of homelessness in Tasmania. Hopefully it serves as some inspiration and motivation to all of us not only to consider those sleeping rough each night but to help out where we can. Everyone in this country needs a roof over their head, some people to keep them company and the opportunity to go to school or into training. These are basic things that all Australians should have.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">
                  <a href="KO6" type="MemberSpeech">
                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Senator HUMPHRIES</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Australian Capital Territory</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">19:57</span>):  I rise to talk tonight about a subject about which I am sure you know a little as well, Acting Deputy President Pratt—that is, Norfolk Island. Norfolk Island is a very beautiful Australian external territory in the Pacific Ocean. It is an absolutely gorgeous place to visit, is a place with lush vegetation and a very charming lifestyle, and is a place that has a great deal of heritage and history. The settlement at Kingston on Norfolk Island was established in 1788, the same year that Sydney was established, and much more of the early buildings and infrastructure of that period exists than does in Sydney.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I regret to tell the Senate that there is trouble in paradise. Norfolk Island is in very significant difficulties of an economic kind. Evidence of this is that the permanent population of the island has dropped from about 1,844 in 2007-08 to about 1,507 in January of this year. It is clear that many residents of the island are leaving in order to seek employment elsewhere, often in mining, as a result of the collapse of the local private sector. Unemployment is increasing as businesses on the island are cutting back employment and many businesses are folding.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Those who have been there will be aware that the major industry of Norfolk Island is tourism, but tourist numbers have decreased significantly in recent years, from about 40,000 a few years ago to about 25,000 last financial year. The average tourist stay is seven nights, but the number of visitors to the island over the last few weeks, even given a relatively long stay, has fallen to below 200 per week in the most recent set of statistics. I ask senators to consider the implication. Here is a small community supported substantially by tourism: a population of about 1,500 people supported by about 200 visitors a week does not add up to a very bright economic picture. In fact, 71 per cent of business income on the island and 68 per cent of private sector employment is derived from tourism related businesses. Clearly, there is a significant problem.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">So serious is this problem that the Norfolk Island government's budget for 2012-13 could more accurately be described as a budget for 2012 because it has only produced written figures, a documented budget, for the first six months of this financial year. It has such uncertainty about what will happen in the second half of the financial year it has not been able to produce a complete picture for the entire financial year. It has looked in the past and is looking again at the moment to the Australian government to see what assistance it can provide to a community which is in serious trouble. It seems to me there is very little doubt that some assistance will again have to be considered for the island as the number of business failures increases, the population drops and other signs of serious economic and social dislocation manifest themselves.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">There is some hope in sight for residents of Norfolk Island. In March last year the Minister for Regional Australia, Regional Development and Local Government, Simon Crean, signed an agreement with the Chief Minister of Norfolk Island, David Buffett, which was called the Norfolk Island Road Map. That agreement was designed to provide some change in outlook for the island by strengthening its economic diversity and in turn providing some support for an economy, for its social cohesion and resilience and therefore for the other things that make the island such a valuable place to live. That document essentially foreshadowed integrating the Norfolk Island tax system and welfare system more closely into Australia's, something which has not been the case throughout this island's independent history for much of the last 200 years. But what is concerning to me and others who observe affairs on the island is that it appears the road map process has ground to a halt. I am aware that the government of Norfolk Island and the government of the Commonwealth have been in discussions about this matter, but the fact remains that it is not entirely clear why the road map process has come to a halt. What is very clear is that, without some progress on this or some other reform for the island, the outlook for the island's economy and therefore for its community is very bleak indeed.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I am not used to quoting Labor members of other parliaments, but the ALP member of the Norfolk Island Assembly described the situation on the island as:</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">He has also said:</span>

                <span class="HPS-Small">People who have had to split up their families by going offshore to work and sending money back. I know there are people who have simply closed up their homes here on the island and abandoned them because they can't sell them, there's no resale market.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">A businessman on the island, Mr Brad Forrester, has said:</span>

                <span class="HPS-Small">This little island's in a state of recession. And a lot of people are finding it very difficult to make ends meet.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">The Chief Minister, David Buffett, has said:</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">
                  <span style="&#xD;&#xA;    font-size:9.5pt;&#xD;&#xA;  ">I worry, we all worry—that's part of the difficulty of this community at this moment. It's tremendous stress for each member of the Norfolk Island community.</span>
                </span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">There are other consequences of the failure to make progress on the road map. One of them, to give an example, is the effect of the carbon tax on Norfolk Island. The carbon tax is levied on freight fuels. Everything that arrives on the island comes either by boat or plane. Anything that comes from Australia is affected by those higher fuel charges, but the compensation that the Australian government has engineered for Australian citizens through the tax system of course is not available to citizens of Norfolk Island because they do not pay Australian taxes. They pay island taxes, but they are not part of the Australian income tax system so they are potentially seriously disadvantaged. When you go to the island and see that a litre of unleaded fuel costs $2.50 and a litre of fresh milk costs more than $7, it is not hard to realise that those higher freight costs can be a very serious exercise in compromising the standard of living of people on the island.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">My appeal tonight is for the parties here, the Australian government and the Norfolk Island government, to work quickly to find solutions to this problem. The road map is a good basis on which to provide relief to the island and to produce some optimism for its economy, but the road map seems to be experiencing a road block. It is incumbent on both sides to remove that road block as soon as possible. Until that happens I expect there will be more business failures, more people leaving the island and greater uncertainty for a part of the world which I think deserves a better outlook than it presently is facing.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">
                  <a href="J7Q" type="MemberSpeech">
                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Senator BACK</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Western Australia</span>—<span class="HPS-MinisterialTitles">Deputy Opposition Whip in the Senate</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">20:07</span>):  I rise this evening to share with the chamber and with the community a style of income management as it is being practised in Malaysia. Since 2009 there has been a quiet revolution in the support of low socioeconomic families particularly the mothers of families in Malaysia. This evening, some 20,000 needy families are receiving financial support through a foundation which I will explain in some more detail, and those families are receiving food and household items. The foundation trains the mothers of the households in household budgeting, offers skills in their development in microfinancing, and of course education for their children. It is all managed with security through a smart card system linked to a central database, and it actually had its origins here in Australia. I am very proud to be a founding director of the board of this foundation, which is known as MyKasih, Bahasa for 'love thy neighbour'. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">In its first three years of operation the number of families assisted has escalated from 1,000 per annum to 8,000 to 12,000, and we confidently expect that there will be 20,000 families next year. With five members in each family, that is 100,000 people. It spans 111 locations throughout Malaysia on both the mainland and peninsular Malaysia and all ethnic groups are represented.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">One of the fascinating aspects of this particular program is that 100 per cent of all money that is donated by the corporate sector and philanthropic families actually goes to the low socioeconomic families—100 per cent. The operating costs of the whole MyKasih Foundation are some six per cent of total expenditure and that is fully met by fundraising.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">How does the system work? As I mentioned it is a smart card system, so we give dignity to the mother of the low socioeconomic family that is identified as being in need so that she can go shopping in the same way as others and she can use a card which normally would be denied her because of her social or economic status. The system does not allow the purchase of alcohol or cigarettes or gambling products but concentrates in the supermarkets in Malaysia on foodstuffs with nutritional value and other essential items for the families. What has been an interesting aspect over the time the foundation has been operating is that the major suppliers now of staple foodstuffs are in fact providing generous discounts to the foundation, which are of course passed on to the families. Because the foundation now enjoys tax deductibility status from the government of Malaysia then those retailers who offer those discounts can themselves enjoy a tax benefit as a result.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">MyKasih is the brainchild of my very, very good friend and colleague, a philanthropist and very successful businessman Dr Ngau Boon Keat who is chairman of the Dialogasia group of companies, which are in Malaysia, Australia and New Zealand and throughout most areas of the world.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The germ for MyKasih came from a discussion I had with BK on Australia's social and security processes where, as we know, so much support is provided by the Australian taxpayer to families and to individuals through Centrelink and, regrettably, often with questionable benefits or improvements in the outcomes for those families. It was as a result of that discussion I had with the BK when he and I discussed the equivalent situation with low socioeconomic families in Malaysia, that we asked the question: would it not be possible to be able to use some software which the company, of which I was CEO at that time, had developed for retail petroleum sales in Malaysia? Would it not be possible for the software to be modified so that it could drive what became the centre of MyKasih. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Where we see the contrast in Malaysia and Australian is that our MyKasih experience is already yielding families who are reporting to us significant improvements in their household nutrition, school attendance, economic wellbeing, and in upskilling particularly, as I say, the mothers of these families. At the last meeting I attended in early June, I urged—and it will happen now—independent auditing to ensure that that anecdotal feedback is validated. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">BK through his generosity now offers the software free of charge to the MyKasih Foundation to operate the system and he looks forward to the day when it will be available throughout the Asian region, again, free of charge to countries where we think it will have application. In fact we have already had inquiries from Indonesia about the same system. MyKasih enjoys financial support from the oil majors in Malaysia such as Shell and Petronas, Chevron and Caltex, and many philanthropic families.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">But besides food aid, it also has allowed two emerging programs which I think would hold lessons for our country. Any teacher of course will tell you that a hungry child cannot learn, and it is not to our credit, I think, that even in my home state of Western Australia there are some 16,000 to 18,000 breakfasts served every week in schools in WA under the Foodbank program. When you try to explain that to the poorer people in Malaysian villages, they shake their heads and wonder why. Nevertheless, they see the way out of poverty is education. MyKasih is now piloting a bursary system, initially trialling in some 16 schools and embracing some 800 students from the same families we are supporting with food aid. Again, it is the same smart card through the same central database system that is allowing each child selected from that family to purchase educational texts and other tools and also foodstuffs, but only during the school year. Interestingly, it is contingent on them actually achieving at least the same if not an improved educational outcome every six months through that period.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The second one is what is referred to as 'Sew for Life'. It is a program where the mothers of recipient families are being supported, in this case by the Caltex organisation, in small group training sessions where they are not only taught sewing skills but are then supported through a microfinancing process to actually be able to purchase sewing machines and in that way repay the loan and, of course, build themselves a circumstance which will get them away from poverty.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">What can we learn from a program in Malaysia that had its origins in the thought process here? We know the Australian taxpayers are very generous in their support of those who are not working, cannot work or who are transitioning between jobs. It is of interest in our country that some 33 per cent of our budget is actually spent in social security and welfare payments channelled through Centrelink. Contrast that with our spending some 16 per cent of the budget on health, eight per cent on education and six per cent on defence. That is the relationship.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Of course, all Australians—Australian taxpayers and everybody in our community—want to see our funds spent prudently to ensure adequate food, clothing, housing, education and health for those who are in need. Of course equally, I think it is reasonable that we would not expect that these funds would be wasted at a time when they are so desperately needed by those families. I am very, very pleased to see that we are now moving towards income management for those families in Australia who do not themselves have the skills or the wherewithal to be able to manage their funds. Only recently I was interested to learn that in the Northern Territory—and obviously Senator Crossin would know these ladies far better than I—both Bess Price, who I think is a candidate in the upcoming Northern Territory election, and Alison Anderson, who I believe is the member for Macdonnell—if my information is correct—support this notion for those families who are themselves unable to manage this circumstance.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I commend what we are experiencing through MyKasih in Malaysia to the chamber. I believe that with the use of electronic technology, with sensible objectives and sound governance we are seeing lives changed. We are seeing poverty being relieved through education, we are seeing dignity for the mothers particularly of those families and I really believe that this is the way forward for us in the future.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">
                  <a href="e5x" type="MemberSpeech">
                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Senator POLLEY</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Tasmania</span>—<span class="HPS-MinisterialTitles">Deputy Government Whip in the Senate</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">20:17</span>):  Last week was Homeless Persons' Week, a week when all Australians are encouraged to think of those in our community who do not have a safe and secure home to call their own. This year's theme, 'HOMING IN on the <span style="font-style:italic;">real</span> issues of homelessness', was seeking to highlight the many different causes of homelessness.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We know that there are tens of thousands of Australians who are homeless on any given night: couch surfing, staying in motels or emergency shelters or sleeping rough. It is estimated that Tasmania has 2,500 people who do not have an address or somewhere they can call home. Per capita, our state has twice the national average of homeless people.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">There are many reasons for homelessness, from domestic violence and family violence to relationship breakdown, substance abuse, mental illness, financial hardship, youth unemployment and disengagement. Of the people seeking assistance from specialist services in the last three months of last year, 59 per cent were women, almost half were under the age of 25 and 18 per cent were children under the age of 10.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Everyone deserves a safe and secure home. A home is the foundation on which a person builds their life. Without a stable home, people—no matter their age—struggle to live healthily, to stay in training or education or to find and keep jobs. That is not good for them, it is not good for their families, it is not good for their communities and it is certainly not good for our country. That is why this Labor government has made homelessness a national priority. In our white paper on homelessness the Labor government committed to two ambitious headline goals: to halve all homelessness and by 2020 to offer supported accommodation to all rough sleepers who seek it. This government has committed almost $5 billion in new funding since 2008 to provide support services and programs to assist people who are homeless or at risk of becoming homeless.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">In my home state of Tasmania more than $32 million in funding under the national partnership agreement on homelessness is supporting six new or expanded homelessness initiatives. I would like to talk about two of the new facilities in Launceston that I visited, and talk about another service that I have assisted with on one occasion last winter.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">In Launceston, the Door of Hope Christian Church established a 20-unit accommodation facility in Thistle Street. This is part of the old Coats Patons Woollen Mills. The units were developed with federal grants and are now managed by Anglicare. The facility aims to be a halfway house for singles, couples and families, to assist homeless people to acquire the knowledge and skills to be able to move on into the community. While it is expected that this may take 12 to 18 months or even longer, there is no intention to provide permanent long-term care accommodation. The staffing in the facilities is to support people in learning to shop, how to prepare meals, personal care, how to prepare for education and employment and how to budget their money. Without the support and funds from this government, support facilities like this would not have happened. For too long homeless people in this country were ignored and neglected.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Thyne House is another facility, in Brisbane Street in central Launceston. That is another new facility. The Thyne House development is the first of its kind in Launceston. The initial thinking for the project focused on homeless young people, but following consultation with the community it became clear that this was a much wider opportunity to provide quality, well-located and affordable housing for young people close to jobs, schools, transport, shops and other services. Accordingly, the development now responds to a shortage of accommodation in Launceston for low-income wage earners and young people coming in from the country to work and further their studies, as well as for those young people who need tailored and specific support.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Depending on the residential mix, there are one or two permanent staff on site during working hours, and their role is to assist young people in their transition to independence. The support service offers the opportunity to develop life skills, leading to independent living; access to services such as training, education and employment readiness; general health care, including mental health and wellbeing support; access to flexible and long-term support services; connections with friends and family; and opportunities for participation in the community and for gaining self-confidence and a sense of control over their lives.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">There are 30 self-contained units and a caretaker cottage. Most residents are young people accessing employment and education within the city—for example, apprentices or students whose work or study means that they must move to Launceston but for whom there is no affordable accommodation. Thyne House has a variety of open and private outdoor spaces, gardens and terraces. There is parking for residents, site managers and visiting services consistent with local government regulations. Reception is a single point with good security. An on-site manager will be available 24 hours a day. The on-site manager has an office located near reception and lives on site, as I said.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The independent units are a mix of one-bedroom and studio units. They are of high quality, with full kitchens and ensuites. Soundproofing is in line with standards associated with any private or public facility with units in close proximity to each other. The universal design features of the units are readily modifiable so that some rooms are accessible for people with physical disabilities. These units are based on design principles that maximise residential privacy and independence. The community areas for residents, away from the units of accommodation, include a laundry; kitchen and dining areas; common and lounge rooms, including a TV and games room; low-maintenance gardens with seating and private open spaces; and a training and learning room with information technology infrastructure. The innovative design allows a variety of community uses. Once again, it has been this government and the previous Labor government that made sure that homelessness was on the agenda and that brought about the delivery of the much-needed injection of funds so that facilities like this can be established throughout the country.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We have to understand that there is not one solution that fits all homeless people's needs. I went to the United States a number of years ago to look at homelessness and how it affects families. I visited shelters that were run by not-for-profit charitable organisations, Christian shelters and government-provided facilities. Each and every situation just brought home to me how much further advanced we are here in Australia. In fact, when I met with government representatives from the various states that I visited while I was in the US, they kept coming back to the same circumstances: that they look to Australia for the way that we deliver services.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The sort of thing that you have to consider is that it is not just young people and families that are homeless. Unfortunately, there are also growing numbers of women that find themselves homeless. Because there was lack of support with superannuation, there are a lot of women in their 50s and 60s who, for a number of reasons, find themselves no longer able to afford accommodation, and too many of those are finding themselves in shelters, sleeping rough or having to rely on families and friends.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">But there is another wonderful service in Launceston, and in fact it operates in other cities as well. I am talking about City Mission and the mission's outreach van and mobile kitchen trailer, which services the Launceston community on Friday and Saturday nights between 10 pm and 2 am. Last winter Geoff Lyons, the member for Bass, and I spent the evening talking to those that were dropping by for a warm cup of soup or a cup of coffee and some biscuits. Many of those people just wanted someone to have a talk to about their issues and the things that were troubling them, and basically to have some human contact. So we have to always remember that these people need our support. Although last week was Homeless Persons Week, when we were encouraging people to think about this issue, we should be thinking about that every night. If you are here in Canberra and you have experienced some of the cold weather, that has to be a reminder to you that there are too many who are still sleeping rough and need our support. We are a rich country and we should be looking after those who need it most.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">
                  <a href="00AOQ" type="MemberSpeech">
                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Senator MOORE</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Queensland</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">20:27</span>):  Last week at Buderim, Minister Plibersek came and opened the extension of a new therapy centre at Bloomhill Cancer Help. Bloomhill is an extraordinary place. Those of us who have the honour to be friends of Bloomhill know what a special place this is. I first heard of the organisation when we were involved many years ago in the cancer inquiry held by the community affairs committee. Margaret Gargan, who was the founder of Bloomhill, came and talked to us in our community about her vision for how you could have a multidisciplinary team focused on people who were working through their own experience with cancer—not just themselves but their families—and how they could find a place of security, support and sanctuary. That indeed is Bloomhill. Minister Plibersek was able to share in that experience last week, and I am sure that she will remember the joy and pleasure of the many faces of people who came to share in the experience.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Bloomhill Cancer Help supports people affected by cancer. It provides a unique service which meets specific needs in our community. Bloomhill offers immediate emotional support for any person going through the process of being diagnosed and working through treatments. It works with, for and around the person and their family. It focuses on the emotional and practical needs of people and also looks at where they feel strong and how the organisation, through its range of therapies, can work with that strength. It focuses on survival and real quality of life. It is part of its philosophy that it aims to walk with the client on the journey from the time of diagnosis, through treatment and on through the various stages, working through those periods of grief and loss. It is genuinely a quiet haven of peace and tranquillity that provides immediate solace.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Bloomhill has established its credibility with a whole range of people on the Sunshine Coast. Although its focus is, I think, very close to paradise at Buderim, it is known internationally for the work it provides. It concentrates on working in a multidisciplinary team approach. It works with general practitioners, specialists, nursing services and other health care professionals to have a genuine holistic approach to cancer.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">When you come to our centre, you know that peace and serenity are around you. Set on 10 acres of lush vegetation in the very heart of Buderim, it has been a haven for those working with the issues around cancer since 1997. Margaret Gargan talked to us and described herself as 'a woman possessed' as she, who had worked as an oncology nurse for many years, received her own diagnosis of breast cancer. It was a truly harrowing time, and she felt that there was not appropriate community support, so she decided with her professional experience that she would develop a model of care that supports people in the way they need to be supported. She has had experience working in the medical system and knows that the medical system alone does not fulfil the needs that people have.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">In 2003, when we had our cancer inquiry, this was still seen as something fairly innovative. Now we know that, in the short period of time since, it has become the accepted model. Margaret went on to say when I was speaking with her last week that her dream is that there is a Bloomhill experience for people no matter where they live in this country. It is the idea that, working with community, people can establish what they need in their local area.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The process operates through an initial assessment by a registered nurse and then through the range of therapies that are available on site. It does not matter whether it is art therapy, music therapy, massage, reiki—all those things that we hear about are there for people to choose to use or not. It also focuses very clearly on those who are caring, so it is not unusual to walk into this place and find kids playing in the yard, people cooking, people laughing, people talking together as well as having areas of quiet peace. This place belongs to the Bloomhill family.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The Bloomhill philosophy of facilitating 'no regrets' recognises that it is the 'if only's that cripple us: if only we had said that, if only we had done that. At Bloomhill people are constantly striving for new ways of identifying and assessing needs while keeping the fees very low to ensure it is accessible for everyone. Cancer, we know, makes people worried, anxious and depressed not just about their condition but also about the impact it has on their family and friends. This gives people time out and a chance to look at a range of options which are not always available in the standard medical model.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Clients are of course encouraged to maintain medical treatment because it is not an either/or situation, but the therapies that are at Bloomhill—the space and the time—are complementary. They work with the person. I cannot stress too much that it is about the person. One of the things that we laughed about last week was the fact that the service has a large number of clients and families that come through, but the volunteer register actually outnumbers the people who are using the therapy centre for their own needs. People are empowered and enjoy their experience of being part of the Bloomhill family, and that is the terminology that is used consistently. There are wide-ranging services, and they are all listed on the website so people can see.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Bloomhill has always been self-funded, relying on public support and goodwill. Last week we also had the annual walk, and a number of people turned out publicly in Bloomhill blue to show that they care and are part of the community itself. I particularly want to congratulate the whole team, who work so hard to ensure that people do have this place of security and peace. To Jenny Caroll, who is the chairman of the board; to Mervat Thompson, an old friend and current CEO; to Raelene Boyle, who amongst all her other work is the patron of the Bloomhill centre; to them and the team of volunteers, carers and therapists: thank you. Thank you from me for the experience I have had in working with you, but thank you also from so many people who have experienced being part of your family and having the support and professional help that you provide.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Bloomhill have a series of opportunity or op shops that are placed across the whole of the Sunshine Coast. This is the main form of income for the organisation because they have not ever had government funding. The money that we provided through our government for the extension of the therapy centre was the first formal government funding that the organisation had received. As part of the community, they rely on the community, and certainly it has been a wonderful process of having people who have gone through working at Bloomhill and then found ways to volunteer and give back to the organisation.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I think it is important that we see this model at work. One of the recommendations of our cancer inquiry many years ago was to ensure that this multidisciplinary team approach becomes standard and is accessible to people no matter where they are actually working with their own illnesses. Unfortunately, it is not everywhere, but in the time since we had the inquiry we have seen that this model is much more common. It is people like the workers and volunteers at Bloomhill who provide hope and encouragement for all of us. I think it is a place that welcomes visitors—as I said earlier, it is very close to paradise when you go to this area—but, once you do see the work that is done there, you feel the serenity and the dichotomy of serenity and energy that is part of the process. You know that anything is possible.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">So it is my real pleasure to continue to be a part of the family of Bloomhill. It gives me great hope for our future, and I think it is part of the way that we as a community look at different ways of treating people who are ill and working with them rather than on them.</span>

                  </a>  Tonight I would like to share with members information about Sri Lanka. I recently received some distressing information in my email inbox, which paints a disturbing picture of the day-to-day realities for Tamils in Sri Lanka. I commend the Commission for Justice and Peace of the Catholic Diocese of Jaffna in Sri Lanka for taking the brave decision to author and release their statement. I imagine that their honesty and integrity will put them in grave danger at the hands of a brutal regime that has so far tolerated no dissent. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I have been following the situation in post-war Sri Lanka very closely for some time now. Although I have been told by my contacts in the Tamil community of the worsening situation, I was shocked to learn of the extent of the militarisation of Tamil land, the eradication of historical sites of Tamil ownership and occupation such as the renaming of sites to erase Tamil names, the resettlement of army personnel and Sinhalese families in Tamil areas, the abduction of Tamils and the increasing fear in which the Tamil community live each day. Women and girls in the north in particular are in a very perilous security situation. This is causing immense grief to the more than 60,000 Tamils living in Australia. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The comments from the Commission for Justice and Peace of the Catholic Diocese of Jaffna are in sharp contrast to the official statements issued by the Sri Lankan government. Its official position ignores the tyranny and hardship that Tamil communities endure under the Rajapaksa regime. I do not have time to read the entire statement, and so I urge that you do read the full statement by the commission. It is on my website and other websites. It paints a graphic and troubling picture of the realities facing Tamils in post-war Sri Lanka. Here are some excerpts:</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Small">The widely advertised ‘war for peace’ came to an end more than three years ago. Yet the fruits of this peace are yet to be enjoyed by the people in the North, who were most affected mentally, physically and economically. This reality is verified by the day to day events which are taking place here. The hope for a real peace is declining day by day. The Commission for Justice and Peace of the Catholic Diocese of Jaffna feels that it is its historic duty to point out this in order that a way may open to establish a just, democratic and peaceful community in Sri Lanka.</span>
              </p>

              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Small">According to the reports given by the Sri Lankan Government to the outside world and the international leaders and their representatives only a few thousands of displaced persons who are still in the camps have yet to be resettled of the 300,000 people who were evacuated from the war-ravaged Wanni area and the resettled people have been given the facilities of decent housing and means to restart their lives. The balance three to five thousands of people still in the camps will be resettled in a matter of two to three months and will be provided with all the facilities according to the Government sources. The Government says that 95% of the displaced persons have been resettled already. But the UN reports say that … 117,888 persons are yet to be resettled permanently. </span>

              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Small">Taking into consideration the resettled people whom the Government claims as 95% of the total displaced, the conditions of substantial number of them are far from satisfactory. Some villages and fertile lucrative lands of these people have already been taken over for their usage by the security forces to establish permanent camps and naval bases. When it came to the resettlement, the displaced people after undergoing immense inconveniences in temporary shelters for years have been forced to go to areas shown by the Government which are not in any way helpful to continue with their former work and find their livelihood. </span>

              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Small">The plight of the displaced people from Mullikulam in the Mannar district is also disturbing. Some years ago they were asked to leave their homes with the assurance that they would be allowed to come back shortly. Hence they left their homes only with few of their belongings. But even after many years they were not allowed to get back and they were living temporarily in several part of Mannar without proper work and with little assistance to find their livelihood. Now they are allowed to get back to their villages. When they went they were not allowed to occupy their houses. Hence they had to find shelter under trees in the elephant-infested jungles. Their uncertain journey back home continues.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Small">… The NGOs who are willing to give them some relief are obstructed from doing so due to political reasons. The ‘pass system’ for fishing affects them also. When they see the fishermen from the South fishing in the sea in their vicinity they are not able to venture into the sea freely to earn their livelihood.… they are afraid to speak out as they are surrounded by the army and navy whose heavy presence and interference affects their day to day life. </span>

                <span class="HPS-SmallBullet">The incidents of ordinary people being attacked by the army for no rhyme or reason are not rare occurrences in the North. Few weeks ago at … Point Pedro there were some civilians standing at night during the festival in a Temple close by. Some soldiers who happened to pass-by attacked these people without any provocation whatsoever. When these people went to the Police-Station to lodge a complaint, the police refused to take down any complaint…. </span>

                <span class="HPS-SmallBullet">A lot of propaganda is given by the Government to the local and international media that there has been a substantial reduction of the number of soldiers in the North and vast areas occupied hitherto by the army have been vacated to enable resettlement of people displaced from there. But the ground reality is substantially different. Army presence and movement is very much there without any major change. In some places temporary army camps are converted into well-entrenched permanent bases. When some houses and lands here and there are given back to the owners with much propaganda, large areas of land and even village are cordoned off surreptitiously for ‘security reasons’. From Valikamam North alone people from 23 Grama Sevaka divisions are still not able to get back to their lands or houses. … There are also some moves to take over some institutions such as the prestigious Government Teachers Training College complex by the security forces…. </span>

                <span class="HPS-Small">In a war the accepted international norm which is followed is that the winners show respect to the cemetery of the losers. Before the end of the war there had been many war-cemeteries in the North, which used to be well-maintained. Even during the ceasefire time (from 2002 to 2006) the militants were allowed to maintain them and the people used to frequent these places to remember their dead and to pray for them. Once the war was over, all these cemeteries were bulldozed without any trace and in some places new buildings and even army-camps have been established. The security forces are also very vigilant in preventing any prayer-service or function to remembrance of not only the dead militants but also the civilians…. </span>

                <span class="HPS-Small">Every day we read in the dailies and hear of burglaries, robberies and murders and other violent incidents in the North which is something unprecedented. Most of those who carry out these are masked or wear full-helmets and have in their possession weapons which are used by the army and the armed-groups aligned to the government … We also can observe the army posted all over and the police patrolling the streets even at nights. It is surprising that these robbers are able to elude all these vigilant watches. In the course of these robberies those who have resisted have been murdered. The LLRC in one of its recommendations stated that the armed groups who are with the Government should be disarmed. This has not happened as it is evident from the liberal use of these sophisticated weapons during the robberies etc.</span>

First huge statues of Buddha and Dagobas were erected either in or near the army camps with full participation of the security forces. Some of these were erected near permanent Hindu Temples which had been there for centuries.

It observation must have put the government in a predicament. It is very clear that the Bishop presented his findings were not conjectures but based on firm evidence taken from Government records. In spite of that coming to the Bishop’s House and having an inquiry is nothing but an act of intimidation.

Their hopes are far from being realized. Still there is the pass system as well as time limitation in some places. In spite of the assurance given by the Minister of Fisheries of not allowing anybody new from the South to the region of Mullaithievu, other than those who were fishing there before the war, hundreds of new people are coming from the South. The security forces there are making all the arrangements for their stay and for fishing. These people are using the methods and the fishing gear which are not allowed in the North.</span>

Extraordinary (political) transfers of judges, prolongation of cases which need to be attended urgently indefinitely, keeping the suspects in custody for many years especially the political prisoners and those who had helped the LTTE and not giving information about them etc are some of the phenomena of this travesty of justice. ‘Justice delayed is justice denied’, is very relevant in this regard.</span>

This open letter attests that nothing could be further from the truth. History has shown that the current government of Sri Lanka does not treat the Tamils of Sri Lanka with equality, dignity and justice. I commend this account of the reality of life for Tamils in Sri Lanka to the Senate and again thank the Commission for Justice and Peace of the Catholic Diocese of Jaffna for issuing this statement to inform us better about the current situation in their country.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Small">(1)  Those categories are headings used for the purpose of grouping documents associated with the public submissions process.

                <span class="HPS-Small">(2) The categories used for submissions analaysis and reporting are outlined in the Overview of Public Submissions Report, available on the Department's website. Each submission was categorised in a number of ways, including by its origins (whether it was from an individual or from organisation; what interest it represented out of 11 categories of interest; whether it had been generated through a campaign or not; whether it had been submitted online or via email or by post; etc.) and the the feedback it contained (what broad theme(s) it covered; what specific comment(s) it made with respect to the marine reserves proposal).   </span>

                <span class="HPS-Small">(1) The seasonal outlooks published by the Bureau of Meteorology provide what are known as a “probablilistic” forecasts. They do not forecast a definite outcome, but rather the chances or odds that a given area will be hotter or cooler, or wetter or drier, than the median value. They also do not predict how much above or below median.  </span>

                <span class="HPS-Small">Various measures of skill or accuracy can be used to assess a probabilistic forecast. In general, these measures compare the  most likely (ie probabilistic) outcome to the subsequently observed outcome, and in turn how this would compare to a simple forecast scheme such as using climatology. </span>
