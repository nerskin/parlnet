                    <span class="HPS-OfficeSpeech">The PRESIDENT</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Time">12:32</span>):  I wish to inform you that on the 7 November 2016 the Senate referred to the Court of Disputed Returns questions about the eligibility of Rodney Norman Culleton to sit as a senator. The court delivered its judgment in the matter on Friday, 3 February 2017. Today, I have tabled a copy of the order made by the Court and a copy of its reasons for judgment. To quote the judgment summary published by the Court:</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Small">…the High Court unanimously held that Rodney Norman Culleton was a person who was convicted and subject to be sentenced for an offence punishable by imprisonment for one year or longer at the time of the 2016 federal election, and therefore was incapable of being chosen as a Senator under s 44(ii) of the Constitution.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">…   …   …</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Small">The subsequent annulment of that conviction had no effect on that state of affairs.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The court ordered that the resulting vacancy in the representation of Western Australia be filled by way of a special count of the ballot papers. I will inform the Senate of the outcome of that process in due course.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">While the matter referred by the Senate was on foot, Mr Culleton became subject to disqualification under sections 44 and 45 of the Constitution. In a proceeding in the Federal Court under the Bankruptcy Act 1966, Balwyn Nominees Pty Ltd v Culleton [2016] FCA 1578, a sequestration order was made against the estate of Rodney Norman Culleton on 23 December 2016. The same bankruptcy was entered on the National Personal Insolvency Index on that same day. The court ordered a stay of proceedings under the sequestration order for a period of 21 days, which was later extended, which had the effect of pausing and restraining certain proceedings under the Bankruptcy Act. However, such a stay does not prevent the order itself operating.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Section 44 (iii) of the Constitution provides that a person who:</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Small">… is an undischarged bankrupt or insolvent …</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Small">…   …   …</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Small">shall be incapable of being chosen or of sitting as a senator …</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Section 45 provides that if a senator becomes subject to such disability, that senator or member's place shall thereupon become vacant. This does not depend upon any decision of the Senate or of myself as the President. It is a necessary and automatic consequence of the declaration that a serving senator is an undischarged bankrupt, that his or her place as a senator becomes vacant.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">This was later confirmed in the Federal Court judgment handed down on 3 February 2017, dismissing Mr Culleton's appeal in the bankruptcy matter, which records:</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Small">The prima facie effect of the order of the Court on 23 December 2016 was to cause the vacation of his office as a Senator for Western Australia …</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I received documentation from the Inspector-General in Bankruptcy on 10 January this year and from the Federal Court Registry the following day, which recorded the status of Rodney Norman Culleton as an undischarged bankrupt. On 11 January, having received that advice, I therefore notified the Governor of Western Australia, Her Excellency the Hon. Kerry Sanderson AC, that there was a vacancy in the representation of that state as a consequence of the disqualification of Senator Culleton. I also informed Her Excellency that the method for filling that vacancy depended on the matter then before the Court of Disputed Returns. Those documents were presented to the Senate out of session on 12 January.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Mr Culleton sought, by several means, to avoid the consequences of his bankruptcy. He wrote to me on 4 January 2017 asking that I recall the Senate to resolve his status as a senator. I made a statement on 9 January outlining my response, noting that I was not empowered to recall the Senate in such circumstances and that, in any case, the Constitution did not give the Senate discretion to disregard a disqualifying event such as the bankruptcy of one its members.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Mr Culleton, through his lawyers, later served a summons upon me and upon the Attorney-General, seeking, among other things, orders restraining me from taking steps to remove him from the Senate consequent upon his becoming bankrupt. That summons was dismissed in the High Court on 31 January past. While the Federal Court rejected Mr Culleton's appeal on the bankruptcy matter on 3 February also, the bankruptcy disqualification is somewhat academic given the judgement of the Court of Disputed Returns.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I have been asked two questions, in particular, about the consequences of Mr Culleton sitting in the Senate despite being ineligible to do so. The first is what effect his disqualification has on Senate proceedings in which he took part and the second is whether Mr Culleton will be required to repay any salary or allowances paid to him as a senator. On the first matter, <span style="font-style:italic;">Odgers</span><span style="font-style:italic;">'</span><span style="font-style:italic;"> Australian Senate Practice</span> notes:</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Small">The presence in the Senate of a senator found not to have been validly elected or to be disqualified does not invalidate the proceedings of the Senate in which the senator participated …</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">If you wish to read it, you will find that on page 174 of the new edition. This matter was determined by the High Court in the 1907 case Vardon v O'Loghlin (1907) 5 Commonwealth Law Report<span style="font-style:italic;"></span>201, per Griffiths Chief Justice, at 208, and restated by the court in the 1988 case involving Robert Wood, 167 Commonwealth Law Report.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">On the second matter I am advised that in previous cases opinions were provided by attorneys-general that those whose elections were declared void were not entitled to retain salary payments made to them. Currently the Remuneration Tribunal Act 1973 provides for the payment of salaries to senators. Under section 16A of that act any such benefit paid without authority becomes a debt due to the Commonwealth. In earlier cases such debts have in effect been waived. However, I am advised that the decision whether to waive such debts is a decision for the government and not the Senate. I have written to the finance minister seeking further advice on this matter.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">For the information of senators I have tabled, with the usual start of day documents, each of the statements I made on this matter in January, together with the published reasons for each of the judgements I have referred to. I thank senators for bearing with me on that long statement.</span>

I consider it my duty to inform the Senate of this decision prior to making any public comment. After a membership spanning my entire adult life, having been a state president and a federal vice-president of the party, this has been a very difficult decision for me—perhaps the most difficult one of my political life. I stand here today both reluctant and relieved: reluctant because this decision has weighed heavy on my heart but relieved because, whilst it is difficult, I believe it is the right thing to do.</span>

In short, the body politic is failing the people of Australia and it is clear that we need to find a better way. The level of public disenchantment with the major parties, the lack of confidence in our political process and the concern about the direction of our nation are very strong. This is a direct product of us, the political class, being out of touch with the hopes and aspirations of the Australian people.</span>

I have spoken of the need to restore faith in our political system and to put principle back into politics. I regret that too often these warnings have been ignored by those who perhaps needed to hear them most. It really is time for a better way, for a conservative way. </span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">The enduring beauty of the conservative tradition is that it looks to the past to all that is good and great to inform the future. It is a rich paradox where the established equips us for the new. And so today I begin something new, built on enduring values and principles that have served our nation so well for so long. It is a political movement of Australian conservatives, a community of individual Australians who will share their unique gifts and talents to chart a better way for our nation.</span>

Today I take that first step, knowing the direction in which I will be heading, and I hope that those who are truly concerned for the future of our nation will choose to join me. Mr President, in light of this you may like to consider the seating arrangements in the Senate in your further deliberations. I thank the Senate for their time.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Small">That the Senate take note of the statement.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">What we have seen today is extraordinary—a government senator leaving the government benches on ideological grounds and on grounds of conviction and philosophy. What we have seen today really tells us something very important about this government, because Senator Bernardi's statement is emblematic of a government that is bitterly divided, a government that is coming apart at the seams and a government so riven with internal division it is more focused on its own issues than on the matters that matter most to Australians. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Senator Bernardi's resignation is not a cause of the deep divisions we now see on open display in the Senate chamber; it is a symptom. It is a symptom, because we know Senator Bernardi's view is far from an isolated one in this government We know that amongst those opposite he is one of many who believe that this government stands for nothing, that this government is led by a man who does not believe most of the things he is now forced to say and that this is a government that is riven with factionalism, dissent and distrust. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">This resignation is a consequence of the failure of leadership by the Prime Minister, because the Prime Minister is leading a government that does not have an agenda and that does not have a philosophical framework. This is a government led by a man who has sold his soul for leadership—a prime minister so weak he is only allowed to remain in the job for as long as he betrays virtually everything he ever stood for. He is a man who used to believe in marriage equality; now he is not even allowed to grant his members the right to vote. He is a man who used to believe in an Australian republic; he is not even allowed to talk about it now. He is a man who said he understood the need to change the tax system so young people could actually aspire to homeownership; he is now not even allowed to talk about negative gearing. He is a man who came to the job vowing to end the three-word slogan who is forced to stand up every night, endlessly repeating the three-word slogans of his predecessor. And, of course, he is a man who used to believe that action on climate change was actually important. As has been said, I do not think Tony Abbott was much of a Prime Minister, but he was a hell of a lot better at being Tony Abbott than Malcolm Turnbull will ever be.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">There are very few issues—in fact, there are almost no issues—upon which I agree with Senator Bernardi. But I do respect one thing: he does stand up for what he believes in. He is clearly no longer prepared to stomach the rank hypocrisy of a leader who clings to office by parroting views in which he does not believe. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">But there is another lesson here for the Prime Minister: it is never enough. No matter how much you bend, no matter how many times you sell your soul to the hard Right of the party, no matter how often you betray everything you have ever stood for, it is never enough. That is what Senator Bernardi has today demonstrated. For every concession, another one will be demanded; when you cave in on that, they will just ask for another; and, when you cave in on that, another will be demanded of you.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">So I say to those opposite and I say to the Prime Minister: time to call time on this farce. Why don't you do a little of what Senator Bernardi suggested? He said, 'Put principle back into politics.' Well, Australians await this from Malcolm Turnbull.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">
                  <a href="008W7" type="MemberSpeech">
                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Senator BRANDIS</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Queensland</span>—<span class="HPS-MinisterialTitles">Attorney-General, Vice-President of the Executive Council and Leader of the Government in the Senate</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">12:48</span>):  The Liberal Party, the coalition, the government, are disappointed by the course that Senator Bernardi has taken this morning. We believe that he has done the wrong thing, because only seven months ago Senator Bernardi was elected by the people of South Australia to serve in the Senate as a Liberal Senator. There are a variety of views in the Liberal Party, as there are a variety of views in the Labor Party. But, only seven months ago, Senator Bernardi was happy to stand before the people of South Australia and to say that he sought their endorsement to serve for a six-year term as a Liberal senator. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Now, Senator Bernardi has been a participant in debates in the Liberal Party, as have I, and, in the seven months since the federal election, nothing has changed. There is no policy for which the Liberal Party and the government stand today which is not the same as the platform on which Senator Bernardi sought election by the people of South Australia only seven months ago. In view of that, we find it perplexing that, when there is no difference between the policy and platform on which he sought re-election, and the policy and platform of the government today, he would feel the need to take this course. There was no need for him to take this course, because as former Prime Minister Mr Howard famously said, the Liberal Party is 'a broad church'. It can accommodate people like Senator Bernardi and it can accommodate people of more moderate views than Senator Bernardi, and it is genius. The reason why it has been the government of Australia for longer than any other political party is that people within the Liberal Party have understood that. Senator Bernardi, a former state president and a former federal vice-president, should understand it as well.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We in the government will deal with Senator Bernardi as we deal with all members of the crossbench—in a professionally courteous and respectful way. We will treat him as a colleague, and for many members of the government he will continue to be a personal friend. But we do not condone what he has done. Might I say, that if one seeks to restore confidence in the political class, it is a poor way to begin by breaking the promise one makes to one's electors to serve for the political party on whose platform and on whose ticket one stood. What Senator Bernardi has done today is not a conservative thing to do, because breaking faith with the electorate, breaking faith with the people who voted for you, breaking faith with the people who have supported you through thick and thin for years and indeed decades is not a conservative thing to do. Nevertheless, as I said, we will continue to treat Senator Bernardi courteously and professionally as a colleague. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">There is one respect in which, of course, Senator Bernardi stands in a different position from the other members of the Senate crossbench. Unlike the other members of the Senate crossbench, Senator Bernardi was elected to support the policies of this government and, whether within the Liberal Party or now as a member of the crossbench, what we will be seeking of Senator Bernardi is to do no more than to support the policies and measures on which he stood when he sought re-election by the people of South Australia in July of last year.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Senator Wong predictably seeks to make political points; she is entitled to do that. I am not going to engage in a slanging match with Senator Wong, other than to remind her that it is not unknown on either side of politics for people to become unhappy and unsettled in the political party in which they were elected to represent and to leave. We saw that in the parliament before last with Mr Peter Slipper in the other place. We saw it in this Senate some 20 years ago in the case of former Senator Mal Colston; but, unlike the Labor Party on the occasion of the Mal Colston defection, we will not be abusing Senator Bernardi. We will not be engaged—</span>

We will not be doing that. We will be treating Senator Bernardi as a professional colleague, with appropriate professional courtesy. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Senator Wong, you observed cheaply, if I may say so, that there is division on my side of politics. The departure of one person from a party room of more than 100 hardly constitutes division, particularly when I look across this chamber and I see not one party of the Left, but two. I see the 26 Labor Party senators but I also see their mortal rivals and enemies, the nine Greens senators. Do you know, Mr President, that if you examine the statistics from the last federal election they reveal something very instructive. Do you know that, if you were a young Australian, a person under the age of 30, whose political sympathies lay with the Left, you were as likely to vote for the Greens party as you were to vote for the Australian Labor Party. So, please, Senator Wong, we will not be having any lectures from you about division in politics when your entire electoral base is being gradually, indeed, not so gradually but fairly rapidly eroded by your rivals on the Left of politics—the Australian Greens. Nor will we be hearing sententious lectures from you, Senator Wong—the person who sits in the same party room that former Senator Mal Colston once sat. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">So, Mr President, this is a sad day for the Liberal Party. It is a sad day when somebody leaves the family. Senator Bernardi will have to account to the Australian people and to his own conscience about how he can continue to sit in this parliament, having been elected as a Liberal—but that is a matter for him. We in the government will proceed with the important business of making Australia secure and prosperous. We have a very busy agenda in 2017, and we look forward to working with every senator for the best interests of our country. </span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">Look at the capitulation that we have seen from this Prime Minister on issues that he believed were issues of substance. Remember this was the Prime Minister who said that he would never lead a party that was not as committed to climate change as he is, but several days ago he was spruiking clean coal—straight out of the Senator Bernardi manual of conservative politics. He was out there spruiking for something that does not exist. We have entered fairy land here. On marriage equality, we have a man who has marched at a Mardi Gras now capitulating to the far Right in his own party. Perhaps he was convinced by Senator Bernardi's persuasive arguments around bestiality and the consequences that might flow if we allow people to marry each other, regardless of gender and sexuality. They are disgraceful contributions from a man who has not got the courage to put his views to the Australian electorate. On the republic, Malcolm Turnbull—the man who led the charge for Australia to become a republic—is now saying we cannot do anything until the passing of the Queen. Surely the point of a republic is that we do not have to take orders from the Queen, because we would be independent of the British monarchy. This is a man who has sold out on the most fundamental principles, who has so utterly capitulated to the likes of Senator Bernardi, Mr Christensen and so many others in his party room.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I heard this morning one of the Labor Party members refer to the Prime Minister as being paraded around like a prize bull at the Easter show, being paraded through the ring and being led by the nose by those on the far right. This is a prize bull who has now been knackered. This is a prize bull who now stands for nothing, incapable of doing anything. This is a man who is so hollow. This is a man who is so lacking in integrity and substance that perhaps he should join Senator Bernardi and they can form their own party: the Hollowmen. When it comes to taking a stand on the issues that matter—on climate change, on whether this country should end discrimination in marriage, on becoming a republic or indeed on taking on the dangerous lunatic that is now the President of the United States of America—what we see instead from this Prime Minister is appeasement. It is time for this Prime Minister to decide what he stands for and to ensure that the Australian community is given the opportunity to vote for somebody who at the very least will take a position based on principle, rather than for a Prime Minister who has sold out on his core beliefs and has capitulated to the likes of Senator Bernardi.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I say to Senator Bernardi: what is the point? How much further can the coalition go? What do they need to do to satisfy you? Zero taxes, is that what you want? No public health care or education in this country, is that what you want? How much further can this government go in tearing up the social safety net, in shredding universal health care and education, before the likes of Senator Bernardi and Mr Christensen will be satisfied?</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The lesson here is very, very clear. Senator Bernardi is 6½ foot of ego and not an inch of integrity. If he had had the guts to do it a year ago he might have got some grudging respect, but to do it just after he has been given a six-year term shows the sort of person that he is. As for the Prime Minister, hopefully he will take stock now and recognise that in capitulating to the views of the far right he is not just selling out the Australian people but selling his soul, and the Australian people know a sellout when they see one.</span>

To hear him stand there talking about principle, after he stood as a Liberal candidate and was elected by the people of South Australia as a Liberal candidate, is a joke. I feel sorry for the 330,000 people in South Australia who voted Liberal. They voted with him on the top of the Senate ticket. They voted for a Liberal senator for six years. Below the line, Senator Bernardi got something like 2,000 votes, and yet he stands up here and talks about principle.</span>

They should then go to the people and stand and say, 'This is who I am. This is what I stand for now' and stand for re-election. Unfortunately, of course, in the Senate you cannot do that and that is not the best democratic way to do things.</span>

They echo and reinforce Senator Bernardi's comments insofar as they were directed to the political elites and the political establishment—the political class. The people of Australia, and we see the people of America and the people of Britain, are tired of the ruling class. I see Senator Bernardi's call as yet another call to listen to the people and to serve the people, because the people have disrespect, disregard and no loyalty to the way this chamber behaves. I echo Senator Bernardi's call to the elites and the establishment to start returning to serving the people of our states and our Commonwealth.</span>

              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Sadly, it has come to pass, and the time is right for this chamber to at least have a debate on the future of the US alliance. Over the last 2½ weeks, we have seen that, rather than be tempered by those around him, he has ramped up his rhetoric. He has surrounded himself with key advisers who live in a world of fantasy and believe in a global war between the Judeo-Christian West and jihadist Islamic fascism. This is the world that Donald Trump now occupies, and this is the world that Australia is being drawn into. From the moment of his inauguration, he has sought to divide people—to use fear and division to turn people against each other. This is a man who is unleashing a wave of Islamophobia right across the world, and Australia is not immune to his hatred. We are talking about someone who, in the first few days of office, has suggested that the US send Army troops over the southern border, into Mexico, and whose administration has dangerously upped its rhetoric against China, again goading China further into conflict over the South China Sea. He has done much more. He has gagged scientists in the Environmental Protection Agency because he does not like what they have to say—what the science says on global warming. The list goes on and on and on. The bottom line is that a Trump presidency has dangerous consequences in Australia, and they are especially dangerous because we have in the US alliance a one-way relationship with that nation that is a millstone around our neck and endangers the lives of Australian people and people right across the world.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Again you have to ask yourself: what has our Prime Minister done? The coalition, and indeed the Labor Party, have sat on the sidelines, but particularly this Prime Minister, who has so utterly and completely abandoned the values that he once held that he cannot bring himself to do what any other civilised leader has done: to pick up the phone and say, 'You cannot, as somebody who espouses values of democracy and freedom, prevent people from coming to your country on the basis of their race and religion.' Just today we have seen the Speaker of the British parliament refuse to give Donald Trump an audience in that parliament, yet here in Australia it is all the way with Donald Trump.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I look at those opposite. I see the sycophants and the toadies, within both the government and, indeed, the opposition—the doormats over there who are lickspittles and sycophants to the US and refuse to stand up and say, 'This is a relationship that needs to be renegotiated because it is no longer in our national interest.' Now is not the time for appeasement. Now is the time for this country to take a stand. The Greens have long argued, well before the election of President Trump, that we need to review the US alliance, but there has been no more important time to do it than since the election of this dangerous, unhinged, divisive and hateful President. It is time we had this debate in this parliament.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Queensland</span>—<span class="HPS-MinisterialTitles">Minister for Resources and Northern Australia</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">13:12</span>):  Well, it is the first day back at school, and we already have the people down the back of the room disrupting class, as they always do. It did not take them very long. For the first item of business, they decided, 'We don't need to discuss the important issues that face our country and the people here in our nation—the issues that they are concerned about.' People are concerned about their jobs in Gladstone; they are facing losses because of high electricity prices. People just want to be able to look after their families and run their businesses. We are not debating these issues, because the Greens want to distract attention from our nation's parliament and discuss another country's issues and problems. Well, Senator Di Natale, we have been elected to the Australian parliament. We have been elected by our various states to look after their interests in the furtherance of the goals and objectives of the Commonwealth of Australia, not the United States of America, and I take my job pretty seriously. We are put here to look after the people in this country and to further their interests, not to be distracted by different issues that are happening on the other side of the planet, in another country.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The matters that face the United States of America are matters for them. Yes, we have a long, strong and enduring relationship with the United States of America, but that relationship should be strong enough and mature enough to be able to respect the democratic results of an election that they have had recently. We might not agree with that election. We might not agree with who has been elected, but that is a matter for them. If you want to be involved in American politics, do not be elected to the Australian parliament. Do something else with your life. If that is your desire in life, you can go and get a job at the United States Studies Centre in the University of Sydney, Senator Di Natale. Go do that with your life rather than be here, because when you are here you should turn up to work and do your job, not someone else's job, and our job is to look after the interests of Australians. For me, it is to look after the interests of Queenslanders in particular.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I must say that, while I have been at home a lot over the last couple of months, and it has been nice to be at home a little bit more often, people around where I am are not all that concerned or worried about what is happening in America; they are worried about what is happening here in this country. People in Central Queensland, where I am from, want us to focus on delivering for them. They want us to focus on ensuring that they have a stronger economy in Central Queensland. They want us to focus on getting things moving so that small businesses can stay alive. They want us to focus on allowing people to have a job so that their kids can have a job and they can pay their kids' school fees as they all go back to school this year. My son is starting high school—that takes more money, right? You need a job to do that. You need an income, and that is something the Greens completely ignore. They think we have the luxury in this country of going off on flights of fancy to have philosophical debates about the presidency of another country and about the laws of another country when, in fact, we have enough issues right here right now to be debating in this place, and we should focus on them.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I am here because I am waiting to be able to move a bill and put forward a bill on the Offshore Petroleum and Greenhouse Gas Storage Act. Yes, for some, it might put you to sleep, but it is actually really important to develop our gas resources off the North West Shelf in Western Australia, and this bill is very important in allowing that to happen. But, because of the behaviour of the Greens—because of their distractions—we are not allowed to debate the development of our country and development of our resources. Instead, we are distracted here talking about a suspension of standing orders which has nothing to do with our country and which will not improve the lot of one person in this country. Instead, we are being distracted by a philosophical debate that serves the Greens' interests, not our nation's interests.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The government will be opposing the suspension of standing orders because we want to get back to the business of this nation. We want to get back to helping Australians improve their lives, and we are not going to be distracted by the tactics of the Greens which, unfortunately, have started off on this very first day of parliament. I hope it is not a sign of how they will conduct themselves throughout this year—I am not holding my breath though. Let's get back to the business that people have put us here for and focus on their lives, not the distractions that might suit us from time to time.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Queensland</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">13:16</span>):  As a servant to the people of Queensland and Australia, I want to comment on Senator Di Natale's motion. But first, I want to echo Senator Canavan's comments, because it is our duty to work for the people of our state and our country. I want to compliment Senator Canavan for having the courage to reverse Liberal Party policy with regard to the use of coal. That policy shows that the climate change fraud is unravelling. In the United States, we see whistleblowers now coming out and proclaiming that the very material that the ALP and the Greens are basing their campaigns on is shown to be completely corrupt. Donald Trump, as President of the United States, is reinserting freedom into his country. We welcome whistleblowers, and we welcome his challenge to the political class that continues to ignore the people. We have seen it in the presidential elections in America, we have seen it in Britain's exit from the EU and we have seen it in our own changes in this country. The political class is ignoring the people, and Senator Di Natale is continuing to show his arrogance to the people of this country.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The President of the United States was elected by the people in accordance with the constitution of the United States—the world's largest democracy. In his oath of office, he said that his No. 1 duty is to uphold the constitution of that democracy—that great democracy, that wonderful democracy and that birthplace of freedom. The Greens have a tragic history of destroying and undermining our Constitution. The Constitution is our senior governing document. Are the Greens afraid of freedom or are they arrogant? Are they afraid of the people or arrogant towards the people?</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">A poll recently showed that the number of people in Australia supporting a ban on Islamic immigration is close to half the population. A poll last year by a left-leaning organisation showed that 34 per cent of Greens voters support a ban on Islamic immigration. What was the Greens' response to that? They said, 'We haven't done enough to educate them.' They did not say, 'We better go out and listen.' They said, 'We haven't done enough talking.' Instead of speaking to sell, the Greens need to listen to learn. I will say it again: instead of speaking to sell, the Greens need to listen to learn. They talk about a President being unhinged. Well, he has acted faster than any President in recent history. He has done what he has promised, and he has fulfilled his promises. He even started before he was inaugurated. He is now working at the speed of business instead of working at the speed of the political class. That, according to the Greens, is unhinged. Maybe the Greens cannot accept a politician keeping his promises?</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">As I see it, the President of the United States has three fundamental duties: to protect life, to protect property and to protect freedom. There is nothing more fundamental, and Donald Trump as President of the United States is serving notice on the world that the political class's days are ending. This raises the question: are the Greens worried about freedom coming back in parliaments and congresses around the world? I ask that because I support the President of the United States restoring freedom.</span>

To come in here with five minutes notice, really, to senators and without any motion before us to debate something as fundamental to Australia's past, present and future as the US-Australia alliance I think demonstrates a lack of seriousness from the Greens. There are other mechanisms in this chamber available to senators to pursue this in a serious way. For example, there are opportunities through matters of public importance and there are opportunities through general business. If we take the MPI as an example, which the Greens were successful in winning today, it could have been used—a full 60 minutes—to have the discussion that Senator Di Natale seeks to have at this point in time.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I do not doubt the seriousness of the issues that the Greens are seeking to raise in this chamber, nor the importance of the Senate debating or having a view on those issues. But our concern comes from this grandstanding approach that is being utilised by the Greens in this instance this afternoon. I think it takes away from what I genuinely believe is the seriousness of some of the issues raised by Trump's administration in the past two weeks or so.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I will just make a couple of comments about the US-Australia relationship. It is one that has endured over many decades and under governments from both major parties in both countries, and it will continue to do so. The Australian and US relationship is about values, ideals and interests, not personalities. It includes values such as democracy, freedom and justice. Australia's relationship with the United States is fundamentally important to our foreign and security policy and for our economic prosperity. A strong bilateral relationship and continued US international engagement are in Australia's interests. US engagement has been a powerful force for international stability, security and prosperity, including in the Asia-Pacific region.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">America is one of Australia's closest friends and staunchest allies and this relationship has been one of the central pillars of Australian foreign policy since the end of the Second World War and will continue to remain so. Contrary to some of the disparaging comments aimed at the Labor Party by Senator Di Natale in his comments, this will not prevent us from speaking frankly with a friend and ally when we disagree. Labor have disagreed with American policy in the past without undermining the alliance—and Iraq is a recent example of this. We have made clear that we will speak out when policies are introduced that we do not think are in Australia's best interests. We have done so already and we will continue to do so.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">However, we do not agree with this mechanism being utilised by the Greens today. It is much more about trying to get a headline than it is about genuinely discussing and responding to some of the issues that have been raised by the ascendancy of President Trump in the United States. We welcome debate on that. We welcome discussion on that. I foreshadow a motion that Senator Wong will be giving notice of today and moving tomorrow precisely to respond to some of those issues—for example and particularly around Australia's non-discriminatory immigration policy and our belief that it is a core responsibility of being a good global citizen to use appropriate diplomatic channels to encourage other countries to take the same approach. That is a serious way of getting the Senate to pass a view on some of the issues that have been raised, as opposed to coming in here without any notice and without even having before us the motion being sought to be debated.</span>

                  </a>  Senator Canavan appears to have spent the summer in some sort of alternate dimension. For the idea that what has happened in the United States will not have flow-on consequences for Australia, 'absurd' is too gentle a word. This president is not just a problem for the United States and the millions of people who are already rallying in defence of their civil rights, their human rights and the rule of law. This president is a problem for the entire world and particularly for Australia because we are one of the United States government's most subservient allies. Notwithstanding the Iraq example which Senator Gallagher correctly pointed out, under at least the Howard government Australia simply outsourced its foreign policy to the United States government and tore apart the Middle East. So President Trump is a problem for Australia.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">This is a president who has said in an offhand way, 'Maybe we should head back into Iraq and take their oil.' That places Australian service personnel in Iraq, Syria and Africa at risk. That kind of incredibly reckless offhand statement places Australians at risk. Australia participate in the Five Eyes surveillance network. We have installations such as the Pine Gap base and are involved in driftnet surveillance right across South-East Asia. We are involved in the targeting of nuclear weapons and in targeting the drone assassination program. Australia run cover in United Nations forums for US foreign policy, including the one-sided conflict between Israel and the people of Palestine. We host a US Marine Corps base in Australia, we host US aircraft bombers in northern Australia and we have facilities such as at Pine Gap and North West Cape. Our foreign and defence policy for decades has been paralysed in subservience to the United States government. The Australian Greens, as Senator Di Natale indicated, have been campaigning against that subservience for as long as we have been a political party.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">But maybe now it is starting to dawn on some of those in the Labor Party and maybe we could even dare to hope on some of those in the Liberal Party that these are not normal times. President Trump has surrounded himself with neofascists not at the fringes but at the very heart of his administration. Washington sets Australian foreign policy. Are we happy to be dragged into a war with Iran? Are we happy to be dragged into a war with China in the South China Sea? Will these decisions be made in Canberra in this parliament, or will they be made in Washington, as they were in 2003 when we were given our marching orders for an illegal invasion of Iraq? We still have ADF personnel in that part of the world trying to clean up the hideous mess that Australia created. We have hundreds of service personnel in Afghanistan still trying to hold that region together after it was torn apart by George W Bush.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The little Trumps in this parliament are the ones who we probably need to keep the closest eye on. We heard from one of them not too long ago that there are sympathisers of white supremacy in this parliament, campaigning in the Australian community for white nationalism and white supremacy. These are not normal times. This is not a normal administration. This has to be brought to a head before we are dragged into a war not of Australia's choosing.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">If this relationship is so deep and so trustworthy—and I believe in the past that it has been—then now is the time to stand up to our great and powerful ally and tell them, 'Enough is enough,' and for Australia to take its place as a middle power in the community of nations and stand up for the rule of law, human rights and an independent foreign policy. Otherwise we are going to find ourselves dragged into a situation, not of our making, but one in which everyone in this parliament would be deeply complicit. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">So, Senator Canavan, I utterly reject the idea that what happened in the United States over the summer recess of this parliament has nothing to do with Australia. For better or worse, how could you possibly bring an opinion like that into this place? I suspect that the vast majority of people who elected you to this place would seriously disagree with that. The Greens believe that we need to draw a line and bring these issues to a head using every means possible in this parliament. We do not apologise for suspending standing orders—these issues need to be brought to a head.</span>

We have a truly dangerous person in Donald Trump—with a cabal of religious, racist, warmongering, fascist fanatics gathered around him—who now controls the most powerful political office in the world. Just weeks after taking that office, President Trump has shown he is manifestly unfit to govern. His attacks on the rule of law show that the US is in danger of slipping into a state of early-onset fascism, and there is every chance that we are actually witnessing the early stages of a coup in the United States, where power is usurped—</span>

                  </a>  You should listen to this, Senator Dastyari, because power is being usurped away from the US Constitution, away from the courts and away from the states and concentrated in the hands of the Trump family in the interests of the Trump business empire and its sycophantic hangers-on who are being appointed every day into positions of power and influence in the Oval Office. It is not now an exaggeration to suggest that armed conflict is a realistic possibility during this term of the Australian government. China is pursuing expansionist policies in the South China Sea. It is beyond obvious that Putin wants to go to war and it is equally beyond obvious that Donald Trump, because of the corrupt relationships between his business and the corrupt capitalist oligarchs in Russia, is going to join Putin in escalating this crisis. These are not hypothetical or academic discussions and they are not, as Senator Canavan has laughingly attempted to argue only moments ago, things that Australia should not take an interest in.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">It is a matter of historical record that our refusal to question the US alliance can be measured in the deaths of tens of thousands of Australians and in recent times the death of thousands of Australia's service personnel in places like Vietnam, Iraq and Afghanistan. Here is the chance for this country, Australia, to act in its national interests and draw a line in the sand. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">But I will tell you what: we are not holding our breath over here in the Greens because, unfortunately, there is no chance that the Liberals are going to do that for the simple reason that they are actually political fellow travellers with Mr Trump and the hateful world view that he represents. I ask the Liberals: how can they possibly condemn President Trump for his environmental vandalism when they are basically sitting by and doing nothing to address dangerous climate change? How can they reject his immigration ban and his Islamophobia, when in fact right now, using Australia's money and in Australia's name, we have well over a thousand of the world's most desperate and vulnerable people indefinitely detained in prison camps on Manus Island and Nauru? How can the Liberals honestly condemn Donald Trump's discrimination against LGBTIQ people, while in this country they are still being denied access to the fundamental civil institution of marriage? In fact we have, as usual, political cowardice and the inability to stand up to far-right bullies. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">There is no surprise there. Rather than rejecting racism and hate, the Liberal Party is in fact embracing it and putting it in a shiny suit—and none better than the shiny suit worn by Senator Cory Bernardi. I am not going to go into the bitter irony of a proclaimed conservative Christian giving vocal support to someone who brags about sexually assaulting women and grabbing women by the pussy. But it is worth pointing out that the Liberal Party sent him to the US last year and ended up radicalising him even further. To put it another way: you guys sent Senator Bernardi to the US on a taxpayer-funded trip and all you got in return was a stupid red hat—that is all you got in return. Well, we intend to make the Liberal Party wear that hat every single day like a crown of thorns until the Liberal Party has the courage to stand— <span style="font-style:italic;">(Time expired)</span></span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">New South Wales</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">13:35</span>):  I want to begin by saying that was a fantastic speech, Senator McKim, especially the end part. On day one can we just try and restrain some of the crazy that has become this chamber. You have Senator Bernardi who is quitting a party that he runs! Who leaves a party that does whatever you want them to do? If you are already running the Liberal Party, you do not leave it. You have Senator di Natale getting up here and pulling on a ridiculous stunt—to have something as significant as looking at the entirety of the Australia-US relationship discussed in the mode of a suspension of standing orders with five minutes notice. The Senate has not been sitting for months. There has been plenty of opportunity to have a proper kind of debate. Frankly, the idea that the relationship between Australia and America is not strong enough to get past different individuals is absurd. Yes, a ban on majority Muslim countries is abhorrent to people. Yes, a lot of what is going on in the United States should and deserves to be called out when we disagree with it because we are their friends and because we are their allies. But the idea that you are going to completely restructure a relationship as part of a ridiculous stunt on the first day of the Senate—maybe it is time for a bit of left renewal. Maybe Senator di Natale believes there are people in his own party who do not think he is left-wing enough and so he takes more and more extreme positions. What I am really upset about in this debate is that I am putting myself in a position where I will be voting with Senator Roberts. That is bad from me and bad to Senator Roberts!</span>

                      <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Senator MOORE</span>
                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Queensland</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">13:46</span>):  The opposition supports the Offshore Petroleum and Greenhouse Gas Storage Amendment (Petroleum Pools and Other Measures) Bill 2016. The bill makes a number of straightforward technical amendments to the Offshore Petroleum and Greenhouse Gas Storage Act 2006. This legislation arises out of the proposed development of the Browse Basin. Oil and gas were discovered in the Browse Basin in the 1970s. However, there has not been a lot of development, due to its relative isolation and the depth of water 425 kilometres off the coast of Western Australia. In recent years, the development of resources in the Browse Basin has begun. The Ichthys field is being developed by INPEX, piping gas and condensate over 800 kilometres from the basin to Darwin for processing. The LNG processing facility in Darwin is currently under construction, and the first train is expected to be operational in September 2017.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The Woodside led Browse Joint Venture has also looked at the development of three other fields in the Browse Basin, including the Torosa field. This project has been a source of tension between the Western Australian government, the Commonwealth government and Woodside. The Torosa field straddles Commonwealth and Western Australian jurisdictions. Its maritime borders were redefined in 2014 when Geoscience Australia discovered several rocky outcrops above the field. It was concluded that these outcrops should be considered islands and therefore belong to Western Australia rather than the Commonwealth. This meant that Western Australia's share of the royalties from the Browse project rose from approximately five per cent to 65.4 per cent, and the Commonwealth government's share dropped to 34.6 per cent.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The purpose of this legislation before us is to provide protection and certainty to all parties in the event that the area contains multiple petroleum pools rather than a single pool. Currently, section 54 of the Offshore Petroleum and Greenhouse Gas Storage Act contemplates that an apportionment agreement relates only to a single petroleum pool that straddles a Commonwealth-state jurisdictional boundary. If it subsequently becomes apparent that the area specified in the apportionment agreement contains multiple petroleum pools, as may be the case when fuller technical information is obtained while this resource is being developed, then the apportionment agreement would fail. The bill also makes other amendments to the Offshore Petroleum and Greenhouse Gas Storage Act to allow the National Offshore Petroleum Safety and Environmental Management Authority to refund fees paid to it where necessary. I note that in March of last year Woodside decided to defer its Browse Joint Venture, citing low prices and high costs. That does not mean that this legislation is not important. We expect that the Browse Basin will be further developed, and that is why this amendment applies equally to existing and any future agreements. This is all about providing real investment certainty.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">In contrast, what Western Australian Nationals leader Brendon Grylls is doing at the moment is undermining investment certainty in our resources sectors. I want to spend a few minutes on this. Mr Grylls is proposing a $5-a-tonne iron ore mining tax that would apply at first instance to BHP Billiton and Rio Tinto. This is expected to generate about $3 billion a year. It is different to a profit based tax. It is based on tonnage, not profit; the amount of iron ore dug out of the ground, not how much profit a mining company makes. That means companies could conceivably have to pay it even if they were making no profit at all. Not surprisingly, it is being condemned by Rio Tinto and BHP, who would be the first companies that would have to pay this new tax. Both would have to pay an additional $1.5 billion a year. Both have said publicly that it will hit jobs and investment in Western Australia.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This proposal has also been criticised by the Premier of Western Australia, the Western Australian opposition leader—and we will probably hear them speaking a lot in the next couple of weeks—the Prime Minister, the federal Leader of the Opposition and, although it has taken him a while, last but not least the Deputy Prime Minister Barnaby Joyce. Last week he urged the WA Nationals leader to dump the plan. That earned him a bit of touch-up from Brendon Grylls, who called him a lackey from the Pyne-Xenophon government. It will be interesting to see what happens from here. It was only a few weeks ago that the Deputy Prime Minister was telling the New South Wales National Party to dump their plan to ban greyhound racing. He got his way there, and we have seen what has happened. It will be interesting to see if he can roll the Western Australian National Party as well. I hope that he succeeds sooner rather than later. What is important here—generally and in this legislation—is certainty. That is what this legislation is about: providing certainty for the oil and gas industry. It is also needed in the iron ore industry. I commend this bill to the House.</span>

                      <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Senator HANSON-YOUNG</span>
                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">South Australia</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">13:52</span>):  I rise to speak on the Offshore Petroleum and Greenhouse Gas Storage Amendment Storage Amendment (Petroleum Pools and Other Measures) Bill 2016 and foreshadow that I do have an amendment that I will seek to move in the committee stage. This bill seeks to amend the Offshore Petroleum and Greenhouse Gas Storage Act 2006 in a number of ways, including to give effect to arrangements between the Commonwealth and states relating to revenue from petroleum pools that straddle the boundaries of Commonwealth and state jurisdictions.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">It also—and this is important—retrospectively validates payments by NOPSEMA since December 2011 by making it clear that there is a regulation-making power supporting those payments. These amendments are in response to a High Court case that threw them into doubt. In other words, this is just another of the frequent bills that come into this place and pass this parliament and are aimed at keeping the offshore oil and gas industry going, giving that industry the regulations that they want and that suit them. We spend a long time in this place making sure that big oil and fossil fuel companies get exactly the regulatory settings they ask for, and this bill is no exception.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The campaign to protect the Great Australian Bight in my home state of South Australia is one that has galvanised our local communities. It is a campaign based on wanting to protect our precious marine life, protect that precious ecosystem and ensure that drilling for oil by massive multinationals does not occur. But we know that, because of the lack of courage and spine from both the state Labor government and the federal Labor and Liberal parties, big multinational oil companies like Chevron continue to put pressure on our parliamentarians to get access to the Great Australian Bight so that they can drill for oil.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Now, there is an argument that this is all about generating jobs in South Australia. Well, we know that is false. We know that is not true. Even when BP, as recently as last year, put forward applications to drill for all, it became clear that they had no intention of employing South Australians or indeed any Australians at all in these oil-drilling operations. Most of the jobs would be kept for specialists who would be flown in from overseas. But of course local jobs in the area would be put at extreme risk—the tourism industry in South Australia and the fishing industry in South Australia, all at risk if companies like BP or, now, as we have heard, Chevron, get their way and are able to start drilling for oil in the Great Australian Bight.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Well, it is time that this parliament started standing up for these precious marine areas. Where these big multinational oil companies want to drill is right smack bang in the middle of a whale sanctuary—smack bang in the middle of an area that is meant to be a Commonwealth marine park protecting our fishing industries and protecting our tourism industry. But all of that would be put at risk if big oil, big multinational companies like Chevron, got their way. It is time that this parliament started to stand by the previous obligations of the Commonwealth Marine Park, an area that is meant to be protected, and do something to ensure that this national treasure is kept free of a disaster such as what we saw in the Gulf of Mexico. The Gulf of Mexico has been devastated—marine life killed, local jobs devastated—because of BP's oil mess there.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Chevron wants to put our spectacular marine park at risk, and if they are given approval there will be several other companies lining up behind them. What is the point of having a marine protected area, a Commonwealth marine park, if you are just going to let big oil come in and drill willy-nilly? The bight is an essential sanctuary for our southern right whales and a feeding ground for threatened sea lions, sharks, tuna and migratory sperm whales we cannot afford to put that at risk. South Australians do not support opening up the Great Australian Bight to big foreign oil companies, and it is time this parliament stood up for the area and for our local communities. That is why, when we get to the committee stage of this bill, I will be moving an amendment to say that we cannot allow the drilling of oil to occur in what is meant to be a marine protected area, a Commonwealth marine park, a whale sanctuary. It is too precious to put at risk. Our tourism jobs in South Australia, our fishing jobs in South Australia are too precious and too important to our state's economy to be put at risk so that a foreign oil company can rack up some more profit. We know that the South Australian community will miss out. It is time that South Australian MPs and senators in this place do the right thing and tell big oil to bugger off.</span>

I will also be commenting on the enormous value of Chevron extending its environmental responsibility, which you have seen evidenced in abundance on Barrow Island—offshore Western Australia—to the Great Australian Bight.</span>

It is as clear as anything could be that there is only one side of Australian politics with any plan for Australia's future prosperity, and that is this side of politics; that is the Turnbull government. Senator Wong asks about the state of the economy. Let me remind Senator Wong that Australia's annual economic growth rate is now 1.8 per cent. That is faster than five of the G7 countries. Non-mining activity grew by 2.64 per cent over the year to September. When Mr Bowen was Treasurer in the Labor government, he left us with growth of 1.78 per cent in non-mining activity. That is the magnitude of the ramp-up under this government.  </span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Senator Wong asks about unemployment. Unemployment is currently 5.8 per cent. Over half a million additional jobs have been created since September 2013, when the government was elected. There were 95,000 additional full-time jobs created in the last quarter of last year—95,000 additional full-time jobs. Jobs growth in the last quarter of 2016 was the strongest quarterly growth in jobs in six years. That is the fruit of this government's economic policies. Compare that to the position under the Labor government, when the number of unemployed increased by 43.9 per cent over the six years of the Labor government. The number of underemployed workers increased by 39 per cent under the six years of the Labor government.</span>

Under this government, employment grew by 0.9 per cent over the calendar year 2016, and, since the government came to office, 519,300 jobs have been created, with employment standing at a record high today of 11,985,900. That is the story of the labour market under this government. By comparison, the only plan that the Labor Party has under Mr Shorten is for job losses. <span style="font-style:italic;">(Time expired)</span></span>

We know what the Labor Party's position in relation to jobs is. It is to have fewer jobs and a poorer people, because the Labor Party, by standing in the way of the government's enterprise tax plan, will make it harder for businesses to expand and create new jobs. The Labor Party, by driving up the price of electricity, in particular, will make it harder to do business, harder for businesses to grow and employ more people and harder for poorer people to afford their fuel bills. That is what the Labor Party wants. This is the Labor Party, every one of whose senators is here at the behest of and as the hireling of trade union officials, who are not interested in creating new jobs, but in protecting the position of the officials— <span style="font-style:italic;">(Time expired)</span></span>

I am pleased to advise Senator Hume and the Senate that the government's commitment is to ensure that we do everything we can to help ensure that families across Australia have the best possible opportunity to get ahead, that the economy is as strong as possible, that as many jobs as possible can be created in the economy and that Australians today and future generations of Australians have the best possible opportunity to get a good, well-paid job and to get ahead. Unlike the current Leader of the Labor Party, who seems to think that jobs grow on trees, on this side of the chamber we understand that jobs are created by successful, profitable businesses. </span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">The more successful, the more profitable, businesses across Australia can be, the more Australians they can hire and the better wages they can afford to pay. That is why this government's strategy is to make it easier for businesses across Australia to be successful—by lowering their tax burden so they can attract more investment, improve productivity, become more profitable and hire more Australians and pay them better wages, by improving access to key markets around the world and through an ambitious free trade agenda, by reducing the cost of doing business through a deregulation and innovation agenda, and by reducing the cost of doing business by putting downward pressure on electricity prices. It is important to remember that Australia is in its 26th year of continuous growth. Jobs growth, as the Leader of the Government has been saying, has been running very strongly compared to what it was under the Labor Party in government. Indeed, over the most recent 12-month period more than four times as many jobs have been created across Australia than in the last four years of the Labor government.

That is because a more competitive business tax rate will help us attract more investment, will help us improve productivity and will help businesses across Australia hire more Australians, and that will help businesses pay better wages. The reality is that 15 years ago Australia had the ninth-lowest corporate tax rate among advanced economies, but we are falling behind. Today, just five of 35 OECD nations have a corporate tax rate higher than ours, and of course we know that the Trump administration in the United States is about to reduce the corporate tax rate in the United States from 35 to 15 per cent. If we want to be able to attract investment into Australia, if we want to be able to attract capital to grow the economy, we need to be competitive. <span style="font-style:italic;">(Time expired)</span></span>

The leader of the Labor Party—the current leader, I should say—said in his speech to the Press Club that his priority this year would be jobs, jobs, jobs, and then he proceeds to announce one job-killing policy after another. Every single one of the policies under the Bill Shorten Labor Party is designed to kill jobs. He wants higher taxes for business, making it harder for business to be successful, meaning fewer jobs and higher unemployment. He is against trade. He wants to push up the cost of electricity for businesses across Australia, making it harder for them to be successful. The thing Mr Shorten needs to understand is that jobs do not grow on trees—if you genuinely want more jobs created, join the coalition in helping businesses across Australia to be more successful so they can hire more Australians and pay them better wages.</span>

I refer to an article published in the <span style="font-style:italic;">Australian Financial Review</span> on 24 January titled 'Accepting industries will die: Sinodinos' in which the minister urged Australians not to be too nostalgic about dying industries, saying, 'nothing is forever.' Minister, is this the best advice you can give the 200,000 Australians whose jobs depend upon the automotive industry but who now face such an uncertain future?</span>

I was talking about the natural process in the economy where over time some industries will thrive and others will start to contract, and the role of government is to manage the transition. Where there is a role for government to assist growth in jobs and industry, we will do that on my watch. In my press release on my appointment I talked about the fact that, for example, I see a real future for high-value manufacturing in Australia. I am proud to report that manufacturing employment was 957,000 in the November quarter of 2016—an increase of 90,900 jobs, or 10.5 per cent, from the August quarter, and averaging 902,000 over the year, after employing 868,000 people in November 2015. So manufacturing is not dying in this country—quite the reverse; it is getting better and it is going to become more high-value. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We are going to have more advanced manufacturing, including in the automotive sector, where the transition is occurring. We are focusing on more high-value activities. The sorts of activities we are talking about include engineering research and development—all the high-value activities which will then contribute to our role in the automotive supply chains which today are global supply chains. You have to recognise that the assembly of cars is only one component of the industry, and the high-value components increasingly are in engineering research and development. Ford, Holden and other car companies are focusing and concentrating their activities in countries like Australia on that high-value end because they know the potential we have in that sector and the research forces we can bring to bear.</span>

I remember in 2013 Toyota announced that it would be closing in Australia. Regrettably, last week we had confirmation that that will occur in October of this year. The decline of manufacturing in the automotive sector in this country was something overseen by the Labor Party. It went too far for us to be able to reverse it, so what we are doing is easing the transition into an import sales model with more focus on research and development.</span>

It is good to see you back after your period of illness late last year. The Prime Minister is not of that view. As I have said many times, and the Prime Minister and the foreign minister have said many times as well, the Australian government will work with any American administration. There may be points of difference—there have been, historically. Nevertheless, it is in Australia's interests that the Australian government work with any American administration, and we do. </span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">As you know, the Prime Minister has spoken to President Trump on two occasions. On the second of those occasions that week a difference was resolved, when Mr Turnbull, as you would expect of an Australian Prime Minister, stood up for Australia's interests. The foreign minister has spoken as recently as this morning to Secretary Tillerson, the new Secretary of State, and on several occasions to Vice President Pence. On Saturday morning I spoke to the Homeland Security Advisor, Mr Bossert, and other members of the cabinet have spoken to their interlocutors in the Trump administration. That is the way Australia does business, as you know, and it is very much in our national interest that, allowing for the fact that there may be differences from time to time, we have a cooperative and cordial relationship with the United States, and we will.</span>

On a number of occasions Prime Minister Turnbull has referred to Australia as having shared values to those of the United States. On behalf of the Australian Greens I seek some clarification of these shared values. Is he referring to President Donald Trump's intention to reintroduce torture, provoking a new nuclear weapons arms race, deliberate escalation of tensions with Iran, threats of a war in the South China Sea, the invasion of Mexico, the banning of Muslims from entering the United States, contempt for the rule of law and his weird admiration for authoritarian regimes?</span>

You may question the policies or attitudes of any particular American president from time to time. You are at liberty to do so. But let us never forget the great historical context and sweep. America is the greatest liberal democracy the world has ever seen. Australia is a great liberal democracy. Those are the values we share, which will endure down the ages.</span>

I can confirm today that Defence will only be purchasing land from willing sellers in the vicinity of the Shoalwater Bay Training Area and the Townsville Field Training Area in support of the military training agreement with Singapore. I have received initial advice from Defence on its master planning and have heard the concerns of local landowners, which have been expressed to me directly, and have been able to remove the question of forced sales from the master planning process. </span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">Defence will continue to talk to landowners around the two training areas who are interested in selling as willing vendors, and officials will continue to engage with local communities while that master planning process and the socioeconomic impact study are finalised. Following my third visit to Rockhampton a fortnight ago and subsequent discussions, those significant concerns of the community were of course raised with me, and today's decision will go a significant distance to address those concerns. Any land that is purchased by willing sellers will, of course, be owned by the Australian government, and the Australian Defence Force will maintain its priority use and access. Those who are peddling misinformation about this might want to note that. Under the military training agreement there will be significant benefits to both the Rockhampton and Townsville regions as well as, importantly, to the Australian Defence Force.</span>

Community and stakeholder consultation will continue to be a part of Defence's approach to this work as the master planning process continues and as properties come onto the market and as willing vendors make contact with and negotiate with Defence. </span>

It has been a great pleasure to work with the very hardworking—in fact, I think she is described as 'the feisty federal MP for Capricornia'—Michelle Landry in this regard. I visited Rockhampton three, perhaps four, times in recent months as part of the engagement on the comprehensive strategic partnership and the military training initiative. That is in stark contrast to those opposite who have no interest in the potential for economic development that the CSP provides. It is in stark contrast to—</span>

                  </a>  Yes. The point of order is on relevance. There are two questions: when was the minister advised the Prime Minister had made this pledge, and when was she made aware that Ms Landry would issue the public statement?</span>

I can confirm for those opposite that I have enjoyed the opportunity, as I said at the beginning of my answer, to work very closely with the member for Capricornia and the member for Flynn on these issues and indeed with the Deputy Prime Minister and with the Prime Minister. This is an important announcement today, because it enables Defence to continue with the master planning process. The work that was done in consultation following my last visit to Rockhampton, which was two weeks ago as I said, and the Deputy Prime Minister's visit on Friday to meet with local representatives, which is also important feedback, and I had met with some of the same people, has resulted in today's announcement. It enables Defence to continue with the master planning process and it enables the development to be progressed as it should be. </span>

It is disappointing that those opposite have no concept of the planning process that needs to be undertaken in a significant agreement such as this. There has been an initial planning process, which started in November or so last year. There was extensive communication and consultation with members of the local community about that planning process. And I announced a fortnight ago that, given there were significant community concerns, I would curtail the length of the master planning process and ensure that it finished within a month. I also indicated that I would ensure that agricultural land was, as far as possible, used for agricultural purposes. What those opposite do not understand—and it is hardly surprising, given their experience—is that a plan of this significance, a strategic partnership of this significance, takes a very long time to plan and to organise. There are certain legislative requirements and there are certain environmental requirements—in fact, the list goes on. We have been observing all of those in making the announcement today. <span style="font-style:italic;">(Time expired)</span></span>

We are a strong supporter of the thousands of Australians who work in coal. We are a strong supporter of coal jobs. We back coal jobs, we back the wealth that they create and we back the ability of those jobs to help people own their own homes, put their kids into school and live a good and decent life as Australians. It is an incredibly important sector. </span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">Often we think about the coal sector in this country as the exports that we provide to the rest of the world, and it is true that around 90 per cent of the coal we produce is exported to other countries. It provides those countries with a low-cost source of power and an ability to make steel, but, of course, it is still an essential part of our own energy mix. It accounts for just over 60 per cent of our electricity sources in this country. On the eastern seaboard, in the National Electricity Market, more than 70 per cent of our electricity is generated by coal. We need coal to keep the lights on in this country. We need coal to make sure that we can provide cheap, affordable and reliable power to our manufacturing sector, for those manufacturing jobs that Senator Carr so eloquently tries to defend. We need coal to help those jobs.</span>

                  </a>  We need coal, and that is why this government is backing coal: so that we back jobs in this country. If you want to back jobs in Australia, you have to back our coal sector. If you want to back jobs in manufacturing, you have to back coal—there is no other way we can have it. Our coal industry can contribute to our goals to be cleaner and more environmentally sustainable. The latest and most advanced forms of coal-fired power can bring down emissions by up to 30 per cent. If we replaced our entire coal fleet with these facilities, they would bring down emissions by up to 27 per cent in the coal sector. They are part of our solution, they are part of our energy mix, and this government supports them. <span style="font-style:italic;">(Time expired)</span></span>

The latest coal-fired power technologies are making advances and are being rolled out right across our world—most especially in our region. We often say that we are part of the Asia-Pacific region. Well, if we are truly part of it, we should be making sure we look in our region to what solutions are being found there. Across the world there are more than 700 high-efficiency, low-emissions coal-fired power plants.</span>

                  </a>  There are a huge number of coal-fired power plants—there are more than 200 being constructed right now in the world. This represents more than 100 Hazelwood coal-fired power stations. We have all heard about Hazelwood and its importance; more than 100 of them are being built right across the world. This shows that the world is still looking to coal for a cheap and affordable source of power. It is something we should also consider as part of our energy mix, and it is a good thing that the world is doing this, because it is such an important part of our economy and our prosperity in this country.</span>

                  </a>  Thank you, Mr President. As I was saying, our coal industry contributes $34 billion in exports to our economy. It is the second largest export in our country, and, while those exports are very important, we should also seek to consider to use those resources in our nation to create good, high-paying jobs for Australians. Coal does not get clean on the boat. If it is clean to be used overseas, it is clean to be used here, and we should be taking advantage of that resource to develop our industry and our manufacturing sector. As we develop the coal resources of the Galilee Basin, they amount to an enormous opportunity to build on the strong metals manufacturing industry we have in North Queensland. We have the minerals and the low-cost energy sources and we should be smart enough as a nation to harness them to create jobs for Australians.</span>

To directly answer her question: no, I do not agree that would be the case, because that would only create further disruption and further uncertainty around energy investment in Australia. The matter of the renewable energy target was settled in this parliament around 18 months ago. At that time the coalition government took action to bring it to a level of generation that was closer to the 20 per cent target that had initially been set. It will need about 23 per cent under current projections. So we brought down the actual level of generation that had to be made to meet that target. In doing so, it provided a more achievable, certain environment for energy generation in Australia, which of course means that that keeps price pressures down to some point.</span>

They went off to the last election with a target of 50 per cent by 2030. But, of course, there was absolutely no detail of how that would be achieved, let alone any detail of how much it would cost, let alone any detail of what the flow-through impact would be in terms of the reliability of the electricity market or in terms of the cost to consumers. Just last weekend, Mr Butler, the shadow minister for the Labor Party, was asked whether they still stood by their 50 per cent target. And, of course, he had absolutely no answer to that whatsoever. There was no clarity as to whether this target remains Labor Party policy. We are certainly committed to making sure that—</span>

As I outlined in answer to the initial question, I do not agree that there would be a $3 billion saving that passed through to Australian business because the reality is we would create significant investment uncertainty through further changes to a target that was only set 18 months ago and only runs until 2020.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">So far from seeing a significant saving for business and a significant generation of new jobs in those circumstances, it is quite likely that we would see the opposite from those types of policies being implemented. But I do absolutely agree that, if you were to go and set further, higher, ill-thought through, unjustified targets for the future, it would absolutely have a devastating impact on jobs, costs, prices for Australians. And that is why we flatly reject the policies of the Labor Party in this regard.</span>

But I can tell you, Senator, in relation to the issue that you raise that, while Australia has a generous, targeted and fair welfare system, Australians rightly expect that support should only be provided to those who need it. Everybody who relies on the welfare system are entitled to what their entitlements prescribe—nothing more and nothing less. Senator Cameron, if we are going to have a fair and generous welfare system in this country there has to be a system that ensures that there is not overpayment and that where there is overpayment that overpayment is recouped.</span>

Where the Department of Health and Social Services have found a discrepancy between what that person told Centrelink that they earnt and information matched against the ATO—so if there is, evidently, a discrepancy between what the relevant person declared to Centrelink and what they declared in their return to the ATO—that data is matched. In the event that there is a discrepancy, the person concerned is asked to explain it. That is, Senator Cameron, a perfectly sensible way of identifying apparent discrepancies while at the same time—</span>

I do not agree, because the fact is that all should acknowledge that if we are to have a First World, generous social welfare system forming a safety net so that the people who need it most get it most then we have to ensure that every dollar of transfer payments paid through the social security system goes to the people who are entitled to them, and not a penny more. Not a penny less, but not a penny more. When there is evidently a discrepancy from the two primary sources of information in relation to a recipient's income—that is, what they lodge with the ATO and what they lodge with Centrelink—then of course once an apparent discrepancy is discovered, it ought to be interrogated. <span style="font-style:italic;">(Time expired)</span></span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">South Australia</span>—<span class="HPS-MinisterialTitles">Minister for Education and Training</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">14:48</span>):  I thank Senator Paterson, a fierce advocate for energy security and market efficiency, for his question. Mr President, through you to Senator Paterson, the retirement of Hazelwood will lead to higher wholesale electricity costs. The Australian Energy Market Commission estimates this closure will increase household costs across the national electricity market by $78. In my home state of South Australia, prices are expected to rise by $150 as a result of this. The closure of Hazelwood could also further worsen energy security in South Australia, because in 2015-16 Victoria provided some 14 per cent of South Australia's operational consumption.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">After Hazelwood closes in March of this year, Victoria will be inhibited not only from its own production efficiently for its state but also from helping South Australia manage peak demands over the summer as Victoria potentially becomes an importer of power itself. This is a risk that South Australia can ill afford, having experienced a statewide blackout on 28 September affecting some 1.7 million people, many for several days. There was a further blackout on 1 December affecting 200,000 customers, and further subsequent to that.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">
                  <span style="font-style:italic;" />The closure of Hazelwood will make Australia more reliant on intermittent powers as well, which poses two significant challenges for energy security. One of the challenges is it does not generate electricity consistently. Of course, wind and renewables vary in their generation. Wind, for example, in South Australia supplied up to 80 per cent of demand on one day last year and less than one per cent on another. Equally, unlike hydro gas or coal, intermittent energy does not generate a consistent quality of generation. All of these factors create problems for the reliability as well as the affordability of the market—problems we as a nation must honestly confront to have energy security in the future. <span style="font-style:italic;">(Time expired)</span></span>

There are real risks. There are risks from different state and territory governments as states like South Australia, Victoria and Queensland—Labor state governments—pursue erratic, poorly considered renewable energy targets of their own as the alternative government in Australia pursues an equally erratic and poorly considered renewable energy target of some 50 per cent, with no costings and no plans.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">We do know that Bloomberg New Energy Finance estimated that Labor's plan would cost $48 billion. That is $2,000 for every man, woman and child in Australia or around $5,000 per household. The Grattan Institute estimated Labor's plan would require some 10,000 new wind turbines over the decade. We can see real risks, of course, with the costs, as well as those risks on whether it actually contributes to a secure, stable and reliable energy market, which clearly their policies do not.</span>

In the wake of the South Australian blackout, which was estimated to cost some $367 million in lost economic activity and the like, the Commonwealth called an extraordinary meeting of the COAG Energy Council and got agreement to the expert Finkel review that is being undertaken. We also got agreement to a range of emergency measures, including requiring two gas-generating units to be on at all times, constraining the Heywood interconnector at certain times and stricter controls in relation to wind farms.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">But unfortunately these measures which might improve reliability come at additional cost, so we are dead keen to make sure we work on measures to drive down costs in the future as well. That is why we have an agreement to abolish the limited merits review process. It will save consumers money. There is already in New South Wales a threat to a $300 reduction in household bills as a result of the gaming of that by some electricity networks. There is also our reform to improve— <span style="font-style:italic;">(Time expired)</span></span>

Two weeks later Centrelink admitted they got it wrong and reinstated Anne's pension. Why is the government continuing to harass pensioners instead of correcting its debt recovery mess?</span>

I am aware of the general circumstances, however. I am also aware of the background to this data-matching program. The data-matching program, I am advised, commenced in 1990 when former senator Graham Richardson put the act through parliament that undertook this. The automated data-matching program commenced when the current Leader of the Opposition and Deputy Leader of the Opposition in the other place were ministers in the previous Labor government. It is important, despite the hysteria that the Labor Party have attempted to whip up on this, that the public know that the automated data-matching program that is in place at the moment was first implemented, I am advised, by the Leader of the Opposition and the Deputy Leader of the Opposition in the other place when they were ministers in the previous Labor government.</span>

Let us go to facts that became clear when people in instances provided by the Labor Party were found to owe debts to the Commonwealth. Instances that were provided by the shadow minister were found to relate to people who owed funds to the Commonwealth. Unless the Labor Party are repudiating the automated data-matching program that began under Mr Shorten and Ms Plibersek, which I do not think they are, they are basically saying that we should not be pursuing inconsistency in data provided by payment recipients and taxpayers. Are they saying we should not be pursuing overpayments in the interests of Australian taxpayers? I think Australian taxpayers and citizens would profoundly disagree with that.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">In November last year, along with the Minister for Women, Senator Cash, I was very pleased to announce the employment of Julie Inman Grant as the new Children's eSafety Commissioner. As colleagues would probably recall, that office was established in 2015 and operates an online cyberbullying complaints system, which has seen the commissioner and her predecessor work with large social media services to remove harmful cyberbullying material which is targeted at Australian children. </span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Research that has been conducted by the government disturbingly found that over a 12-month period as many as one in five Australian children aged between eight and 17 have experienced cyberbullying. I should also advise colleagues that the government has provided $7½ million in funding for the delivery of online safety education programs in schools. The government has also announced that it will introduce a bill this year to expand the general functions of the Children's eSafety Commissioner from online safety for children to online safety for all Australians. This really recognises the expanded role that the office has assumed over time, particularly in relation to issues of women's safety and domestic abuse being promulgated on online platforms. As a result, we will be renaming the office as the online eSafety Commissioner— <span style="font-style:italic;">(Time expired)</span></span>

At the time of the announcement of Ms Inman-Grant's appointment, we said that the commissioner would take the lead in combating nonconsensual sharing of intimate images. The government, I should also advise, is conducting a public consultation process on a proposed civil penalties regime, targeted at both the perpetrators and sites which host intimate images and video shared without consent. That will be released in the coming months. In parallel, the government has also allocated $4.8 million to the office to develop a national online reporting tool, and that will allow victims to report cases of nonconsensual sharing of intimate images and to access immediate support.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Victoria</span>—<span class="HPS-MinisterialTitles">Manager of Government Business in the Senate, Minister for Communications and Minister for the Arts</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">15:02</span>):  I can. The office has resolved more than 330 serious cyberbullying complaints. It has conducted over 11,800 investigations into illegal or offensive online content. It has educated more than 163,000 people via virtual classrooms and face-to-face presentations. It has launched its youth-focused initiative, Rewrite Your Story, to raise awareness about cyberbullying and the reporting function the office has. The office has also launched the eSafety Women's site with resources and advice for women and has provided training for more than 1200 front-line professionals across every state and territory to help women who experience technology-facilitated abuse. I think it is an important development that we are expanding the role and remit of the office, not only the soft functions but also the hard functions, which include looking at a new civil penalties regime.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">I acknowledge Senator Birmingham's comments and particularly the fact that he is here in a representing capacity and so it is unlikely that he would have the brief on his desk. Nonetheless, the Minister for the Environment and Energy has had a brief on his desk for months, you assume. The questions that I put on 2 November relate to the disastrous Roe Highway. I was going to call it 'a proposal', but since we were here late last year the damage is now well under way. This project is being rammed through the Beeliar Wetlands. More than a hundred hectares of priceless and precious banksia woodland is being bowled over even as we speak.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The questions I put to the Minister for the Environment and Energy, Minister Frydenberg, relate to the approval of the Roe 8 and in particular how the environment minister decided upon the criminally abject offsets condition—I will talk a little bit more about offsets in a moment—and whether the core surveys of endangered Carnaby's Cockatoos were conducted or even completed. As I speak, 300-year-old tuart trees are being cleared, as are banksia trees and paper barks in an area of woodland incredibly precious and rare. While this disastrous project is still being assessed, it was declared to be a federally-listed threatened ecological community. So while we wait for the wheels of bureaucracy to slowly turn and while we wait for a flicker of interest from the Commonwealth government, irreplaceable urban bushland is being torn apart and pushed into piles.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I want to pay my respects to everyone who has shown up in defence of this incredibly precious place and conducted respectful and determined nonviolent direct action. When legal processes fail, when processes of governance fail, when processes of allocation of scarce taxpayers' resources fail, it is often the last resort of ordinary members of the community to step up in protection of their backyard. There have been many arrests on site. For the most part, relations between community members who have put themselves on the line and the police have been respectful. But, I should say, all of this could have been avoided.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">This process has been a debacle from the start. Since construction began in December, with three court cases at a state and federal level still pending, the community has been bearing witness to clearing and construction practices that have been in breach of many of the ministerial conditions that these questions go to. These have been reported to the minister. The minister did me the courtesy of taking a phone call even though he was on leave earlier this year—I appreciated that—and made some of his advisers available. When it came to the conversation, we were paid the courtesy of the conversation. When it comes to action or anything at all actually being done to change the practices on the ground, nothing, zero impact. Asbestos has been uncovered. Dust suppression has been almost non-existent. Native fauna management borders on the criminally negligent, with the trapping and removal of endangered southern brown bandicoots occurring as little as 90 minutes before bulldozers move in to tear the place apart.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">My question went directly to the issue of the status of the management plans. We will continue to raise these issues of noncompliance, but the government should be aware that these powerful community-led actions will continue until some sense is coming from this government, which is, after all, bankrolling it. We are here, thousands of kilometres from the impact area, but it is this Commonwealth government writing the cheques that makes this project even possible—and that is one of the ghost policies of Prime Minister Abbott that we are still dealing with today.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Even worse is the reliance on offsets to approve the project and the failure of the offset conditions to even comply with the government's own policy. I do not know whether senators would be aware of what an offset is when it is put into environmental conditions. It does not mean that the government has to go out and plant 100 hectares of banksia woodland and restore ecosystems to their former intact state, not at all; it is simply the drawing of a rectangle around an area of bushland that already exists and a commitment to not flatten it at some stage into the future.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The questions that we put to the minister included: is it the intention that the endangered cockatoos at these wetlands will find their way to the new offsets 100 kilometres from the Beeliar wetlands? How will the cockatoos be notified? Are you going to set up a website? How are you going to get them there? Are you going to set up a new bus route? Exactly how are these offsets meant to work? What it betrays, unfortunately, is an incredible illiteracy as to how ecosystems function. This is a tragic and avoidable destruction of a precious place.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We have evidence to believe that the surveys of the black cockatoos were never even conducted. The community groups who have been spearheading the campaign to protect this area and to create a much saner freight strategy for the Perth metropolitan area have had eyes on that site for months. It is our understanding that that work simply has not been done. We have been asking for copies of the surveys. We have been asking for responses not to just to my letters but to those representing the 40 or so citizen scientists who are working around the clock to report the breaches on site. We have been begging the minister to send compliance officers and shut down works until these things can be investigated but has come to nothing and that is why I am asking for an explanation as to why my questions still remain unanswered.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Before the minister provides an answer though, I would like the government senators and members to be absolutely crystal clear: this is that an election-defining issue back in Perth. This costly debacle is going to cost Premier Barnett government; that is the way the polls are running. There are a lot of people working across Western Australia and across political divides—the Greens, the Australian Labor Party—and this project is so reckless and pathetic that even One Nation have come out and said they oppose it. The project is a disaster but it is somehow fitting that the final legacy of eight empty and pointless years of the Barnett government will be a five-kilometre stretch of complete ruination that will take many years to repair.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Western Australia</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">15:11</span>):  I was not going to rise to speak on this matter but those who might be listening need to have Senator Ludlam's comments put into perspective. If I can draw attention firstly to the legal challenges of those opposed to the Roe 8 project, the first was a challenge to the Supreme Court in Western Australia, not so much to the project but to the manner of environmental approval by the Environmental Protection Authority. Chief Justice Wayne Martin upheld the request of the applicants. On appeal, unanimously, Chief Justice Martin's colleagues in the Supreme Court of Western Australia overturned the decision and, in fact, the project was approved to proceed. Senator Ludlam did not make that point in his contribution.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I then turn to the matter of the Federal Court in which a challenge took place to the approval by the federal environment minister. In January this year that was also overturned, and the decision of the federal minister was upheld. But it is important that there be some historic perspective of this because Roe 8 was part of the Stephenson plan from the 1950s, a plan which had gone internationally to tender and Stephenson—a Scotsman—and his associates had won the tender to develop an overall transport plan for metropolitan Perth. So successful was it that Stephenson moved his family from Scotland to Perth to oversee that project. Much of what we see today in place—the freeway system, the highway networks et cetera—were all there as part of the Stephenson plan.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">In her wisdom, the then state minister for transport, Alannah MacTiernan—having once been in the state parliament, briefly in this one and now back being recycled again in the state election for another crack at the state parliament—working in conjunction with the then member for Fremantle, Mr McGinty, decided that they would stop the conclusion of the Stephenson plan into Fremantle port. In so doing, they had the land rezoned and they had that component of it zoned residential. The then secretary, I think, of the Transport Workers Union in WA at that time resoundingly criticised Ms MacTiernan and Mr McGinty for the foolhardiness and stupidity of the decision they took. That secretary was a person for whom I have enormous regard. He is now in the Senate. It is Senator Glenn Sterle, and he was quite right when he criticised Ms MacTiernan and Mr McGinty for their failure to give effect to the conclusion of a program that was some 40 years in the making.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The reason the progress is now occurring with Roe 8 and Roe 9 is so there can be reasonable movement of heavy transport to and from the Port of Fremantle. Into the future, if and when—as you know, Deputy President Lines, because you are Western Australian—there may well be an outer harbour constructed down in the Kwinana area to assist in future freight demands, Roe 8 will always be needed to be built. The actions of then transport minister MacTiernan are even worse, because those of us familiar with the Roe Highway know that as we come to the Kwinana Freeway, very close to my parliamentary office, there is a project which was referred to as Roe 7. It was always intended that roadworks should be put into place so that Roe 8 would continue in an east-west direction across the north-south Kwinana Freeway. Minister MacTiernan, in her actions, ensured that there would be no future provision made for a Roe 8, and today several tens of millions of dollars have been added to the taxpayer burden as a result of the refusal of minister MacTiernan at that time to allow for the future provision of Roe 8.</span>

                  </a>  I have walked all of Roe 8. It adjoins a road which already exists. It goes over a limited area of wetland, it is true, but what has not been said here this afternoon is that several million dollars are being expended to ensure that the nature of the building of bridges over that area is such that they will have the least adverse environmental impact. There will be movement capacity for people who use the area. I want to remind those who might be interested that I had the opportunity on several occasions to journey over a similar wetland in Louisiana, America, between the cities of Lafayette and Baton Rouge. That particular road is two bridges—one in each direction; each dual carriageway—and they are 40 kilometres long, or 23 miles. I have made it my business, in investigating Roe 8 and 9, to receive information from the Louisiana Department of Environmental Quality as to the apparent adverse impact of that 40-kilometre-by-two highway over the affected wetland area. The advice to me has been that it has actually improved the aquatic environment of that space during that time.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">I have an enormous amount of respect for Senator Ludlam, but I do have to take issue with him here. People have every right to protest in a democracy. We all have the right to protest, but there is a rule of law, and the rule of law says you take your case to the courts and you must respect the decision of the courts. We have seen interruptions from people who have flatly refused to accept the democratic process in the state of Western Australia. They have chained themselves to machinery, abused those responsible for commencing the project, and climbed into trees—naked, for whatever reason—with every hope and intent of stopping that work. The cost in salary and overtime to the Western Australian Police Service, when they should have been out attending to other work, has been monstrous.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I will conclude with this comment. It was put me to me recently that this is some recent initiative of the Western Australian government. I have in my possession—not in front of me—a newspaper from September 2008, when I was standing in the state election in Western Australia for the seat of Alfred Cove, evidenced by the fact that my advertisement and face appear on that front page. The headline in that local newspaper in 2008 was 'Libs to proceed with Roe project.' So let there be no doubt in the minds of those who are questioning the democratic opportunity here that back in 2008—not the last state election; the state election before that—our party had said we were going to proceed with Roe 8. That is the democratic process. People elected the Barnett government in 2008 in the full knowledge that that project would go ahead. They re-elected the Barnett government in 2013 knowing the project would go ahead. It is interesting that we find ourselves here today in the circumstances that this disputation is now claimed to somehow or other have recently arisen. The funding is in place. It is the continuation of a 40-year project. I will be the first to say that I think the government in Western Australia and its department could well have sold the issue better.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">But let me say this as I wind up my contribution: the city of Cockburn, with whom I have a tremendous relationship, commissioned a study of inquiry into what would happen if Roe 8 was not built. Well, of course it is dominated by people who are opposed to the project, and they attempted to bury it, to explain what the enormity of the traffic congestion will be and the risks if Roe 8 is not built. Fortunately one councillor—and I do not need to go into the politics of the council of Cockburn—ensured that that report was made public. Indeed, what did it reveal? It revealed the importance of proceeding with what Stephenson came up with in the fifties: there is a group of councils called the South West Group; it is Fremantle, East Fremantle, Melville, Cockburn, Kwinana and Rockingham. And that South West Group independently had assessed the impact on road safety, on rail safety and indeed on transport activities. Once again, the members of that group of councils who did not want the results made public did their best to make sure that report was buried. And that report has surfaced, and it emphasises the enormous risk that will happen to that area of the southern suburbs of Perth if Roe 8 is not built.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">It was not my intention to speak today on this matter, but I do want to correct the record. I want people to know that this is and has been a democratic process. The courts at state and federal level have been involved. The people have known for years what is going to happen. And I simply say that it does not do any good at all for small amounts of information to be presented in this place that give the suggestion that it will not be challenged.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Western Australia</span>—<span class="HPS-MinisterialTitles">Australian Greens Whip</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">15:24</span>):  I would like to make a contribution to this debate as well, provoked by Senator Back. It is all very well for Senator Back to selectively quote facts, as he was accusing Senator Ludlam of doing. If you are talking about the Stephenson plan, the government has gone way off the Stephenson plan; it went away from that plan years ago. If we were going to stick to that, it would have meant a freeway going up Stock Road, across Stock Road and into Alfred Cove at Point Walter, across the river and into Dalkeith. For those of you who do not know Perth, Dalkeith and around Point Walter and Alfred Cove are two of the wealthiest suburbs in Perth, so of course they did not want that to happen. Did we stick to that plan in WA? No, we did not, but that was part of the Stephenson plan. There was a whole lot of other really urban design involved in that plan, and really good rail. Has that rail been put in place? No. So, stop quoting the Stephenson plan to us. Governments over the years have thrown that out. There was some really good stuff there that was never done. So, do not say, 'Oh, now we should stick to the Stephenson plan.' I bet your wealthy mates did not want that road going through Dalkeith or going through Alfred Cove. When are you going to start lobbying for that road to go in?</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">When we talk about 'just a little bit of wetlands', you have to remember that the context in Western Australia is that we have lost on the Swan Coastal Plain 85 per cent of our wetlands. So, 'just another wetland' does not wash with those people who are trying to conserve the last little bit of wetlands that we have on the Swan Coastal Plain and who have fought for years and years to protect the Beeliar Regional Park and in fact to get the Beeliar Regional Park in place. I was there. I was campaigning from the word go on those regional parks, in particular the Beeliar Regional Park. It is of extremely important ecological value. It is a tragedy, watching those banksia woodlands being destroyed, which is what is happening. They are home to Carnaby's black cockatoos, which are threatened. These are very important banksia woodlands.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">What was also selectively left out of the discussion was the fact that Perth has also lost most of our banksia woodlands. These are important areas in a city that has lost its wetlands, that has lost a lot of its urban vegetation. These are the last remaining areas. And to say that it was in a plan a long time ago, when there have been deviations from that plan over many years, is completely out of context in the discussion. The community does not want this to go ahead. And the Liberal government knows damn well they do not want it to go ahead, and they are going to see some of those seats fall because they are ramming this out-of-date Roe 8 through. To say that there is a plan there and that it is going to go right through to the port is nonsense. They do not have the next part of that in place to get it through to the port of Fremantle.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">When I was asking questions in estimates, the department confirmed that unless the business case is presented they will not be getting the funding for the completed freeway. As yet, that business case certainly has not been made public. So to say that it is funded is a misnomer, because it is not. They do not have those plans in place yet. They are not taking Roe 8 through to the port. So, to say that it is through to the port is absolute nonsense. There are perfectly valid alternatives that would deal with the issues Senator Back was talking about—some of the local councils down there being concerned about the cost to them. The Perth Regional Development Authority has some very encouraging plans about how you could take alternative transport down to a future outer harbour further south of the existing port of Fremantle.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">That is not to say that everyone has endorsed it yet, but they are very encouraging plans. So, when we are having the debate, let's actually get all those facts on the table. People in Perth do not want Roe 8. They do not want to see Beeliar Regional Park and the Beeliar wetlands affected. It is tragic to see that vegetation that is being lost. We do not need to lose any more of our banksia woodland, all for a road that people do not want, that is going to be out of date—it is out of date; it is out-of-date planning. Move to the future. Support an alternative approach and let's stop Roe 8 right now.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Queensland</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">15:29</span>):  Just briefly, I do not know this particular area terribly well—I am a Queensland senator from the north—but whenever the Greens run a campaign you always have to be suspicious. I want to thank Senator Back very much for telling those of us in the Senate who are interested in this what the real facts are. With the Greens political party, you have to always distinguish their political campaigns from their so-called environmental credentials. Senator Ludlam let the cat out of the bag when he told us all—as if we did not know—that there was an election coming up in Western Australia in the not too distant future. Of course, the Greens and the Labor Party, as a combined group as always, are fighting to defeat the Liberal government that has done so much for Western Australia over the past nine years. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">But I rise in this debate simply to thank Senator Back. It is good that we have people like Senator Back, who know the facts, who can go through the history and who can tell it as it is, rather than listening to the mistruths and misconceptions of the Greens political party. I live in Queensland, and this is what we hear all the time from the Greens and their mates in the radical conservation groups. They will tell any lie at all to try and achieve their aims. I was interested in Senator Back's account of the court actions that have been taken. As I understand it, the courts have ruled against the line of the Greens political party and their radical green allies and ruled in favour of the law. The same happens in my state of Queensland. In Queensland, we desperately need the Adani rail and coal project. But the Greens political party representatives—the few of them that there are—and their radical green organisation counterparts keep taking court case after court case to try and stop this project, which means so much for jobs and wealth for all Queenslanders. It would be a fantastic project. It has unilateral support, except for the Greens political party. Even—I have to say to my colleagues over the aisle here—the Queensland Labor government has at last recognised the importance of this project and supports it. All the facts, all the evidence and all the scientific reports are there.</span>

              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Small">That the Senate take note of the answers given by the Attorney-General (Senator Brandis) and the Minister for Industry, Innovation and Science (Senator Sinodinos) to questions without notice asked by the Leader of the Opposition in the Senate (Senator Wong) and Senator Carr today relating to unemployment.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Today the Leader of the Government in the Senate was asked: with 34,000 full-time jobs lost in 2016 and 19,800 more people in the unemployment queue now than when the Abbott-Turnbull government was elected in 2013, is it not clear that the government is delivering fewer jobs and fewer opportunities? I was surprised that the minister's answer was to say that the government's policies were working. I put a simple proposition to those who actually believe that to be true: they should simply ask someone who does not. They will be able to explain that the fact that there were 34,000 full-time jobs lost last year and that there are nearly 20,000 more people on the unemployment queues since this government took office is demonstrable evidence that the government's policies are not working. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The Leader of the Government in the Senate suggested that the employment situation in this country was buoyant. Buoyant! What struck me was how remarkable it was that the government was so lacking in empathy. A position of great economic and social distress is being reflected right across this country in so many communities. So many communities are facing the uncertainty of the economic conditions. The enormous pressures that have been placed on working families have caused concern and anxiety, and the government's response is to say, 'The employment situation is buoyant.' This is making an assumption about seasonal unemployment, which is now 5.8 per cent according to the ABS—an assumption that I say is open to question. The survey results from the ABS rely upon the presumption that a person is working for an hour a week. There is considerable academic literature to suggest that the ABS surveys grossly understate the level of underemployment and the number of people who are without jobs.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The new Minister for Industry, Innovation and Science was recently quoted as saying that we had to accept that some industries will die. He reflected on that today, and he once again said essentially that we should accept the proposition that there is somehow or other a natural process at work here. In regard to the automotive industry, it is absolutely clear that there is no natural process here because the government made a political decision to force the automotive companies out of Australia. That was reflected by the fact that the Treasurer at the time in 2013 asked General Motors to 'come clean' and 'be fair dinkum'—'Either you're here or you're not.' The Acting Prime Minister at the time said to the chamber:</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Small">… today I have written to the general manager of Holden, Mr Devereux, asking General Motors to make an immediate statement clarifying their intentions in this country.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">It is quite clear what the threat was. In the context of the government saying they were going to withdraw industry assistance, there was no doubt whatsoever. In fact, at the time <span style="font-style:italic;">The Age</span> quoted a text message by a company executive:</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Small">Are you seeing this question time attack on Holden? Taunting [Holden] to leave? It's extraordinary.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">So there is nothing natural about a proposition where this government has sought to destroy an industry, nothing natural about a political decision to drive the automotive manufacturers Holden and Toyota out of this country, nothing natural about the enormous social and economic cost that that decision will have for this country. There is absolutely no doubt in my mind that the cost to this country will be measured as far greater than any level of assistance provided to those industries—the cost in terms of health, the cost in terms of social disruption and of course the cost in terms of the dole queues. This is a government that says it is interested in investment but it drives away international companies that provide support for up to 200,000 jobs in this country, provide support for what is a key element of manufacturing in this country. At the time General Motors reminded us that for every dollar spent by the automotive industry $30 was generated throughout the economy—200,000 high-skill, high-wage, important jobs, the backbone of our manufacturing sector. This government made a decision to destroy manufacturing in this country in the automotive industry, and now they face the consequences of that. <span style="font-style:italic;">(Time expired)</span></span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Queensland</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">15:40</span>):  Those of us who have been around this place for a while, as I have, will remember that Senator Carr was once the minister for industry. We remember how in question time after question time, speech after speech, Senator Carr was softening up Australia for the bad news. It was during the time of his leadership of the industry portfolio that the manufacturers decided it was time to get out of Australia. The subsidies the government was then giving—taxpayers funding these multinational or American companies—were no longer viable. Senator Carr knew that himself, and he presided over the downturn of the car industry, which occurred just after the Labor government was defeated at the 2013 election.</span>

                    <span class="HPS-MemberContinuation">Senator IAN MACDONALD:</span>
                  </a>  Thank you, Senator Bushby—Ford did announce their departure while Senator Carr was the minister. I only raise that to put Senator Carr's comments in perspective. I have to say there is one element of Senator Carr's speech I do agree with. I accept the minister's confirmation that on the statistics, on the figures, employment is doing okay in Australia. But I come from North Queensland. I know the impact of unemployment there. That is one of the reasons I have been so keen to support this Singapore deal and the expansion of the High Range army training field. The Singaporean taxpayer, not the Australian taxpayer, is going to pour some $2 billion-plus into upgrading this area. The government has given a commitment that the work done in upgrading the area, which will be quite substantial for a whole range of contractors, will be done by local contractors, by local businesses in the Townsville and Rockhampton region. Those businesses will employ people—they will support other small businesses in those communities that are currently struggling. That is why I have been such a strong supporter of that particular project, because it will help with the unemployed in Townsville and Rockhampton, it will help with the small businesses struggling in Townsville and Rockhampton. This proposal to expand the army base is for Australia's benefit—it is for the use of Australian defence forces in extending their training. Their training has to be changed because 3 Brigade has now become not just the light infantry brigade it was but also it now has cavalry units, and so the training area has to expand. That involves quite significant development work, and it will create jobs for Townsville's unemployed and for the small business people that I look after in the area. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I mentioned previously on another topic the proposal for the Adani coalmine and the rail line from the coal site to Abbott Point—major infrastructure projects for Australia, for my state of Queensland, that will help the Queensland budget. Dearie me, the current government we have in Queensland needs every bit of help it can get with the state budget. It is good for Australia; but, more importantly, it is good for those unemployed, those quite substantial numbers of unemployed in central and north Queensland who are there because of the downturn of the mining industry and the closure of the Queensland Nickel refinery in Townsville. There are a lot of people out of work.</span>
              </p>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">So on that I agree with Senator Carr. I am desperate, as is the government I am part of, to make sure that we do whatever we can to provide real jobs for the unemployed and to help struggling small businesses. Small businesses are mums and dads who put their life savings into their business. Through no fault of their own, with the downturn of the mining industry, a lot of them are struggling to stay afloat. The Adani project and the Singapore deal, which will require expansion for Australia of Australia's training bases, will provide those jobs, that support and that lifeline for small business in the north. We as a government will do everything we can to continue to grow employment opportunities in Australia.</span>

                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Senator KETTER</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Queensland</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">15:45</span>):  I rise to make a contribution in respect of the issue of jobs and this government's manifest failure to do anything productive in that area. In fact their attitude is quite destructive about the creation of jobs in this country, borne out by the fact that 34,000 full-time jobs were lost in 2016. I am totally gobsmacked by the fact that in Senator MacDonald's contribution to this debate he would raise the issue of the Shoalwater Bay acquisition—that complete bungling of the exercise by this government. We have seen a government which says it is interested in job creation totally bungle this acquisition in the Shoalwater Bay area, where I think some 60 or so graziers were informed that their land was potentially going to be compulsorily acquired. Those good people were put through quite a lot of concern, angst and confusion for some months, only to have the Prime Minister today rule out any compulsory land acquisition. That has been completely bungled. The government failed to put forward a case. It did not provide the numbers, it did not provide a proper plan as to what was in place there. So heaven help us in this country. If this government is putting its mind to job creation I think we are all in trouble.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We see nothing better to illustrate this than the departure of Senator Bernardi from the ranks of government today. This is a government which is divided upon itself. A government which cannot govern itself cannot govern the country. It is no wonder that people throughout Australia, particularly in regional Queensland, are losing faith in the political class when we see this dysfunction and chaos in our government.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">In terms of creation of jobs, we know that this government has a centrepiece of a corporate tax rate reduction, which they say is the answer to the creation of jobs. We are very, very concerned about that. We consider that to be basically corporate tax welfare. It is a windfall for foreign companies and for the banks. It relies on the trickle-down approach, which I think has now been discredited by many respected economists. Senator Carr has talked about what I consider to be the economic vandalism associated with loss of support for the car industry, an industry which took decades to build up. Tens of thousands of jobs are now at risk, and there is the potential flow-on effect for research and development in this country, which I think is a particular disgrace.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I want to use my remaining time to talk about another example of this government's wanton disregard for the creation of jobs, particularly in relation to its attitude to the Brisbane Cross River Rail project—a $5.5 billion project which has the support of Infrastructure Australia and Building Queensland, the independent bodies which assess infrastructure projects. This is a project in Brisbane which would cater for future growth, unlock economic growth opportunities for the state and make Queensland more internationally competitive. It has been estimated that it would add $3.3 billion to gross state product. Some consider this to be in fact the number one infrastructure project in Australia, but we have a government which is failing to invest in Queensland. It is failing to invest in what can be objectively seen as a very, very worthwhile project. We know that Infrastructure Australia deemed this project ready to go in 2012. We know that the previous Prime Minister had a somewhat strange propensity to fail to invest in public transport. We now have a Prime Minister who seems to like taking selfies on trains and claims to be an advocate for public transport, but it is reprehensible that the government has not come forward with the necessary investment to bring this project to fruition. The coalition government has done nothing on Cross River Rail for more than three years. I think this is contributing to the damaging of the Queensland economy, and the government needs to reconsider its position in respect of this matter.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Western Australia</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">15:51</span>):  I wonder if the day could ever come when we could have a mature discussion in a non-adversarial way about an issue that is critically important to all Australians—unemployment. I admire Senator Ketter and I respect him, but his opening words were 'manifest failure', 'destructive', 'gobsmacked'. We are all concerned about unemployment. You have figures of 34,000 jobs lost—that was the comment by senators Ketter and Carr. The Attorney-General says 95,000 new full-time jobs in the fourth quarter of 2016—half a million jobs. I wonder if the day could ever come when all of us representing the electorates we do could sit down and say, 'Let's leave the adversary at the door and have a reasonable discussion about what is possible.'</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">On the one hand we say—on the other side, we are concerned that any tax cuts are just going to go to the banks and the multinationals. We all know that the biggest employer group in this country are small businesses. They employ 45 per cent of all Australians. As someone who comes from regional Western Australia, I can tell you that it is small businesses in regional WA that employs people. It is small businesses that take kids on. It is small businesses that are the ones most affected. Yet we all know that, particularly in a small business space, if you drop the tax, it adds to improved and increased employment. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We talk about penalty rates. Our side says, 'Just bring Sundays and public holidays down to Saturday.' You on the other side say that is the end of the world as we know it. And those who do not work mid-week, like single mums and students, miss out because businesses do not open. Is it possible for us ever in this place to have a reasonable argument amongst colleagues? </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We hear about the car manufacturing industry and the loss of jobs, but it was Mitsubishi that closed up under the last government and it was Ford who announced they were going to close up under the last government, yet we are being lambasted because of Toyota and General Motors. I am reminded of the fact that Toyota wanted to go the Fair Work Commission and say, 'At the current EBA levels that we are paying people, we can't survive.' So what happens? The union movement and the then government of the day and the Fair Work Commission say, 'No. No changes.' So what happens? Toyota announce that they are going to close up. How frustrating is that. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Senator Gallacher and I were responsible for a Senate inquiry into our relationship with Mexico. As a result of that inquiry, there were seminars in Adelaide and in Melbourne to say that the vehicle component manufacturing industry in Mexico will need us to be able to provide for their three million cars per year. We all know the stats. Out of the million new cars a year, 900,000 are imported. And it is people like these in the gallery making the decision. I do not want a locally manufactured motor car. If I was allowed to I would ask for a straw poll and I know that nine out of 10 would say that we do not have an Australian manufactured car. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I look at the seasonal worker situation. At this moment there is fruit on vines and trees rotting because, whatever the mechanisms are, we cannot get young Australians and others to go out and pick the fruit. So we rely on seasonal workers from the Pacific and we rely on backpackers from overseas. I go through the agricultural areas and I ask: why are there no young locals on tractors during seeding and harvest? Am I happy about that? No. And yet we cannot have a reasonable discussion about this. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We cannot talk about electricity prices because it is going to be adversarial. And yet I learned the other day in South Australia that next to labour costs the highest costs on business is electricity, so they are putting workers off. I have been bleating away for five years in this place about electricity prices. I was the first person to say that power costs were going to go up dramatically in South Australia and they were going to have a state-wide blackout. I look at the issues associated with tourism: 80,000 jobs desperately needed, 80,000 long-term unemployed. Why can't we have a reasonable collegial discussion instead of this adversarial nonsense. <span style="font-style:italic;">(Time expired)</span></span>

                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Senator GALLACHER</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">South Australia</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">15:56</span>):  I too rise to make a contribution in this debate taking note of answers given by Senator Brandis and Senator Sinodinos. Just to recap slightly: we went to election on 2 July or thereabouts in 2016, and the Hon. Malcolm Turnbull was successful. He delivered the Senate that we currently have. And there are many new faces—some of them welcome, some not so welcome. But the reality is he has to own his work. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">If the ABS is saying at the end of 2016 that the unemployment rate has risen to 5.8 per cent—741,000 unemployed Australians—he has to own that work. If under Malcolm Turnbull there are 19,800 more people lining the unemployment queue than when the Abbott-Turnbull government was elected in 2013 and there are fewer full-time jobs, he has to own that work. That is his work. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">When you look at the international debate at the moment, there is a recently elected person who, when the facts do not agree with his position, puts out alternative facts. In some degree Senator Brandis attempted to do that today. But the electorate does know that those alternative facts are really a word that starts with B, ends with T, and has a middle letter of S. The real people out there who care about unemployment, who care about the hundreds of thousands of youth unemployed who are not getting access to jobs or traineeships or apprenticeships, know that these alternative facts which are thrown around the chamber are actually mistruths—I will not say lies, but they are a misrepresentation of the work that the ABS does. Senator Carr has put on the record that there is both academic and public scepticism about the way we measure unemployment anyway. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Sufficed to say that if you move around your electorate—and I move around the seat of Grey—there is real concern about unemployment. There is real concern about loss of jobs and ability to get into jobs. When you look at what is happening in the automotive industry—that is a direct indictment of this current government. We were sending $1.5 billion worth of cars to the Middle East. What have we replaced that with? Carrots? Sheep? Some vegetables? That is an awful lot of produce that needs to go to Saudi Arabia to replace the $600 million worth of Toyotas that were imported by that country. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">When I had the privilege of going to Saudi Arabia on a trade delegation, through the Joint Standing Committee on Foreign Affairs, Defence and Trade, they said: 'Why aren't you making cars anymore? We love your cars. We buy them. Why aren't you sending them our way anymore?' It is difficult to explain to people that we had a federal government that chose to do away with making cars per se. Toyota had a successful business and probably could have stayed, had there been another manufacturer alive. But they could not support their export simply on the basis of being the only manufacturer of motor vehicles in Australia. This government walked away from that.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I will go back to my central theme: you have to own the work you have done. As we all agree, the ABS stats may be a bit problematic, but they are the only stats we have. If they show that unemployment is increasing, that goes back to the Prime Minister, his government and his policies. If there are more people are seeking employment than can get fully employed, he has to be cognisant of that and put in place policies to deal with that. The reality is that he has got nothing substantial through the parliament to address these issues, and it looks like he does not even have an agenda in his Prime Minister and Cabinet area which will help. Sure, you want to cut tax; cut tax, fine, but people are already in front of you. The United States is saying 15 per cent tax. I think Ireland is already at 12 per cent. What is it—a race for big business to pay no tax? Half of them, as we know from several inquiries, do not appear to be stepping up to meet their obligations, with transfer-pricing, housing company headquarters in Singapore and the rest of these matters. Mr Turnbull has to own his results. Unemployment is up, underemployment is up and youth unemployment is up. <span style="font-style:italic;">(Time expired)</span></span>

              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Small">That the Senate take note of the answer given by the Minister for Education and Training (Senator Birmingham) to a question without notice asked by Senator Lambie today relating to the Renewable Energy Target.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The renewable energy scheme, or the RET, almost shut down heavy industry in Tasmania and caused the loss of up to 10,000 jobs and billions of dollars to our economy. One of the reasons I resigned from Palmer United and became an independent was because of a poor RET deal endorsed by former US Vice President Al Gore. The RET system effectively puts in place a $3 billion tax, paid by every electricity user in Australia, and is a direct threat to the financial security of every Tasmanian business, worker and family, without one benefit or positive effect on the world's average temperature or the environment.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Mr Abbott got it wrong for so long, supporting the RET, but he has changed his mind and is finally right: the RET scheme should be scrapped. The government must do everything in its power to ensure that Australia's electricity, gas and power prices—given all the natural wealth and resources we have been blessed with—are the cheapest in the world. If we do not do that, one thing is absolutely guaranteed: Australian workers, wages and living conditions will decrease rapidly in comparison to the rest of the world. The only hope our grandchildren and great grandchildren have of enjoying the relatively high living standards Australians experience today is to have the cheapest and most reliable electricity and power in the world. That will allow our businesses to make healthy profits while employing Australian workers and competing with overseas businesses, who are not paying their workers the same rates as Australian workers. These overseas competitors to our businesses do not have to match the high and expensive environmental and workplace safety standards that we have in our country. Compared to Australian businesses, these overseas competitors underpay their workers and cut corners on workplace health and safety and on environmental standards. The only way our manufacturing and primary industries will be able to compete against the rest of the world is to use the natural resources we have been gifted and blessed with—coal, gas and uranium—to provide guaranteed reliable, cheap power for our pensioners, families and businesses.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">In Tasmania, both the Liberal state government and the Labor opposition party have badly and incompetently managed our hydro system, which of course is a reliable renewable source of baseload power. Indeed, hydro is the best source of renewable power, because it is reliable, not intermittent, and able to provide cheap electricity. Tasmania almost ran out of electricity because of criminally poor management of the levels of water in our hydro storage dams by our Liberal state government. Because all the water was let out of our dams, we were forced to set up and run diesel generators—according to a letter I have received from the Acting Premier—at an estimated cost of $64 million and supplementary gas generation at an estimated cost of $47 million. Under the current RET system, the majority of our state's energy, even though it is renewable, does not count and is not allowed to contribute to the national total for the renewable energy target, so we have never been properly paid for the renewable energy that is generated in Tasmania. We have been dudded billions of dollars by the Liberal and Labor parties, who set up and run the RET system, but our businesses have all been made to pay tens of millions a year in an unfair RET tax.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Sadly, a fact that is never acknowledged in the RET debate—and that I tried to highlight in my questions to the minister today—is this: even if mainland Australia caught up to Tasmania, with 95 per cent renewable energy, it would not stop the world's climate from changing. Our RET system and forcing Australian pensioners, businesses, workers and families to pay, artificially, an extra $3 billion a year for their energy will have zero effect on the world's climate and the world's average temperature, which sits between 14.5 and 15 degrees Celsius. Geological records and ice core samples show that world's climate naturally changes over hundreds and thousands of years, and in the past the world's average temperature has been much hotter and much colder than today's average temperature, without any input from man-made CO2. Australia's RET and its expensive and unreliable energy, and forcing Tasmanian pensioners to pay more for their electricity, will not stop climate change. Let us scrap the RET, save Australian jobs and reduce our cost of living for pensioners, businesses, workers and families. That needs to be done now.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Small">That the Senate records its deep regret at the death, on 9 January 2017, of Emeritus Professor Russell Brunell Trood, former senator for Queensland, places on record its appreciation of his long and highly distinguished service to the nation and tenders its profound sympathy to his family in their bereavement.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">This is a day of great sorrow for government senators because our dear friend and esteemed former colleague, Russell Trood, died on 9 January, shortly after his 68th birthday. He had been diagnosed early last year with a rare, aggressive and incurable form of cancer. His death at such a relatively young age has shocked those of us who counted him as a friend.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Condolence motions are always sad occasions, but there is, of course, a special poignancy in a condolence motion in relation to someone who is so fresh in our memory as a colleague with whom we served in this chamber. It is less than six years ago that Russell left us when his term expired on the 30 June 2011. You could almost imagine him walking through the door or rising in his place to make one of his characteristically erudite and memorable contributions. Those of us who were privileged to attend a private funeral—which included both you and I, Mr President, and former senator Michael Ronaldson—and the many of us who attended the memorial service hosted by Griffith University in Brisbane last Friday know just how many people admired, respected and loved Russell Trood.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">He was born on 5 December 1948 in Melbourne, but his upbringing was in Sydney. Although his career was crowned by the six years he served as a senator between 2005 and 2011, most of his career was spent in the academy as a respected scholar in his specialist field of international relations. But politics was in his blood—literally. He was the great-grandson of Sir Arthur Rutledge, the Attorney-General in the government of Sir Samuel Griffith in colonial Queensland and one of the Queensland delegates to the 1891 Federation convention in Sydney. That was the convention in which the principal draft of the Constitution was authored by Sir Samuel Griffith. Russell's great-grandfather, Sir Arthur Rutledge, was at his side on that immensely important moment in Australian history.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">As a young man, Russell become involved in the Liberal Party in Sydney. He was active in the Pymble Young Liberals. He was educated at the University of Sydney, where he graduated LLB, and began his career as a solicitor. But the practice of law was not for him because his intellectual interests lay in international relations. So he went to the United Kingdom, did a masters in that discipline at the University of Aberystwyth in Wales and, for a time, worked in politics in the United Kingdom. It will tell you much about Russell's political philosophy and values that, when for a year he worked as a research officer for political party in London, it was not the conservative party for which he worked but the Liberal Party. Russell was in the great liberal tradition—the tradition in British politics represented by Gladstone and Asquith; the tradition in Australian politics represented by Deakin and Menzies. He was a thorough liberal. I remember that Russell used to occasionally regale me of the highlight of his career—working as a political staffer in the United Kingdom, with memories of the Sutton and Cheam by-election of December 1972. It was one of the Liberal Party's great victories—when it won a safe Tory home county seat with a swing of 38 per cent. Years later, Russell would himself be the subject of a very famous election victory.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">He returned from the United Kingdom to pursue a career as a scholar. He was a lecturer at the Australian National University between 1983 and 1988. Then, in 1989, he was recruited by Griffith University, where he was a lecturer and then senior lecturer between 1989 and 1996. He was the director of the Centre for the Study of Australian-Asian Relations at that university from 1990 until shortly before his election to the Senate, and associate professor of international relations at Griffith from 1997 to 2004, when he was elected to the Senate.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">After his time in the Senate came to an end, he returned to the academy. At the time of his death he was the director of the Centre for the Study of Australia-Asia Relations and he was a director of the Griffith Asia Institute. In acknowledgement of his long and distinguished career as a scholar, Griffith University conferred upon him the high honour of Emeritus Professor. While serving as a scholar, he was the author of many specialist works in the particular field Asian international relations and gave his support to many learned bodies. He was the president of the Queensland branch of the Australian Institute of International Affairs, he served as a member of the national executive of the Australian Institute of International Affairs, he was a board member of the Australia-Indonesia Institute, he was a member of the Foreign Affairs Council and he was a member of the editorial board of the <span style="font-style:italic;">Australian Journal of International Affairs</span>, among many other distinctions.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Politics, along with the study of international relations, was Russell's other love. In the 1990s he became involved in the Liberal Party. That is where I first encountered him: in the branches of the Liberal Party—the Sherwood branch, in fact, in the western suburbs of Brisbane. He served in various roles, including as a member of the Liberal Party state executive, between 1999 and 2003. It was very obvious to me when I encountered Russell Trood that we were like-minded. It was also very obvious to me that he wanted to be a senator, and so did I. We should have been rivals, but we never were. We formed a fast and lasting friendship and, when I stood for preselection for the Senate in 2000, Russell supported me.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">In 2001 he ran for the Senate himself in a lower position on the Liberal Senate ticket. And then, in 2004, he won the No. 3 position on the Liberal Senate ticket. In those days in Queensland there was intense competition between the Liberal Party and the National Party, and nowhere was that competition more intense than for the third Senate place—it being reckoned that the conservative side would never win more than three seats. The National Party candidate, someone of whom we had never heard but of whom we would hear much more in the years to come, was Barnaby Joyce.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The Liberal ticket comprised Brett Mason, Russell and me, with Russell at No. 3 on the ticket, and we thought that we were in a race between Russell and Barnaby for the third non-Labor position. It never crossed our minds that both could win, and we spent weeks on end—Russell, Brett and me—travelling around Queensland over the course of that campaign. Those were joyous times, and we were happy warriors. The soundtrack of our campaign was a blend of Russell's fine taste in music and Brett Mason's execrable taste in music, and so it was to the backing track of Bizet, Verdi and The Carpenters that we travelled the length and breadth of Queensland for all those weeks.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I will never forget the night of the 2004 election at Russell's home when it appeared that both he and Barnaby Joyce had won. In his valedictory speech, former senator John Cherry, whose place Russell took, calculated that the difference was 2,720 votes. It was a historic result because not only was it the first and only time that either of the major parties had won four of the six Senate places at a half-Senate election but it was, of course, also the result that gave the Howard government control of the Senate. That will not be Russell's only place in history, but it is a sure one.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">In July 2005 Russell Trood arrived in the Senate. He was part of the cohort to which you, Mr President, also belonged, and he immediately made an impact. One of the reasons I think Russell immediately made an impact is that he looked so much like a senator. He was almost everyone's idea of the senator from central casting, but he made an impact through his contribution to debate. I can still hear in my mind's ear that lovely voice. It was polite, persuasive, rich, erudite and plangent. You could hardly fail to be persuaded by what Russell had to say.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">He was, in his time here, the best-educated person in the parliament. But he wore his learning lightly. He was gentle. He was generous. He was decent. He was immensely popular amongst government senators and much respected across the chamber. When Russell left the Senate, the then leader of the Labor Party and Leader of the Government in the Senate, Senator Chris Evans, had this to say about him:</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Small">Senator Russell Trood only had one term here. In many ways that is a shame because I think he had a lot to contribute and did not get the opportunity to continue to do so in a way that would have been good for the parliament and for the Liberal Party.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">

                <span class="HPS-Small">I think it was good for the Liberal Party and for the Senate that you were elected … You also behave much more like people's image of a traditional senator.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Small">Rather than being a grubby party politician, he brings free thought, an interest in ideas and a style that reflects that sort of approach. I say that very genuinely. I think the parliament and the Senate have benefited from his academic background and expertise …</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The Senate these days has, I think, suffered a lot. I think its reputation, I am sorry to say, for all sorts of reasons is at a relatively low ebb. I think the Australian people, if they could imagine an ideal of the Senate and what the Senate should be, would imagine that it were a chamber of men and women committed to public service who debate the great issues of the nation politely and passionately, with wisdom, decency and learning. Well, that is what we had with Russell Trood, because that is exactly what he was like.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">As a friend and as a matter of principle, he was extraordinary. I will never forget when in 2008 the Liberal and National parties amalgamated in Queensland and an issue arose about the order of the Senate ticket. I was a member of the shadow cabinet. Brett Mason was a member of the executive as a shadow parliamentary secretary. Barnaby Joyce was the Leader of the National Party in the Senate. Russell was a backbench senator. Russell insisted, at his own cost, that the Senate ticket should reflect the order of seniority, even though that had the result of putting him in the fourth position, a position unlikely to be won again—and it was not. That was an extraordinary act of friendship to me and to Brett Mason. It shows the largeness of the person whom we mourn today.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">As a scholar and in particular as a scholar of history, Russell was interested in the long run. He could see the course of events not over hours, days or weeks but over years and decades. He was one of the only voices in the coalition party room to oppose the invasion of Iraq. He said, 'Loathsome as Saddam Hussein is, if we displace the regional strongman, that will destabilise Iraq with unpredictable consequences not only for Iraq but for the rest of the Middle East. In years to come, we will still not know how unstable we will have made that region.' With the learning of history, who can say that he was wrong?</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">In 2008 he was a vigorous opponent of the amalgamation of the Liberal and National parties in Queensland. He said, 'If you fuse the parties, you will create a political space on the right, particularly in regional Queensland, that may well be filled by either the One Nation party or other more right-wing parties.' Who can say that he was wrong? So Russell had a wisdom born both of experience and of deep learning.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">For him to be taken from his family, his friends and his colleagues at the academy at such a young age is a cruel blow. I visited Russell in the last couple of months of his life. His courage in the end that he knew was imminent is beyond my words to describe. He did say that he hoped to live beyond 8 November to see the defeat of Donald Trump. So he did not get everything he wished for. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I thank the patience of the Senate for allowing me to express, at slightly longer length than is customary on these occasions, my esteem for a dear friend, a great senator, a person who made this institution better, who graced public life in an exemplary manner and for whose friendship and collegiality we are all the better and for whose passing we are grievously poorer. I extend my deepest sympathy to his widow Dale, his son James, his daughter Phoebe, his brother Arty. I thank the Senate for their expression of appreciation for the life and contribution of this wonderful man.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">
                  <a href="00AOU" type="MemberSpeech">
                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Senator WONG</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">South Australia</span>—<span class="HPS-MinisterialTitles">Leader of the Opposition in the Senate</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">16:31</span>):  I rise on behalf of the opposition to acknowledge the passing of former senator Russell Brunell Trood, who passed away last month at the age of 68. At the outset I convey our condolences to his wife Dale, his children James and Phoebe and to all of his relatives and friends. I particularly extend my sympathies to those in this chamber who served with Professor Trood, as I did, and who are feeling this loss personally. I know Senator Brandis mourns the loss of a trusted confidant and one of his closest political friends. I extend my personal condolences to Senator Brandis.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Russell Trood served as a senator for a single six-year term from 2005 to 2011 and, as Senator Brandis has outlined, he was elected from the third place on the Liberal ticket in 2004 and as the last of the six senators from Queensland. His arrival, as the Leader of the Government has outlined, brought to this chamber a majority for the Howard government. It was the first time since 1980 and since the size of the Senate increased in 1984 that this had occurred. I recall that development; it was not a welcome development for those on this side of the chamber. However, we can be grateful that the Senate gained a learned member who had a reputation as a courteous and decent person as part of that change.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Russell Trood entered the Senate, in his own words, as someone who had 'received a good and some might even say excessive university education'. Born in Melbourne in 1948, his studies took him to New South Wales, the United Kingdom and Canada in pursuit of qualifications in law, strategic studies and international politics, including a doctorate. It was appointment to a position as a lecturer at Griffith University, via a stint at the Australian National University, that saw him finally settle in Queensland. I understand that Professor Trood's great grandfather had been a Queensland delegate for the 1891 Constitutional Convention and so, perhaps, this was something of a return. It was with some apparent delight that he told the Senate in his first speech that Queenslanders now outnumbered Victorians in the Liberal party room.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Professor Trood remained at Griffith until his election, advancing understanding of international relations with a particular focus on Asia and the Pacific. He was author, editor or contributor to over half a dozen books and a number of other publications. The focus of his work was international affairs in the Asia-Pacific. From 1990 to 2001 he served as director of the Centre for the Study of Australia-Asia Relations. He was an associate professor of international relations from 1997 to 2004 and a visiting fellow at the Lowy Institute from 2005.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Senator Claire Moore, also a Queenslander, enjoyed a good friendship with Professor Trood. She highlights 'his gifted and acclaimed work as an academic, particularly in international relations, which inspired many researchers and students because he was a great teacher as well as a researcher'. Senator Moore notes that 'he inspired students with a passion for constitutional law and governance, as well as economic relations'.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">With this background, it was no surprise that Russell Trood used his first speech to enunciate clear views on foreign policy and Australia's place in the world. He gave an intelligent assessment of Australia's view of the world that was to set the tone for his Senate career, which included service on the Foreign Affairs, Defence and Trade committees of both the Senate and the parliament; the Joint Standing Committee on Treaties; and the Parliamentary Joint Committee on Intelligence and Security, amongst others.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">He, in his first speech, remarked on the challenges and opportunities of globalisation, describing it as 'the phenomenon of our times'. He saw that amidst its contradictions, globalisation promoted an interdependent world, 'where countries and communities are increasingly interconnected'. His view was that Australia's response had to be engagement. For as much then as now, it is in our interest to, as he said, 'play an active and constructive role in world affairs'.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Professor Trood also reflected on the importance of education. He said: 'Ideas and education matter, not just for the prosperity they promise but because free and open societies depend on them.'</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Professor Trood also acknowledged the role of the Senate as a means of 'ensuring the accountability of the executive arm of government' whilst, in the context of a governing party majority of which he was part, noting that an enduring source of the Senate's political legitimacy is that it is popularly elected. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">It was these three elements—foreign policy, education and the institution of the Senate—that were to be dominant themes in Professor Trood's career as a senator. The journalist Matt Price reflected in <span style="font-style:italic;">The Australian</span> that:</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Small">Professor Trood entered the Senate at the same time as another more outspoken senator elected from Queensland in 2004.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Senator Brandis has spoken about this. Price described Professor Trood as 'the antithesis to' Senator Joyce, noting that Professor Trood 'embraces globalisation and supports most Coalition policies. He also noted that Professor Trood recognised his role as a senator was not just to represent Queenslanders, but to fulfil 'a national responsibility to govern for all Australians'—a duty all of us should maintain at the forefront of our work.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">In his post-political career, Professor Trood returned to work in academia and also for his country. He took up a professorship in international relations at Griffith University in addition to being appointed by the Gillard government to serve as Australia's special envoy to Eastern Europe, the Balkans and the Caucuses. He also held academic positions with the United States Studies Centre at the University of Sydney, sat on the board of the Australian American Fulbright Association and, in 2015, became director of the Griffith Asia Institute.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I wish to return briefly to Professor Trood's contribution to foreign policy. He had well developed views about our public diplomacy and engagement with our region. He believed Australia could confidently play our part on the diplomatic stage. To do so, in his view, we need only draw on our enduring strengths. I return to his first speech in the Senate because he identified the essence of this tradition to be: strong but not uncritical support for allies; robust bilateralism; a willingness to use military force when strategic necessity demands it; a respect for international law; an instinct for problem solving; and a commitment to effective and creative multilateralism. He characterised this as 'middle-power realism'.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Professor Trood's assessments were informed by a body of work that framed Australia's relationship with our nearest neighbours, our place in Asia and the Pacific, and our enduring alliance with the United States. He was fortunate to be writing at a time when significant geopolitical shifts were beginning to occur, and we are fortunate to benefit from his insights and analysis. He saw that East Asia was critically important to Australia's long-term future prosperity. He described himself as 'a long-time enthusiast for Australia's closer engagement with the region, noting that Australia must shed the 'mendicant mentality of a people transplanted from their European roots and desperate to discover an identity'. This was a statement about our ability to be 'clear-eyed about our national interests and confident that those interests are inextricably fused with the region's future.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">With China, he believed we could 'aspire to an increasingly constructive relationship across the full range of our political, economic and strategic interests', whilst also moving closer in our strategic partnerships with Japan. In South-East Asia, he recognised the mutual interests that are served by a 'healthy, expanding, cooperative relationship' between Australia and Indonesia. With India, he forecast how our relationship could be much deeper and broader than a shared interest in cricket and historical roots in the Commonwealth. Overall, he advocated for engagement with Asia as a national priority.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Professor Trood made his contribution to foreign policy as an academic and as a senator over more than three decades. South Australian Andrew Hunter recognised how Professor Trood 'contributed much understanding to international relations, including reflections on public diplomacy and middle-power diplomacy'. Mr Hunter particularly noted Professor Trood's warning that pragmatic, self-interested diplomacy about economic outcomes should not be the focus of Australia's international engagement. Foreign policy development in this country is richer for the contribution made by Professor Trood.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I noted earlier that a number of people in this chamber served as senators alongside Russell Trood. In excess of 30 senators, I understand, served concurrently with him. I know many will have their own personal memories on their encounters and experiences. I acknowledge the very moving speech by Senator Brandis. I also wish to thank Senator Moore for providing me with her kind and generous reflections. She told me how she enjoyed his intellect, and his quiet and sharp humour. She described an entertaining and cooperative team member who really loved his work in the Senate and appreciated the real value of committee work. These thoughts are consistent with those of many others who described Professor Trood as decent and courteous.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Russell Trood may have only served one term as a senator but his contribution to Australian and international public policy was much broader. With his untimely and sad passing, the nation is deprived of the continuing contribution of a servant who sought to expand our understanding of the region and our nation's place in the world. I again extend the opposition's deepest sympathies to his family and friends.</span>

                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Senator SCULLION</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Northern Territory</span>—<span class="HPS-MinisterialTitles">Minister for Indigenous Affairs and Leader of The Nationals in the Senate</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">16:41</span>):  I rise on behalf of the Nationals in this place to also extend condolences to the family of former Senator Russell Trood, who passed away earlier this year. Russell was a great mate of mine as he was a great mate of so many people in this place. I would also note that whilst he had arrived here quite some years after I had arrived, he played a bit of a mentor to me. In particular, he used to reflect on my behaviour from time to time and said he had arrived not a day too late. He was born in 1948 and completed his education at the University of Sydney before spending time studying abroad in both Wales and Canada. Indeed it was during this time that Russell penned one of his first letters to an editor in praise of Senate committees—a telling sign of what was to come.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Prior to his election to the Senate, Russell had a successful career as an academic. He was a professor of international relations at Griffith University, and served on the boards of numerous policy institutes in that field including the Australian Institute of International Affairs and the Australian Indonesia Institute.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I referred to him pretty much within a week of meeting him as 'Professor'. Many referred to him as 'Troody' or 'Professor'. We had an ongoing discussion during our friendship. I really thought that a professor was far more important than a senator—they let me be a senator but they would never be let me be something as important as a professor. He agreed and allowed that reference from that time on.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">As we have heard, Senator Trood's election to the final Senate position for Queensland at the 2004 half-Senate election was somewhat of a surprise given he was in the sixth position on the ticket. His election was very important as it gave the Howard Government a majority in both houses. But Russell was indeed a man of surprises. He brought to the Senate an unmatched knowledge of international relations, especially of East Asian affairs. This was reflected on by our Prime Minister, who recently described Russell as 'one of Australia's finest foreign policy minds' saying, 'Australia's relations with, and understanding of, our neighbours in the Asia Pacific have been enhanced by Russell's tireless efforts over many years.'</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Russell brought a wealth of knowledge and experience to this place, and I was always impressed by the wide range of topics he contributed on. I have to say, foreign affairs has never really been a background or a philosophy of mine and most of what I know about that area is as a courtesy of Russell invariably correcting some ill witted remark. He would take me aside and spend quite some time explaining exactly what was really happening, and some history.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I got most of my interest in foreign affairs, particularly in Asia, as a consequence of listening principally to some of Russell's corrections on those matters. From foreign policy to native title policy, which I was able to engage in with a little bit more vigour, I was very much the wiser for his counsel on these matters. He made some really meaningful contributions around the importance of mediation rather than forcing the claimants into courts. I think the way that we use the native title process—certainly, that advice—has been part of a strong legacy that he has left in the operational nature of legislation, as well as policy debate and discussion.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">As a strong supporter of the Australian Defence Force Parliamentary Program, I knew of his huge enjoyment and the experience he got out on HMAS <span style="font-style:italic;">Anzac</span> and HMAS <span style="font-style:italic;">Success</span>, as part of the RIMPAC exercises off Hawaii. You think you know Russell, when you first meet him—I used to think I had him boxed: professor, such an erudite man, such a knowledgeable man—but every time you saw him in another environment, it was another surprise. You could just see him on the deck of a destroyer, engaging with the crew as fluently and as easily as he would engage with his peers in this place—quite a remarkable communicator, and just had a way with people. He was very hardworking. He was always doing something. You would go and see him in his office and he always had time for you, but he was writing something or poring over some work. He was an incredibly hard worker, very courteous, well-liked and respected across the chamber.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">He was full of surprises. I look up somewhat nervously at the President, because he thinks I am probably going to tell this story—and I am. We were on a trip to Taiwan together—in fact, I think it was Senator Bernardi, Senator Parry, Senator Ferguson, myself and Senator Ronaldson. It was one of those moments in diplomacy where we were with the parliamentarians during the middle of the day, about to enter their equivalent of question time. It was a lunch, something had happened, they wanted to have a toast, and one of them had thrown down a very large glass of red wine followed by a little sort of short shot glass, and apparently that was to be consumed later. In any event, we picked those with the largest livers, so Senator Bernardi was sent in to bat and did something of a similar ilk, and Senator Parry, and then myself. That was all part of this diplomatic exchange, and there was a bit of ho-humming, as normally happens in those matters, and then, of course, we thought, 'Oh well, here's Senator Trood—he's a professor; he's last, you know, poor thing.' And so he has just taken a sip out of the glass of wine and then replaced it, and everyone said, 'Oh look, no, no—you're supposed to scull it.' So he then had measured the amount he had taken perfectly, and poured this evil spirit into it and then threw the whole thing down, to much applause and gusto, because he was the most unlikely looking person to have been able to evidence that sort of behaviour.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">But in that room, part of what I thought about was not only the laughter—everybody knew him. They did not know who I was, they did not know who, I am sure, the President was, or Bernardi, but everybody knew who Russell was. No matter where you went, he always had this great affection for people. People actually knew who he was. Not only was he a senator, he was also Russell Trood.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">When we lost him to this place, which was very sad, it was a great loss to public affairs. He continued in public affairs when he finished here. In 2012 he completed an appointment as the Special Envoy of the Prime Minister of Australia for Eastern Europe. During this time he also became the United Nations Association of Australia National President, and Director of the Griffith Asia Institute, where he encouraged better relations between Australia and Asia-Pacific countries. He will be remembered as a senator, a scholar, a diplomat who served this country and made a lasting and distinguished contribution to public affairs, particularly in his specialist field of international relations. We in parliament, and the wider community, have all lost a valued friend and esteemed colleague, and Australia is better for his public service. So on behalf of the Nationals, and this place more broadly, I pass on our condolences and thoughts to Professor Trood's family, his devoted wife, Dale, his children, James and Phoebe, and to his many friends. We will miss you. Vale Russell Trood.</span>

It is not very often that I would say this, but I genuinely think that he was a significant loss to this chamber. It is not often I say that about people from the other side, but I think he was a genuine loss to the Senate, given the depth of his knowledge and understanding and his personal contributions.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I am speaking on behalf of the Greens because we were part of the class of 2004. Every senator in this place knows what it is like be part of the class that comes in. You become closer to those people in the class than some of the other senators, because when you come in we all know you go to Senate school. You all share in the same experiences, but Senate school was a great leveller. You are all newbies, you are all coming in, and you think you understand how this place operates, but you really do not until you are actually here, so we shared those same learning experiences. I can still sit here and remember seeing Senator Trood smiling across the chamber at some joke that had been made, some witticism that had been made, and he genuinely had a smile that lit up his face, and you thought, 'Oh, actually, if Russell's smiling at that, it must've been pretty witty or pretty funny,' and sometimes, of course, you would not hear what was said on the other side, but you would know something had been said.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Senator Brandis in particular, but also Senator Wong, outlined his enormous lifelong contribution to public debate, his outstanding achievements which he brought to this place. He did not big-note himself. It was through his words and his participation and work that you understood the depth of his knowledge and contribution. As I said, I think his loss to this place was significant. His loss, in terms of his contribution on international relations and foreign policy, is significant to Australia but in particular to this place. And I think in this time that we are facing at the moment his loss will be felt because that measured, deep understanding of foreign policy and international relations will not be there to be part of the debate.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">While I did not always agree with the comments he made, I did genuinely listen and appreciate his contribution. It made you sit and think about what he was saying. He did it in a dignified, courteous—as has been said—manner. And I think he was what my mother would say was a true gentleman. He made very significant contributions to this place in a way that many others do not. Some of us are louder, more raucous, myself included. But he had his own way of getting his point across very effectively. It was a sad loss when he left the Senate. It is now a sad loss that he has passed on at such a young age. Vale Russell Trood. On behalf of the Greens, I also would like to express our condolences.</span>

                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Senator BIRMINGHAM</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">South Australia</span>—<span class="HPS-MinisterialTitles">Minister for Education and Training</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">16:53</span>):  I rise to associate myself particularly with the remarks of Senator Brandis but also with those of Senator Wong, Senator Scullion and Senator Siewert in relation to the late Russell Trood. And as I commence I acknowledge former senator Brett Mason, who I note has entered the public gallery during the course of this condolence motion and of course, as Senator Brandis rightly acknowledged, was one of the trifecta of Liberal senators elected successfully at that 2004 election that brought Senator Trood ultimately to this parliament.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Russell was I would say twice in my parliamentary life something of a mentor to me. Upon my election to this place in 2007, when I entered here as a 32-year-old senator, Russell, with just two years under his belt here but much more life experience—a 58-year-old senator—I think took me as something of a student and a project of his for a period of time. I am forever grateful for the time we had sitting next to one another on the opposition benches as we did for a period of time, and the various lessons that, in his way, he managed to share with me during that time—always calm, knowledgeable, dignified, considered, helpful and constructive in his approach. He certainly drilled me in the most gentle and thoughtful of ways in ensuring that I did my research, knew my brief and tried to adopt a constructive approach to the way I went about my politics. Certainly that was the way he went about his politics.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">But it was not just in those early years of my time here that Russell provided that type of role and mentoring. It was subsequent to my appointment to the ministry, after Russell had left this Senate. But of course, as others have reflected, education was one of Russell's great public policy passions, as a professor and academic researcher. It is a subject about which he was intensely knowledgeable. So, there were numerous occasions following my appointment firstly as assistant minister with responsibility for vocational education, about which Russell also spoke in his first speech, and then my appointment to the cabinet as the minister for education where I valued meeting with and discussing with Russell different aspects of education policy and the challenges that I have sought to confront in that space.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">And I will greatly miss his wise counsel and knowledge and knowing that I had a trusted confidant at the other end of the phone with whom I could discuss some of those difficult issues and who would understand them. Russell was always—always—a friend and one you could trust completely, with absolute confidence, I found. And that of course is not always something that in this place we can say with such a degree of confidence and in such an absolute sense. On a day like today, a day of political disruption, I will say that I know that Russell did note in his valedictory speech that he himself saw some tumultuous times in his six years in the Senate, and there have been a few tumultuous times in the years since Russell left this place. He did note that they were tumultuous times, and on a day like today it would not have been at all uncommon for us to share a quiet glass of red wine with the odd other trusted colleague to discuss what it meant, what the implications were. Again, Russell would always bring a calm, thoughtful and considered approach to that but also a principled one, one that brought his views, his values, his belief in liberalism to the approach that he believed that we as a party needed to take into the future.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Many have spoken about Russell's contribution outside this place and his contribution in this place, particularly to foreign policy, and I will not repeat those words. I do want to highlight one other area of contribution that I believe deserves praise and recognition, and that is passing his final work in this place, which was as chair of the Senate Select Committee on the Federation and the significant report he produced, into which he put much effort, time and consideration and about which he spoke in his valedictory speech. In doing so, he highlighted the drift from what the founding fathers, one of whom was his great-grandfather, had set in place in the Constitution around the sharing of responsibilities. As with all of Russell's contributions, it was well researched, it was well considered. It provides advice and reference that we would perhaps all do well to go and look up and reconsider some of the thoughts and recommendations that Russell and his colleagues made in that report about how our federation can work more effectively into the future.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">When Russell left this Senate I spoke to that valedictory motion about Russell and the other senators who left the Senate at the same time. I went back and had a look at my remarks, and for each of the senators I gave a quote. In the case of Russell, it was from a lesser-known 20th-century American writer, Carson McCullers:</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Small">There's nothing that makes you so aware of the improvisation of human existence as a song unfinished.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">At the time, I said:</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Small">Russell is perhaps not a song unfinished so much as a book unfinished—a great classic novel—whose intelligence, capacity and knowledge deserve to be in this place longer and should be making a longer contribution.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Sadly, Russell left this place all too soon for somebody who could have made a much greater contribution, and he passed away all too soon for somebody who was still, through his work, making a significant contribution to public policy, to public life, to life in Queensland in particular and to life around the world. I was saddened greatly by his loss. I treasured the last few conversations I had with him over the last six months. I was terribly sorry not to be able to be at the recent service that commemorated Russell's life, but in this place, as I have also done personally, I add my condolences to his family, Dale, James and Phoebe, and record the enormous contribution made by a very significant person. I will always treasure his contribution not only here but also to my work in this place.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Queensland</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">17:00</span>):  I would like to say a few words on behalf of my One Nation colleagues today with reference to the condolence motion for Russell Trood, a former Queensland senator. While I did not know the late former Senator Trood, I have been told he was a fine gentleman who served the state of Queensland and his country well. An adviser who works in one of my senator's offices did know him and tells me he had a great love of children and animals. He was a man who placed the interests of Australians first and disliked political correctness in all forms. Another of my advisers who had dealings with the former senator said Mr Trood was a true gentleman who was always calm and who approached matters in the most considered and intellectual way. It is clear from the words of others today and from my advisers who knew him that he was well liked and well respected. He possessed a civility that is sorely lacking in today's political landscape. Apparently he was up against me in the 2004 election in Queensland. Although I am not really happy about losing my bid for the Senate at that time, in light of what I have learnt about this man today, if my preferences went to getting him elected I do not feel so bad. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">From the words that have been said today, Mr Trood was very highly regarded and respected. Maybe we would have agreed on quite a bit, maybe we would have been at loggerheads and maybe he would have given me very good advice on the role that I now hold today. On behalf of Pauline Hanson's One Nation and my fellow colleagues, I would like to pass on my thoughts and prayers to his family and to his close friends and colleagues. It is a difficult time for you all.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Queensland</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">17:02</span>):  I also want to place on record my admiration for my friend and Queensland Liberal colleague Russell Trood, and express my sadness at his untimely passing. It is always difficult in these condolence motions to follow speakers of eloquence like my leader, George Brandis. George made a wonderful speech at the memorial service last Friday, which I was privileged to attend. Not only was George's speech so eloquent; it was so personal. I know George and Russell were very close colleagues, friends and confidants and, perhaps at times, conspirators in the rough-and-tumble of Queensland Liberal politics in those days. Curiously, just before Christmas I was cleaning out a drawer and I came across a slip of paper in a pair of trousers that I obviously had not worn for several years. On it there was a how-to-vote ticket with Russell Trood's name on it. His name was in a group in bold, and I do not think that was the group I was actually supporting at the time. It was an internal how-to-vote card that I had picked up from someone else.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I always thought that I was a far better politician than Russell was, but, without doubt, he was a far better parliamentarian than I was. I enjoyed Russell's company but was sometimes overawed by it. My case on an argument is one line and perhaps raising my voice, so it was always difficult with Russell—he always spoke softly, but always had an argument and the facts and the knowledge that made it very difficult to interact socially.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Mr President, at the memorial service on Friday—and this is about Russell, not about people here—your contribution was also so moving and accurate. The contribution from our former colleague Michael Ronaldson was also very appropriate. In my own very limited way, I want to pay my respects and offer my condolences. I particularly remember Russell in the 2004 election campaign, which George and Brett Mason and Russell ran. They travelled all around the state of Queensland, and, on occasions, senators not up for election travelled with them. I know how close George, Brett and Russell became during the campaign. I was delighted to always make sure Russell was introduced as the senator who actually gave the majority to the Howard government at that time. There was another senator from another political party who—sometimes inadvertently, I am sure—used to claim that credit, but it was actually Russell Trood who did the hard yards, did the nail-biting at the end of the count and actually gave the Howard government that quite unique win in the 2004 election. It is unique, and Russell was very much a part of it. I was not directly involved myself, but I know that he and George and Brett would have been agonising over the strategy and getting the then Prime Minister to write that letter. Russell would have been a very great contributor to that most momentous and exceptional event in the political history of Australia.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Others have related stories and made comments that I will not even try to repeat or better, other than to say that I agree with them all. It is sad that I lived in the north of Queensland, not in Brisbane, so I did not see a lot of Russell, but we made contact just a couple of months before his sickness was diagnosed. He came to see me about a matter related to the live cattle exports ban and particularly the Indonesian element of that. He was very involved with Indonesian activities—with the Australia-Indonesia Institute, with the relationship between Australia and Indonesia. I am sure that if he had not got sick that would have been an area where he would have extended his already high knowledge and involvement—all for the good of Australia and Indonesia.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">To Russell, I say rest in peace, and to Dale, Phoebe and James, I extend to you my condolences and those of my wife, Lesley.</span>

                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Senator FIFIELD</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Victoria</span>—<span class="HPS-MinisterialTitles">Manager of Government Business in the Senate, Minister for Communications and Minister for the Arts</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">17:08</span>):  I rise to associate myself with the contributions of colleagues, and by the number of contributions that have been made it is clear that Russell Trood touched a lot of people and that there was a great deal of affection for him. When I first arrived in this place in 2004 I was sat on my own—I thought someone was trying to send me a message. Fortunately, not long after I arrived here Russell Trood was sat next to me. We were bench buddies for a number of years. We got on fabulously. From time to time people are moved around this chamber, but Russell and I entered a pact—no reflection on our colleagues, but we said that we were happy to sit anywhere in this chamber as long as we were sitting together. That served us very well. I could not have wished for a more agreeable colleague to spend time with. That period as bench buddies is a time of my life that I will always look back on with great fondness.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Russell and I did not always agree on issues. We took different sides in the VSU debate; in leadership ballots sometimes we were voting together and sometimes we were not. With Russell you could always have a good and civil discussion, probing the reasons for each other's thoughts, but never was there even the slightest degree of tension—there was always a great deal of respect. One of the marks of Russell was that you could debate anything with him, take any position, and the friendship would only be stronger as a result of that interaction. Some of us in this place did on occasion refer to Russell as 'Red Russell' because he was moderate in outlook as well as temperament. That was a little unfair to Russell, because he was fairly and squarely in the mainstream of the liberal tradition. A number of colleagues have said, and I agree, that Russell was the model of a senator. He was the sort of person that I think the voting public would like to think occupies this chamber. He was, as we all know, thoughtful, deliberative and widely read. He had a passion for good policy. He was curious, inquiring and independent of mind. He always had a dignity about him, and his contributions were of such a quality that it always made you want to be a better senator and a better contributor in this place yourself.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">When I spoke in the valedictory address in 2011 when Russell was leaving us I said that it was my hope that Russell's absence from this place would prove to be, in line with his academic heritage, a mere sabbatical. Unfortunately that was not the case, and I think the Senate was the poorer for his absence and for the fact that the opportunity for him to return did not present itself. But Russell did continue to make an important contribution in public policy. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The longer we spend in this place and the more we work with colleagues, and particularly those with whom we have become close and have an affection, when they leave this place a little part of you leaves with them. It is comforting to ponder that hopefully they have appreciated taking a little bit of each of us with them, and I hope that was the case with Russell. We miss him; he should be remembered as one of the substantial figures of the Australian Senate. Russell and Russell's family are very much in my thoughts and in the thought of all of us at this time.</span>

Unlike many in this chamber, I did not know Senator Trood as well as them, but I had become friendly with Russell as he was a former senator for Queensland. I was not even involved in politics in a serious way when Senator Trood was elected to this place in 2004, but I was fortunate enough to be there in the sequel, the re-election campaign in 2010. I distinctly remember first meeting Russell in the Criterion Hotel in Rockhampton during the 2010 election. Senator Brandis was there that evening. Former senator Mason was there that evening. Current MP Barnaby Joyce was there at that dinner. They were all at that dinner seeking to get re-elected at that time under a unified LNP banner. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">There were some pretty large and loud personalities there in that room—I am not looking at you, former senator Brett Mason—but it was Russell Trood that I gravitated to that evening. I felt he had such a magnetic personality. He was such a gentleman. I was just a new starter, but he was very engaging with me. He had this way about him, almost a magical way of attracting people to him in a way that you could not but appreciate and find welcoming. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">It was very clear, speaking to him, what a well-read and intelligent person he was. I did not realise how smart he was until I heard Senator Brandis mention that he realised he should not pursue a career in the law and go and do other more productive things with himself, which he did. He certainly did, and we very much miss his contribution in this nation now. As others have suggested, he made just as much, if not a greater, contribution outside this place as in it. He would be a very valuable voice in the world right now in favour of openness and the importance of international relations and a strong voice in favour of our country being an active and engaging participant in our region.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I was looking forward to catching up with former senator Trood last year, when I spoke at a Griffith Asia Institute function. It was only then that I realised the gravity of his illness. It was very sad to hear about, because he certainly had a lot to give and was giving a lot through that institute. To Dr Kathleen Turner and her team at the Griffith Asia Institute I express my deep condolences. I am sure that Russell Trood's legacy will live on through that institute. Its work is continuing and, I suggest, is even more important now than perhaps it was a few years ago.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We could also use Russell in other ways. As Senator Hanson mentioned, he did actually beat Pauline Hanson and One Nation. We could certainly use those talents as well, but we will have to persist without his experience, his guidance and his good nature. My deep condolences go to Russell's family and I pass on all our sympathy to them and hope that they get some solace from the contribution that he has made in this place and the number of lives he has touched through the work he has done here and elsewhere.</span>

I did not serve with Russell, but I was the campaign director in 2010 who failed to see get him re-elected—a failure which, I am happy to report, he did not hold against me personally. Looking up at former senator Mason there, in relation to the story of the preferences from the Sex Party, which has become either the truth or an urban myth about how we got Senator Mason over the line, I wish that perhaps the Sex Party had got more votes and we could have got Russell Trood over the line.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Russell was a great servant not just to the Liberal National Party and the former Liberal Party, which he served a branch chair, but to the public at large. More importantly, he was a great servant to thinking. He was one of those rare creatures in this zoo—someone who actually thought before he spoke. Sometimes when I speak I wish I had his patience to slow down my tongue so my thoughts manage to catch up with me.</span>

                  </a>  I think Senator Williams is seconding that motion. I had the privilege, and it was a privilege, of going to the Queensland Conservatorium of Music last Friday and listening to some great speeches honouring Russell Trood, sitting there with his family and friends, his former staff and party stalwarts. I was trying to remember the first time I met Russell. It was in 2009. I had waddled out to his office in Springwood. I went in there, and being a campaign director I was talking about what we needed to do. He had all these books. I remember sitting there looking at all these books and thinking, 'I wonder if he has read all these books.' I was thinking, 'This is actually what I think a senator is.' I had not met a senator before. 'Lots of books—this is pretty cool!' He was an unabashed intellectual. I think sometimes in Australia we do have a race to the bottom, but it is good when you have people like Russell Trood who are not just a speed bump or handbrake, but try to turn the car around and take us back up in the pursuit of intellectual honesty.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">He was a liberal with the moderate views of the broad church that is the Liberal National Party. He was decent, he was honest, he had an evil sense of humour and a twinkle in his eye when he was trying to tell a story or listening to someone tell an even better story. His departure from this place in 2011 was a loss to parliament, but his death last month is a loss to all of us, whether family, friend or foe.</span>

Like your good self, Mr President, Senator Siewert and myself are the class of 2004, that dynamic bunch of new entrants back then. Russell was in our gang. Russell was an absolute gentleman. We can have some argy-bargy across this chamber and we can really get stuck into each other, but Russell was the sort of senator who never had a bad word to say about anyone—not to our faces anyway; I do not know what he said about us while having a beer with George or Brett. It is good to see you too, Brett. From my own personal feelings towards Russell, I miss you, mate. You were exemplary in your behaviour in this chamber. I have to say that if the other 75 of us conducted ourselves like you did, Russell, there would be nothing to talk about in question time. All the very best to his family.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Time">17:21</span>):  Thank you, Senator Sterle. Just in summing up, it would be remiss of me not to make some very brief comments. I associate myself with all the remarks and fine contributions this afternoon in honouring a dear colleague. It is great to have His Excellency, former Senator Brett Mason, Ambassador to the Netherlands here, who was such a big part of the campaign. So, welcome, Your Excellency. </span>

When you do come in, as Senator Siewert and Senator Sterle mentioned, in the same class of 2004, you do have a common bond that lasts throughout your entire Senate career. We do miss him from that perspective. We have lost certainly a great gentleman and a great contributor to debate, and intellectual debate in particular, in this place. But his family have lost him now as a father, as a husband, as a brother and as a good friend to many people in Queensland. </span>

                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">Mr President, I thank the Senate for the opportunity to introduce the Australian Human Rights Commission Amendment (Preliminary Assessment Process) Bill 2017. The purpose of the Bill is to make a change to the complaints handling procedure of the Australian Human Rights Commission. Before proceeding to a full inquiry and attempt at reconciliation, the Commission will now be required to contact both the complainant and the respondent or respondents, and consider any evidence that they provide for a preliminary assessment of the case. If the complaint is lacking in substance or otherwise unworthy, it can be terminated at that point. I contend that the work of the Commission is seriously impeded by cases involving alternative facts and unreliable evidence, adding unnecessarily to its workload, and involving people falsely accused of discrimination in serious damage to their reputations and causing them untold expense.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">Briefly, the change to the Commission's complaints handling procedure is achieved by removing subsection 46PF(1) of the <span style="font-style:italic;">Australian Human Rights Commission Act 1986 </span>and replacing it with new provisions to require the President of the Commission to appoint a committee to make a preliminary assessment of every referred complaint. The committee will consist of the President and two other members of the Commission. Complainants will be informed of the proposed preliminary assessment of their complaint and they will be invited to provide further information for the complaint. After receiving the information, the committee may form the view that the complaint should be terminated, or that one or more respondents should be removed from the complaint.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">The committee will then proceed to notify both the complainant and the respondent or respondents that an inquiry will be conducted into the complaint by way of a preliminary assessment. At the same time, the respondent or respondents will be invited to provide evidence in relation to the complaint for the purposes of the preliminary assessment. Once the evidence is received from the parties, the committee will consider the complaint and decide whether it could be terminated, or whether one or more respondents should be removed from the complaint. A decision to remove a respondent or respondents will be notified to the complainant by the President in the form of a recommendation with reasons. If the complainant does not withdraw the complaint or remove a respondent or respondents at this point, the President will notify an intention to inquire into the complaint and attempt to conciliate it. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">Mr President, I emphasise that the preliminary assessment procedure contemplated by the Bill before the Senate is not intended to mandate that the complainant withdraw the complaint in the event of an adverse finding by the committee. But a decision of the preliminary assessment committee against the complainant could result in the President making a decision under subsection 46PH of the <span style="font-style:italic;">Australian Human Rights Commission Act 1986 </span>to terminate the complaint. By way of contrast, if the committee decides that a respondent or respondents should be removed from the proceedings, a recommendation to that effect will follow, but ultimately the issue of removing one or more respondents is a matter for the complainant. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">The preliminary assessment procedure is not intended to deny a complainant their day in court as it were, but any decision of the committee will necessarily inform the proceedings and in effect add to the burden of proof required of the complainant. It would be a brave complainant who proceeded with a complaint against a respondent or respondents who the President recommended should be removed from a proceeding. I would not presume to give gratuitous legal advice to such a complainant, Mr President, but it may be that a complainant who proceeded with a complaint against a respondent or respondents in the face of a recommendation of the Human Rights Commission that one or more of those respondents should be removed from the proceeding may well be in the unenviable position of losing qualified privilege as a defence under the uniform defamation law.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">I turn now to the need for the Australian Human Rights Commission Amendment (Preliminary Assessment Process) Bill 2017, and I take the opportunity to mention the excellent work of the current inquiry by the Parliamentary Joint Committee on Human Rights which is examining certain procedures of the Australian Human Rights Commission. I am unable to say with any certainty whether my notice of the preliminary assessment process bill was drawn before or after the terms of reference for the inquiry were announced. What I can say is that I had no idea the committee intended reviewing the procedures of the Commission. Be that as it may, a large number of submissions to the inquiry have drawn attention to the risk of respondents being dragged before the commission to answer spurious allegations that severely impact their reputations and wallets. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">Last week at a public hearing of the committee in Sydney, Dr Sev Ozdowski, OAM, a former Australian Human Rights Commissioner, gave evidence that people at the Human Rights Commission like to "enforce their vision of the world" implying collateral damage to unwitting respondents who find they must justify words and actions that, in normal circumstances, would be well within the bounds of free speech. Dr Ozdowski had no hesitation in asserting to the committee that the complaints handling procedure at the Human Rights Commission "is biased in favour of the person making the complaint." The former commissioner also made the point that recent high profile cases such as complaints about Queensland University of Technology students and cartoonist Bill Leak have focused public attention on the Commission in a positive way from a public accountability perspective.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">At the same hearings last week in Sydney, the eminent jurist and former judge, Justice Ronald Sackville, AO, QC, gave evidence that he would like to see a more stringent merits assessment test applied at an early stage in proceedings before the Australian Human Rights Commission. The judge was asked about the risks to the law of being brought into disrepute by unworthy cases receiving too much attention at the Commission. Mr President, may I quote Justice Sackville's response: "I am a proponent of early termination of cases that are without merit…(I)f the mechanisms within the Human Rights Commission for example, were changed so as to allow early termination much more readily, or to compel it much more readily, that would mitigate the risk [of bringing the law into disrepute]." </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">In making a case for changing the complaints handling procedure at the Human Rights Commission, Mr President, I would like to reflect on the unusual circumstances in which the Commission in its present form came into existence in late 1986. A year earlier, in November 1985, the Hawke Labor government introduced and passed in the House of Representatives the <span style="font-style:italic;">Human Rights and Equal Opportunity Commission Bill 1985 (HREOC) </span>along with the <span style="font-style:italic;">Australian Bill of Rights Bill 1985</span>. They were concurrent bills, the plan being that HREOC would be the enforcement mechanism for what was to be Australia's first statutory Bill of Rights. Bob Hawke thought he had all his ducks lined up in the Senate, but then there was a problem for which former independent Senator Brian Harradine is sometimes unjustly held responsible. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">A joint debate on the Bill of Rights Bill and the HREOC Bill took place in the Senate in early 1986. According to former Prime Minister Gough Whitlam, debate on the Bill of Rights Bill in the Senate was hijacked by the Labor Premier of Western Australia, Brian Burke, who informed Bob Hawke that there would be no money for head office of the Labor Party from Labor's supporters in the west if the Bill of Rights Bill went ahead since the provision for one vote one value in the Bill would put an end to Labor's gerrymander in the Western Australia Parliament. Hawke's government abandoned the Bill of Rights Bill in April 1986 while the HREOC legislation was held over until later in the year. The HREOC Bill was amended to remove all reference to the Australian Bill of Rights Bill – a considerable task given its primary objective was to provide the enforcement mechanism for the rights Bill. A severely mauled HREOC Bill became law in November 1986. The Commission thus established, I would say, was condemned to a role in Australia's justice system as a watchdog with no teeth. Others say the Commission (officially called the Australian Human Rights Commission since 2009) has been trying to justify its existence from the moment of its birth in 1986 with the stillborn Australian Bill of Rights. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">People from across the political spectrum in Australia believe our legal system is the poorer for not having a bill of rights either in statutory or constitutional form. Surveys consistently show that once it is explained that a bill of rights is a line in the sand against tyrannical governments and has nothing to do with the rights of one person against another, support for a bill of rights increases dramatically. There are many people in the Pauline Hanson One Nation Party who argue passionately for a bill of rights as there are in other minor parties and in the major parties. In my opinion, the absence of a bill of rights at a federal level in Australia's legal system is like a deep hole we seem to have fallen in and we are unlikely to have any chance of achieving important goals such as legal equality and access to justice until as a nation we take the first important step to climb out of the hole by legislating a statutory bill of rights or human rights charter.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">Meanwhile, Mr President, we have to live with the survivor of that difficult birth in 1986, the Australian Human Rights Commission. The Commission's role today is complicated by its history, but for many Australians it represents a lifeline to justice for alleged acts of discrimination that would otherwise go unpunished. And the deterrent element in a decision of the Commission has immeasurable importance for a person aggrieved by discrimination. I would not want to diminish in any way the valuable work of the Commission in allowing complainants the opportunity to conciliate their concerns before taking on the battleground of the courts system. If the Commission is unable to conciliate a complaint, the complainant has no forum for litigation other than the courts, and this could be another issue for the current Parliamentary inquiry. Should the Commission be given a quasi-judicial function rather than have the complainant litigate the same facts and supporting evidence that the Commission has already considered? </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">That is a question for another day, Mr President, and I'm pleased to inform the Senate that the Bill now before the Senate is a much more modest proposal. The Bill allows the Commission to conduct a preliminary assessment of the merits of a complaint at an early stage in the proceeding with a view to weeding out unmeritorious complaints. Of the 2,013 complaints dealt with by the Commission in the year to 30 June 2016, more than 75 per cent were successfully conciliated, suggesting there are about 500 complaints that might benefit from the new system. Some cases will involve allegations of self-evident and egregious discrimination, of course, but others will be minor matters that could never justify the reputational and monetary damage caused to innocent respondents, and these are the cases the Bill is targeting. I commend the Australian Human Rights Commission Amendment (Preliminary Assessment Process) Bill 2017 to the Senate.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Western Australia</span>—<span class="HPS-MinisterialTitles">Australian Greens Whip</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">17:32</span>):  I rise to convince the Senate that the government's disastrous and inaccurate automated debt recovery process, and its refusal to abandon the system, is a great matter of importance. I also rise to convince the Senate to support that particular contention. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The Turnbull government's disastrous and inaccurate automated debt recovery system has resulted in misery, concern, frustration and anger for a great many Australians. While it may be a new year in parliament, we see no change in the government's ongoing attack on Australians relying on the social safety net. Many of us here in this chamber were lucky enough to have time off with family, friends and loved ones over the holiday period. However, many Australians—who are not represented here today but who we are supposed to be representing—were not so fortunate. The Christmas holiday period is already stressful for many Australians who do not have a high and significant income. It brings on issues of ongoing financial stress and affects people's mental health, and this is reflected in the statistics. But during this time, which is stressful for many vulnerable low-income Australians, the government chose to launch its worst attack of late on income support recipients. It is certainly the worst attack and the worst-timed attack that I have seen during my time in parliament—and I have seen many attacks during that time.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I know that many Australians save all year to enjoy the Christmas period with their families and to make sure that their children have an enjoyable time. Yet, due to the actions of this government, many Australians have been in a state of panic and distress about the debt notices that they have been receiving, demanding payments of thousands and sometimes tens of thousands of dollars, without explanation, just days before Christmas. The government may play around with some of the words around the debt notices, but, when they got those letters, that is how people read them—as debt notices. Recipients of these notices were, and are continuing to be, assumed guilty. They are directed to start making payments virtually immediately or to prove that they have made the correct reports through providing pay slips from, in some cases, many years ago—sometimes where businesses are no longer operating—despite the Centrelink website advising until recently that they only needed to keep pay slips for six months. Who in this place still has pay slips from previous jobs, jobs from five or six years ago? When people have attempted to do that, they have been directed to talk to Centrelink, but it is nearly impossible to get hold of Centrelink via phone or online. Try using the myGov website to resolve a situation, particularly when you are frustrated and scared about these debt notices. Many people have told me about the long waiting times, and I have talked about those waiting times in this place on numerous occasions. The government's response was, 'You can phone Centrelink,' and they say the average waiting time is a relatively short amount of time. It is not. If you have tried, you know that it takes a very long time to get through to Centrelink. In fact, people have been sending me screenshots from their phones showing how long they have spent waiting on the line, trying to get through to Centrelink. Because of troubles with the system—there were 29 million missed calls last financial year—we know that the fundamentals of the system are flawed.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I have heard many accounts of the flaws that are occurring, so let me talk about a few. They have been averaging out the wages that somebody has earned over a year, matching it to Centrelink or ATO records for the year and then saying that the debt is owed. There are varying types of records that are being matched up by the computer. This is a recipe for disaster, as the records simply cannot be properly matched, as we have seen. Payments have been averaged out that were short-term and have then been calculated over a period of a year when the person was not, in fact, employed for the whole year.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I have also heard of school teachers on short contracts receiving debt notices of over $10,000 because the automated system has not recognised that the payslips they received with the name of the school on them at which they teach were in fact the same records as those the ATO had saying 'Department of Education'. So the system has assumed there were two different incomes there and, therefore, said to teachers, 'You owe a debt.' This is from the system that the government was trying to defend during question time, saying that it was working fine. How could it be working fine when one wage is being counted twice because the system does not recognise different names for the same employer! I have heard people have received debt notices saying that they owe $10,000 for overpayment while on WorkCover. And people are having to fly interstate—this is one of the accounts that have I got—to try and retrieve documents from five years ago. And then they cannot be uploaded to the Centrelink website!</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Many people have started paying debts despite having records to prove that they have been paid correctly simply because: they cannot get into contact with Centrelink; their internal review is taking so long that they do not want to be opening a door to a debt collector; they are scared—they get these notices and they are scared; and/or they cannot access their records. And, so, they start paying.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Some overpayment notices have been out for quite a while. In fact, people have now contacted me saying, 'I've started paying this debt because they thought they must be right. I thought they were wrong but I thought I must have done something wrong.' It was not until they started hearing all the other people getting errors in debt notices that they realised something was wrong.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I have been contacted by Centrelink workers who have told us that even when the paperwork has been uploaded as requested it simply sits there as there is no-one to process it, and people's erroneous remains and gets sent to the debt collectors. Those on the inside say that delays in processing are literally getting longer by the day to the extent that things are getting completely out of control.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Some of the so-called overpayments are a result of system or administrative errors by Centrelink. When I asked a question on notice about this—Centrelink does not even count, the department does not count, the number of errors that they have made. So we have no idea how many of these so-called overpayments are a result of errors by the agency. And then, even when they do identify that it is as a result of an error by the agency, there is no grace period for people. It is not their fault that they have been overpaid. All of these are problems with the automated system creating debts that people do not, in fact, have. The government is so focused on trying to undermine our social safety net. They are so anxious to put blame and to victimise vulnerable Australians that rely on our social safety net when they are letting people get away with millions and millions of dollars in tax avoidance. They are negotiating with people that owe millions and millions of dollars, and letting them off millions of dollars. Yet, they are chasing the most vulnerable members of our community with a system that is totally flawed and that needs to be abandoned.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Government senators are trying to stand here in this place today and defend a flawed system which is having a direct impact on people's lives. The system ruined people's Christmas. People are stressed. It has resulted in mental health. We are getting phone calls into my office with people that talk about taking their own lives as a result of this process. We of course have been referring them on to the appropriate advice, such as through Lifeline. But when you get to a situation where people are talking about literally taking their own lives—they are scared witless about how they are going to pay the bills; you could open a bill and see a debt for $10,000—this system is broken. It needs to be abandoned. They need to scrap it now.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">
                  <a href="F49" type="MemberSpeech">
                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Senator CAROL BROWN</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Tasmania</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">17:42</span>):  I, too, rise to speak on this MPI about the Centrelink debt recovery debacle. It has absolutely been a debacle. The start of the year has been marked by many failures from this government, but none have had a greater impact on so many vulnerable people than the Centrelink debt recovery debacle. By any measure, it has been an epic failure.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">What is most concerning about this debacle is the trauma that has been inflicted on thousands of Australians on low and fixed incomes who have done nothing wrong other than to access the support that they are entitled to. To receive a debt recovery notice with virtually no explanation of the circumstances surrounding the alleged debt would be shocking for anyone. But for people on low and fixed incomes this sort of notice from the Australian government agency can be devastating.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We have to have a look at exactly what has happened. We are talking about people that have accessed Centrelink—whether they have at one time been students who have then moved into paid work, casual workers that have been supplemented by Centrelink payments who have then moved into a higher paid job, or pensioners or others that receive a Centrelink payment that have also supplemented their income through paid work. So we are talking about people who have had paid work, had jobs and have, most likely, paid some income tax. This is what we are talking about. We are talking about the ATO and the Centrelink records being married up together. But they are two systems that are completely different. This system that has been put into place, the Centrelink system, does not match the ATO system. The requirements of the Centrelink system do not match those of the ATO system. What has happened is a fundamental failure of this government to protect its own people. That is what has happened. We have heard here today, and also during question time, stories about people who have thousands and thousands of dollars worth of debt notices that have not been correct. We have heard today that up to 40 per cent of debt notices have been incorrect. Seriously, that needs to be fixed. The government needs to suspend its issuing of debt notices, see what the issues are and fix them. Because until it does that it is putting upon its own people stress, distress and an absolute inability to pay debts that they do not actually owe.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">In Hobart a rally was organised by a northern suburbs community action group, and many people turned up to express their anger. The following day we had the honour of having Linda Burney, the shadow minister for human services, come down and talk to people who have had debt notices sent to them. In Tasmania we have heard many people who have received incorrect notices. We have also had every single Liberal senator from Tasmania say, 'There's a problem.' Senator Abetz has been on the radio saying, 'There's a problem. Let's fix it'. We have had not only the Premier of Tasmania but the Minister for Human Services in Tasmania saying, 'Stop what you're doing. It's wrong. It's not working. You're targeting people with incorrect debt notices. Stop it now.'</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">There are consequences of these debt notices for people: they are being sent to debt collectors. That means they now have a bad credit rating that is not of their own making. That is what is happening. Stop pretending. Do not stand up and protect the government. It is wrong. Think about the people that you represent in your home states. It has to be suspended and it has to be suspended now. <span style="font-style:italic;">(Time expired)</span></span>

                  <a href="266499" type="MemberSpeech">
                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Senator HUME</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Victoria</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">17:47</span>):  We have seen a great deal of media coverage on the Centrelink debt recovery situation, a number of protests and even a couple of trending hashtags. In emotive situations such as these it is very easy to get caught up, and that is why it is always imperative to examine the facts.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Australia prides itself on having a welfare system—a social safety net—that is the envy of much of the world. It is generous, it is fair and it provides for those who need it. But welfare is not and never has been obligation free. There is a quid pro quo. Those receiving welfare have a moral and societal duty to let Centrelink know about changes in their financial and personal circumstances that might change the amount or the type of welfare that they receive. Welfare recipients have this societal duty to report changes to their personal circumstances to Centrelink because the welfare they receive is the redistribution of taxes. Welfare payments come from the hip pockets of ordinary working Australians. Taxpayers understand this. Indeed, it is an integral part of our society's compact. We help those who cannot help themselves. We provide a hand to those in strife. We look after our vulnerable. And we do so willingly and generously.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">For a number of years now Centrelink has matched its data with that of the tax office to ensure that people are being paid correctly—the right form of welfare and the right amount. This is not new. The only difference now is that the system is automated rather than manual. If a discrepancy between the two sets of data is identified it is the best indicator that the welfare recipient's personal circumstances may have changed. A letter is then sent to the welfare recipient asking them to confirm or update their financial details, and they have 21 days to respond to the request. During this 21 days the welfare recipients payments continue. If the welfare recipient does not respond or if they respond in a manner that indicates changed circumstances, Centrelink will ask for the money to be repaid. Centrelink is not the bad guy. Centrelink, as a custodian of taxpayers' money, is well within its remit to ask for taxpayers' money to be repaid when it has been wrongly received. This is how Australia's welfare system remains fair.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">What concerns me most is the despicable political opportunism of the Labor Party on this matter. Once again the opposition have met our low expectations. Labor's Centrelink scare campaign has been exposed as a fraud. The Leader of the Opposition's rhetoric of 'the summer from hell', of 'hounding ordinary Australians' and of 'cruelty' is mendacious in the extreme. Trading integrity for headlines, the ALP's response has been a seamless continuation of its disgraceful and deceitful Mediscare campaign. Perhaps this behaviour might have been okay in the union movement, from which so many of them have come. Maybe such a demonstrable lack of integrity for the sake of ideological expedience is even admired, but in the corporate sector and the private sector—where I have spent most of my working life—such deceit would be a sackable offence. In the real world good people do not tolerate deceit. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">However, it does not stop there. This time the Labor Party have reached a new low. The ALP have not just exposed themselves; they have unscrupulously used unsuspecting welfare recipients as media patsies to further their political objectives. A thorough review by Centrelink has shown that the majority of people who have been featured in the media alleging mistreatment by Centrelink's compliance system actually do owe money to the Australian taxpayer. According to <span style="font-style:italic;">The Australian</span> newspaper reports of 27 January, one of the young people Labor were parading in front of the media as a victim of the big bad coalition had in fact received $12,000 in youth allowance to which they were not entitled, because they had not declared income from several jobs. Another had been working for a whole year and yet still drew welfare payments, leading to a debt of $4,000. Another woman who claimed to be wrongly pursued by Centrelink had failed to declare $37,500 in income from a small business.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">How dare Senator Brown accuse this government of failing 'their own people'. The ALP exploited these people. You exploited them. You held them up to be poster children and victims in a ruthless, political and ideological pursuit. But you did not do your homework. You were sloppy and you were heartless. You made fools of those people in the public domain. You paraded them in front of the media and you sacrificed their privacy. I would be interested to know if you have apologised to those people for that public humiliation. Have you apologised to them for such public humiliation? Did you do any fact checking at all before you paraded them on talkback radio and before you paraded them in front of the media?</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Did you know that one-third of the cases raised actually had absolutely nothing to do with the online compliance system? Did you also know that many of these debts that the welfare recipients had accrued were accrued during a time of Labor government? The debts accrued under your watch. What were you doing back then? Obviously, not much. Evidently, nothing. They accrued under your watch. You did not pursue these cases on your watch and now you have the audacity to have a go at a government for doing the job that you should have done.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We all know that money to pay welfare does not grow on trees; it comes from taxpayers, from taxpayers' hip pockets, and taxpayers have a right to know that their money is being distributed accurately and to those most vulnerable, to those most in need, to those who cannot look after themselves, not to those who do not meet their societal obligations, not to those who do not recognise that with welfare comes obligations. With welfare there is a quid pro quo. This is what governing responsibly is all about—making sure that taxpayers' rights are as paramount as those of welfare recipients.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The opposition is right in one thing. This deceit, this unscrupulous, opportunistic posturing, and this unprincipled exploitation of ordinary Australians who are unused to media scrutiny is indeed—</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">New South Wales</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">17:57</span>):  I rise as well to debate this MPI on the debt recovery process. I have previously said that this debt recovery system is malicious and bordering on criminal, and I stand by that assessment. The daily disasters that we hear about this process are more than just a series of innocent mistakes. Of course, it is important that our welfare system is carefully administered and guarded to prevent rorting. One Nation has proudly been the strongest voice in terms of cracking down on the exploitation of the system by the lazy, greedy and dishonest. This system does not do that. It is a deliberate shakedown of the most vulnerable by a government that wants to squeeze every bit of blood it can out of people, with little regard to whether those payments are genuinely owed or not.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The people receiving these debt notices know that they are unjust and unfair. The people with the job of administering the system know it is unjust and unfair. The whole community knows this system is unjust and unfair. The government's refusal to back down on this process in the face of the obvious errors and the huge distress they have caused just goes to further prove the ugly indifference to injustice that they showed when they implemented it in the first place. The issue is that it does not matter if you are right. If the government insists you are wrong then you have a massive problem.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">Every government program will have errors of some kind, but in this system the errors are the whole point. It is a system for generating debt claims and then harassing people into paying up, whether those claims are justified or not. In my view, this is deliberate. The reason I say that is that the system has been designed to frustrate attempts to clear up discrepancies. Centrelink staff have been prohibited from leaving file notes on individual cases, so every time a person calls to try to sort out their issue they have to start from square one and do it all over again. Why would this be the case if the goal was to reconcile debts to payments?</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The new system ignores limiting points which were put in place to establish that all debts to payments had been reconciled. Instead, it trawls back through old data and throws up alerts based on issues that have already been dealt with, but these are often so long ago that people no longer have any of the records they need to prove it. Why would this be the case if the goal was to reconcile debts to payments?</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Centrelink staff are required to direct complainants to an online form, despite the fact that these issues can be resolved without the manual help of a Centrelink officer. Why would this be the case if the goal was to reconcile debts to payments?</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The truth of the matter is that the government simply wants more money, and it has set up a system to create false claims through the deliberate disregard of limiting points, and to frustrate attempts to correct those false claims. The goal is not to reconcile debts to payments. The goal is to harass people into paying what they do not owe. This so-called debt recovery process is a disgusting abuse of power, and it is one for which the government must be held to account.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">One Nation will certainly support a Senate inquiry into this issue. If this process is as deliberate as I fear and believe, those responsible will definitely seek to hide their guilt. It is necessary for the sake of good governance and for justice that they are exposed and held to account. Thank you.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Victoria</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">18:02</span>):  Welcome back, colleagues. Great to see you all after a clearly restful break over the summer. I am sad that Senator Dastyari is no longer in the chamber, because I was going to compliment him on his haircut. He is looking very sharp, in contrast to the way he finished the end of last year.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I thank the Greens for raising this important matter in the Senate. They are right that the efficient administration of government programs is a very important issue and they are right that bureaucracies must be as careful as possible to administer their payments in the most sensitive way. But the Turnbull government makes no apologies for ensuring the integrity of our welfare system. It is a $170 billion welfare system which takes up nearly one-third of the budget, and its integrity is of paramount importance. People deserve to be paid exactly what they are eligible for, but they do not deserve to be paid $1 more—</span>

              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Now, the Labor Party—and I hear Senator Polley interjecting—pay lip service to this idea that of course overpayments should be recovered and of course people should only be paid what they are owed, and what they say they care about is an efficient and fair process. Well, we all care about that. There is nothing which distinguishes you from us on that. Centrelink should be recovering these debts in a fair and transparent way. But the truth is that Labor's time in office left a legacy of overpayments that they did not resolve, that they failed to resolve—billions of dollars of overpayments—which this government now, regrettably, has to deal with. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">If we are being completely honest, a significant undercurrent of the Labor Party campaign and the campaign that their allies in the media have been running over the summer, is that it is somehow unfair or unreasonable to recover these funds. The question that they are clearly seeking to leave people with is that, if they were overpaid, somehow that is okay; if they were overpaid, it is not really their fault; if they were overpaid, it should not really be recovered. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">It is a very sad state of affairs when the so-called party of workers reveal themselves to really be the party of welfare. I will not bother addressing my comments to the Greens because they at least have the decency not to claim to be the party of workers. But the Labor Party has claimed and does claim to be the party of workers, and let us remember that what we are talking about here is working-people's money. It is their hard-earned money raised by us in taxes, which is done to provide a necessary safety net for Australians but nothing more than that. If we do not stop the overpayment of welfare, we are in effect taxing people more than we need to, taking more from their family budget than we need to, in order to pay people welfare that they are not entitled to. That is wrong.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The Labor Party have been badly exposed by their own campaign. Many of the cases that they have brought to the media's attention have been ones that appear to constitute fraud, and others that may have been the result of genuine error but are nonetheless still overpayments that must be recovered.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The <span style="font-style:italic;">Australian</span><span style="font-style:italic;"></span>newspaper has published a number of revealing reports on this issue, and I want to quote from one by Joe Kelly, published on 26 January. He says:</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Small">As revealed in <span style="font-style:italic;">The Australian</span>, an assessment of 52 cases of people publicly claiming they were being harassed by Centrelink with automated debt notices found that 18 people had in fact been identified under a manual system established by the former Labor government.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">So we can take those 18 out. He says:</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Small">Of the remaining 34 cases subject to the new system, 60 per cent had been found to have been overpaid for failing to declare other sources of income.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We can take those cases out. He says:</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Small">A further 12 per cent who had been found to owe money had asked for a reassessment while the remaining number of aggrieved welfare recipients had not bothered to contact Centrelink.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">You have to doubt somewhat the sincerity of someone who goes to the media first without even attempting to contact Centrelink to resolve their case. So, even among the tiny number of 52 cases that had been revealed in the media—the supposedly shocking cases which reveal the failure of this process—only 12 per cent of people were who had been found to owe money and had asked for a reassessment. It is their right to ask for a reassessment. They should ask for a reassessment, and it should be carefully and fairly assessed by Centrelink to ensure whether they in fact do owe the money that they had initially been found to owe. But 12 per cent of 52 who had applied for a review and who will not necessarily be found to be in the right in that review is a very small proportion indeed and nothing like what the Labor Party has suggested. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Sadly, there are some good, concrete examples of this in action. These have been de-identified for obvious reasons to protect people's privacy. There was a recipient—who has been identified in the media; a male from Victoria—who had received Newstart for all of the 2013 and 2014 financial years. During that time, they declared that they had received less than $12,000 in employment income. In fact, Australian Taxation Office data showed they had earned more than $16,000 during that time. The customer had accrued a debt of approximately $3,000 in those financial years. It is good that this new system has identified this debt to the Commonwealth—it has identified this instance where someone has been paid welfare to which they were not entitled—and the system is now seeking to recover that debt. A second customer, also a male and also from Victoria, had received Austudy for all of the 2014-15 financial year. During that time, they declared less than $15,000 in employment income. However, ATO data showed that they had earned more than $25,000 during that time. As a result, they owed a debt of approximately $3½ thousand to the Commonwealth for those financial years. Again, I am pleased, personally, that that has been identified by the new system. I am glad that it has been identified. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Alan Tudge, the responsible minister, was addressing this issue in the House today. He talked about two further extraordinary examples of even greater sums. A Queensland male had been receiving Newstart for all of the financial years 2011-12 and 2012-13. During that time, they declared less than $5,000 of employment income to Centrelink. In fact, ATO data showed they had received more than $100,000 during that time. So, if someone has received $100,000 in two financial years and declared that they had only received $5,000, it is likely that every single dollar of Newstart that they received was received under false pretences and should be repaid. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Alan Tudge talked about another example, again another Victorian male and again a recipient of the Newstart allowance. Over three financial years, they declared less than $11,000 in income. Again, the ATO data showed they had earned more than $65,000 during that time. This is something that the new system identified and picked up. I think that is actually a very welcome thing. If it were not for these new processes, if it were not for the reforms brought in by this government and recovery sought for this money, then these may have never been uncovered. These people who had received welfare which they were not entitled to receive may never have been identified. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Labor is asking the government to scrap this successful process, which is successfully identifying cases of overpayment. In effect, what Labor is trying to protect is people who have defrauded either deliberately or inadvertently through error the welfare system and received money that they are not entitled to receive. They have asked us to stop a system which is recovering taxpayers' money—money that should never have been paid, but nonetheless has been paid. The coalition government will continue with this process because it is successfully identifying cases of overpayment and identifying cases of fraud, and it is acting appropriately to address it. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The government is recovering those funds because, at the end of the day, the Australian people do not go to work, working long hours to support their family and pay a reasonable share of that income to the federal government in taxes to support the services that we all enjoy, unless they know that those dollars are going to be used wisely and fairly. They do not go to work with the expectation that we are going take more money than we need to from them in order to give it to someone who is not entitled to it. These are working people whose family budget depends in part on how much money the government takes from them each year. If we take less of it, there will be much less strain on their family budget. If we take more of it, there will be more strain on their family budget—and it is morally wrong to take more than we need to to pay someone who is not entitled to it. That is what this system addresses. That is what this system has identified. There are potentially billions of dollars of funds involved in this, and it is entirely appropriate that the government is using the latest technology and data matching to achieve this end. </span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">New South Wales</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">18:11</span>):  The performance of the coalition on this issue today, both in question time and in this MPI, has been nothing short of pathetic. It shows why they are so incompetent. It certainly demonstrates how uncaring they are, and it shows what a cruel government they are. They really are pathetic. No-one in this Senate, no-one in the parliament, wants anyone to receive one cent that they are not entitled to, but you do not deal with that by incompetent management of the Centrelink system and by hounding innocent members of the public and making claims on them. If a private company had done this, that private company would be the ones engaged in fraud. It is Centrelink that is carrying out the fraudulent exercise here on behalf of an incompetent, uncaring and cruel government. That is the bottom line here. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">This is about revenue raising at the expense of innocent Australians. Some of them do not owe the government one cent. For Senator Hume and Senator Paterson to stand up here and give us a couple of examples of where there has been fraudulent activity in the Centrelink system, in the welfare system, shows nothing. Fraud has been taking place for many years, and there have been strong checks and balances in place through any number of governments over a period of time to deal with this issue. But this is not about Minister Tudge coming in and saying, 'Here's a couple of examples of fraud,' and then trying to tar everyone else with that brush, but that is what Senator Paterson has done here this afternoon. He has been trying to tar everyone who has been wrongly accused of defrauding the system with the same brush as someone who has defrauded the Commonwealth. That is not acceptable and it shows why this government is so far out of touch.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">You only have to look at what has happened to the government today to see how out of touch it is. It is in absolute crisis in the Senate, with a member of the Liberal Party, Senator Bernardi—who, I think, has been your national vice-president and state president of the party—resigning from the party because he does not want to be part of an incompetent government. He does not want to be part of a government that does not care about the real issues in this country.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">You are so out of touch with Australians who are battling to maintain their living standards. You are so out of touch with the realities of Australians who fall on tough times and need the support from government in their time of need. To simply send out 20,000 letters a week—the government accepts that 20 per cent of them are not accurate. That is, it is sending out 4,000 letters a week that are not accurate. Is there any wonder that the polls are telling you that the Australian public have had a gutful of this incompetent government? This government will not have a royal commission into the fraudulent behaviour of the banks but want to crucify ordinary Australians when they are simply falling on hard times and are seeking the support from government when they need it.</span>

If a private company did that it would be seen as a fraudulent letter trying to extort money from an individual under false pretences. Yet all these great libertarians on the coalition side are arguing that is okay. It is not okay. These citizens are innocent. These citizens do not have a problem. The only problem they have is when they get letters threatening them with recovery for a debt that they do not owe.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">The other situation was that you had a minister, Minister Tudge, who went to the media—talking about the media—on 5 December and said, 'We will find you. We will track you down. You will have to repay those debts and you may end up in prison.' He was talking to something like 4,000 Australians a week, who were getting letters saying they had a debt but who had no debt, and threatening to put them in prison. What an incompetent minister this guy is. It is no wonder he disappeared off the scene soon after that. We then had Minister Porter come in on 3 January when this all blew up. He said he did not even know that there was a 10 per cent recovery fee. So we had one minister threatening with prison ordinary Australians who have done nothing wrong and another minister who did not even know that the government had set up a recovery fee. What an incompetent mob you really are.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">I was on call during the early period when this blew up, and my office started getting phone calls from ordinary Australian citizens, who had done nothing wrong, saying, 'I've got this bill for a debt that I don't owe. What can I do?' I had people coming into my office in tears saying that they were being told they had a debt. They had no money to pay the debt. They did not think they had a debt but they could not get their local Centrelink office to answer the questions. They could not get their local Centrelink office to help them, because this dirty rotten government had told the Centrelink officers that you are not allowed to help these citizens who were under threat by your government. That is what you were doing. It is absolutely outrageous.</span>

Is it any wonder you get chaos within the Liberal Party? Is it any wonder members of your party are leaving? You are so incompetent. You are so cruel.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">You will not take on the banks. You will not take on the big end of town. But what you will do is attack the poor and defenceless in this country. You will attack them. You will come after them. You will threaten them with jail. But you will not go near the people who put the money in your pockets for your election campaigns. You will not go near them. What a hypocritical mob you are. It is absolutely outrageous behaviour—behaviour that the public know is unacceptable. That is why you are in the position you are in: with a Prime Minister with no credibility, a party with no credibility and a party with members deserting the sinking ship. That is where you are at the moment. It is absolutely outrageous. Your conduct is absolutely unacceptable.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">I can go through example after example. A solicitor with the office of the Director of Public Prosecutions contacted my office. He was previously a prosecutor and legal advisor with the New South Wales Police Force. He had a $3,400 debt reduced to zero, but he got a bill for $3,400. Ian, a disability worker, had an $8,000 debt reduced to $1,300 but he is still challenging the amount. Annabelle, a retired academic currently receiving treatment for cancer, had a debt of over $14,000 when she was doing casual university lecturing. It was being reviewed, and on and on we go.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">
                  <a href="e5x" type="MemberSpeech">
                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Senator POLLEY</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Tasmania</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">18:22</span>):  I rise to make a contribution in relation to this disastrous, inaccurate automated debt recovery process and this government's refusal to abandon the system. Today would have been a good opportunity for the Turnbull government to act on the Centrelink robo-debt debacle that has been devastating thousands of Australians over the summer. The government has issued more than 170,000 debt notices as part of the robo-debt system, and we know that there is at least a 40 per cent inaccuracy rate when these debt notices have been sent out to people. Many of these people received the notices prior to Christmas. If you have a debt being allocated to your name—whether it is tens of thousands of dollars, $10,000, $2,000 or $1,000—what this government has failed to acknowledge is that these people who have been receiving these notices take those letter very seriously.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We know, because we deal with these sorts of issues every day, how difficult it will be for those people and how long it will take for those people who have received a letter and thought 'Heavens, this is something that I'm going to have to repay,' because they did not know how to go about appealing it. Because there is so little support within the legal centres around this country because of the cuts that have been made to them, they have struggled to get advice. We know on this side of the chamber—and others from the crossbenches have made a contribution—that people have been ringing our electorate offices in tears. They are utterly devastated to think that they would owe this money, and at least 40 per cent have had a debt put against their names without any foundation.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">What we have seen in Minister Tudge is an incompetent minister who failed to recognise that the government have botched this up, just as they have done on so many occasions. It does not seem to matter what the government touch: they stuff it up. That is the purest and simplest way to describe the shambolic, dysfunctional government, who cannot even admit when they have got something so basically wrong. It is time that Mr Turnbull and his government accepted the responsibility for this scandal, rather than trying to blame everyone else. This is their mess. This is Minister Tudge's mess, this is Malcolm Turnbull's mess and they have to take responsibility for that—no-one else.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I want to turn to the effect that this shambolic government has had on my fellow Tasmanians. Thousands and thousands of letters that have been sent out have been blatantly incorrect. They have been sent to some of the most vulnerable people in our communities, and this government needs to take responsibility for this debacle.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">It is not just us on this side. It is not just the Labor Senate team and our House of Representatives colleagues from Bass, Braddon, Franklin and Lyons. We have all experienced the devastation of these people making contact with our offices, but even the Liberal Senate team have said that they have concerns. But they are not prepared—as Malcolm Turnbull was to buy his own election—to put their money where their mouths are. The Liberal Senate team have paid lip service to that, but where is Senator Duniam? Why isn't he in this chamber supporting us? He has had representations to his office. We have even had Senator Abetz make comments to the media about the debacle that this government has undertaken with this policy, but what they say in their electorate and what they do when they come into this chamber are two different things. That is what it is: 'I will pay lip service to the local media, but when I come to Canberra I'm standing firm with Malcolm Turnbull and the debacle that this policy has created out in the community.'</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I would like to talk about just one case that has come across my desk—and I have spoken to the individual. A woman received a notice that she owed the department a couple of thousand dollars—$3,000, I think it was. But when she spoke to the Centrelink staff she challenged them, and what they said to her was, 'Oh, we've made a mistake: we've double-counted what you have advised us.' So she had quite clearly done nothing wrong, and she said, 'Well, then, withdraw your letter,' and what was she advised to do? 'You have to go through the process. You have to go through the appeal.' I was speaking to her again at the weekend, and she said to me—she was very proud of it, and so she should be—that she is not going to be bullied by this government. She is not going to be bullied by the debt collector's letter when they come knocking on her door, because she has always done the right thing. She is honest as the day is long. What an insult and affront to a woman who, as a single mother, has made something of herself, gone back to work and advised the department, as she should. She has to go through this debacle because of this incompetent, dysfunctional, shambolic government.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Those opposite come in here, say, 'Oops!' and talk about two cases where two people have done the wrong thing. There is not a person in this chamber that does not agree that, if you have been overpaid, of course the taxpayer would expect that that money be repaid. But, when you have at least a 40 per cent rate of inaccuracies and you have basically got it all wrong, that is not good enough.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">That is why the government are in so much turmoil, because they are not listening to the community. They are so arrogant and out of touch. That is the only way you can look at it. We have seen a demonstration of it here in this chamber today, and not just from us. We tell the government every time we are in this chamber, and we try to tell them through the media every day when we are back in our electorates, that they are so far out of touch. Senator Cory Bernardi has done what very few people will do, and that is to walk away from his own political party that put him in this chamber. He is the one who has put it on the public record today that this government is out of touch and arrogant. They cannot listen to the opposition, they are not prepared to listen to the crossbenches and they are not prepared to listen to the community. Obviously the senators on that side of the chamber do not go out into the real world and talk to people in the suburbs and the communities. If they do then obviously they are not listening, because this is the hottest issue around the summer barbecue, and it does not matter where you go.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We are talking about real people here. We are talking about people who have enormous challenges. They need a helping hand up. If you have never walked in the shoes of somebody like that then you have no understanding. Some of us have actually done that, and this is such a huge insult to those people. You should all hang your heads in shame—you really should. We know that the next cohort of people will be the aged pensioners and those people living on disability payments. All I can say is: you better get it right before those letters go out, otherwise you may very well end up with blood on your hands. This is so serious that people are stressed to the limit—and that is without going to those people who do not necessarily have the skills to be able to go through and challenge this government.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">As you all know in this chamber, if you have a bad debt name, it is very hard to clear your debt. It is extremely hard to clear your debt, and the last people that you would expect to put that burden on any Australian would be the federal government. It is an absolute disgrace. I am ashamed to sit in the chamber with people who would do this to their fellow Australians. Of course we want that money paid back if it has been overpaid—of course we do. No-one is denying that some people do rort the system, but the overwhelming majority of people who are taking benefits from Centrelink are doing so because they have little other choice. I am ashamed to be a senator in the federal parliament where I sit opposite a government that is so arrogant, so heartless and so out of touch.</span>

This is one of the most fundamental funding processes to address Aboriginal disadvantage. The government got it so wrong. This is why Aboriginal organisations were saying at the time, 'This is a flawed process.' Aboriginal leaders were talking about it. Community organisations were talking about it. This is a damning report. The government needs a total rethink about the strategy from the start. The government have said of the recommendations, like they always do, that they agree with them. But I am not at all confident that they are going to sufficiently reform this process to give any confidence that the IAS is going to deliver. One of the things this report says is that with the process as set up there is no sense that the objectives are being met. I for one am not confident that they will be.

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This document is the regional forest agreement between the Commonwealth of Australia and the state of Victoria. I will only take up a short amount of the Senate's time, knowing how precious it is at the moment. But I have to note this very important re-signing of the regional forest agreement that took place. The 20-year regional forest agreement between the Commonwealth and the state of Victoria for the East Gippsland forest area was the first of the 20-year regional forest agreements to be signed. It expired last Friday. This agreement has now been extended for 13 months. This extension was done extremely quietly. It was a bit like a wink and a nod in a dark car park the night before. It was only announced the night before the agreement was due to expire last Friday. Clearly it was not something that either the state of the Commonwealth were shouting from the rooftops about because I cannot see how they could be proud of it.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The regional forest agreements have failed. One has been in place for 20 years in East Gippsland, and the remaining regional forest agreements are going to expire over the next couple of years. They have failed to protect jobs and they have failed to protect the environment. We have a situation now in East Gippsland where we have species that live in these forests that were threatened 20 years ago and are now critically endangered. So they are now hurtling towards extinction. The logging that is taking place under this regional forest agreement is the threatening process that is leading these animals closer and closer towards the edge.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We have forests that are some of the most carbon dense in the world. They have 200 times the carbon stored in them as the average forest globally. Yet the importance of these forests for soaking up carbon and playing a role in tackling global warming is not even recognised in these regional forest agreements.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The other thing that is very clear after 20 years of these forest agreements failing to protect our forest environments is the insanity of the fact that by having these agreements in place it means that our national environmental laws do not apply to forests that are covered by these agreements. In the mining industry you have to assess a mine and how it is going to impact on threatened species. But because it is declared that forestry that occurs under an area that is covered by a regional forest agreement by definition is ecologically sustainable forestry we do not need to go through that process. That is why you can have critically endangered species and logging that is still continuing to destroy their homes. That is why when a clear-fell operation occurs you can have greater gliders thrown out of their nests. That is why you can have the habitat of the long-footed potoroos totally destroyed.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Clearly this is not the way for the future. We know that Australians love their forests. They want to see their forests protected. We also know that a sustainable wood product industry is important to Australia and is possible. The majority of the wood products industry in Australia now has already transitioned into plantations. The native forest logging industry is the rump of wood production in Australia, and it is time that rump was quietly transitioned out so we can protect our forests.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Extending these agreements in such a wink-and-a-nod way before last Friday means that we are not taking these opportunities. The opportunity was there to restore the balance and to acknowledge that this is not the way to be managing our forests into the future, that we need to be managing our forests by transitioning out of native forests and into plantations. That is the direction the Australian community wants to see for forest management.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">My real concern is that we have had the East Gippsland forest agreement just rolled over and the government have told us that this is what they intend to do for every other forest agreement across the country. The Australian public will not put up with this. We have had forest wars continuing the decades. We had the opportunity to move on from those—to be protecting forests and to be protecting jobs and to truly have resource security in a plantation based industry but that opportunity has been lost.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Forest campaigning is not going to go away. People who are concerned about our forests and who want them protected for tourism, water and animals are not going to go away. We are going to keep on campaigning until we protect those forests for their beautiful values. I seek leave to continue my remarks later </span>

                  <span class="HPS-Small">On 24 June 2015, the Community Affairs References Committee released a report outlining the findings from the Senate Inquiry into the Adequacy of existing residential care arrangements available for young people with severe physical, mental or intellectual disabilities in Australia. The report makes twelve recommendations for consideration by the Australian Government (one to six), the Joint Standing Committee on the National Disability Insurance Scheme (seven), and the Council of Australian Governments (COAG) (eight to twelve).</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">The Department of Social Services (DSS), the Department of Health, the Australian Institute of Health and Welfare, the National Disability Insurance Agency (NDIA), and the Australian Bureau of Statistics (ABS) appeared at the Inquiry's hearing in Canberra and outlined Australian Government support available for young people in, or at risk of entering, residential aged care.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">According to the Report on Government Services 2016, in June 2015, there were 6,252 young people in nursing homes around Australia. This comprises 555 young people aged 0-49 years and 5,697 aged 50-64 years.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">The issues faced by young people with severe disability span the responsibilities of a range of Commonwealth agencies and different levels of government, and involve both specialist and mainstream services. The National Disability Strategy 2010-2020 (the strategy) provides an overarching policy framework for all levels of government to improve the lives of people with disability. Action taken under the strategy to improve the accessibility of mainstream services for people with disability complements specialist disability services and programs currently provided by Commonwealth, state and territory governments, including those provided through the National Disability Insurance Scheme (NDIS). The strategy seeks to ensure that both disability-specific and mainstream support services are available to all Australians with disability. The Australian Government is committed to examining how it can work more collaboratively across sectors to improve service co-ordination and outcomes for young people in, or at risk of entering, residential aged care.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">The Australian Government agrees with the need to prevent new admissions by encouraging collaboration between state and territory disability services, the NDIA and the health system to better meet the needs of young people in, or at risk of moving into, nursing homes. As the Committee noted in its reports, we are currently in a time of transition, changing the way that disability services are administered and delivered by the states, territories and the Commonwealth. The Australian Government recognises the importance of supporting participants as the NDIS transitions to a national scheme.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">The Australian Government believes that the provision of co-ordinated and integrated services that take into account an individual's needs at different stages of recovery or disability are necessary to assist young people with high care needs. Under the National Disability Agreement (NDA), state and territory governments have all undertaken to deliver on-the-ground services that help younger people with disability in, or at risk of entering, residential aged care.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">The NDA is an high-level agreement between the Commonwealth, states and territories. It is the framework for the provision of government support for people with disability, and explicitly confirms jurisdictional responsibilities in relation to the provision of disability services. Prior to the full nationwide rollout of the NDIS, state and territory governments remain responsible for all non-trial site disability services in their respective jurisdictions, including supported accommodation.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">From 2006 to 2011, the Commonwealth provided an additional $122 million to the states as part of the Younger People in Residential Aged Care Initiative (YPIRAC). The aim of the initiative was to reduce the number of younger people with disabilities living in nursing homes and over five years an estimated 1,432 people were assisted. Since 2011, the Commonwealth has provided funding to the states and territories to support younger people with disability in, or at risk of entering, residential aged care as part of the Specific Purpose Payment (SPP) for Disability Services related to the NDA. The Australian Government will work with the states and territories to examine how the needs of young people in, or at risk of entering, nursing homes are being addressed in the lead up to full roll out of the NDIS.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">Following NDIS roll out, Australians with significant and permanent disabilities will have improved opportunities to determine what is in their own best interests. They will have increased choice and control over the planning and delivery of their supports, including the ability to take reasonable risks and to select supports that best meet their individual needs and preferences.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">When the NDIS commences in their area, young people in nursing homes and their families are able to apply for specialist disability accommodation supports, which will enable them to move to accommodation more appropriate for their needs. Through the NDIS, young people and their families can apply for supports to help them to live independently in the community, including personal and domestic care, home modifications and supports to enable them to access and maintain accommodation. The NDIS will also help people to access other service systems and co-ordinate their supports across systems. The NDIS is currently supporting young people in nursing homes living within areas of NDIS operation. The NDIA is funding the Summer Foundation to work with young people in nursing homes to engage with the NDIS. For those people who have undergone planning, there are a range of capacity building supports and support co-ordination included in plans.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">The Australian Government is committed to ensuring people with disability have access to a range of supports that will allow them, their families and carers to participate as valued members of their communities. The Australian Government currently supports younger people in, or at risk of entering, residential aged care through Disability Support and Carer Payments; support for carers; younger onset dementia key worker program; and Commonwealth funding for jurisdictions following the Younger People in Residential Age Care (YPIRAC) initiative.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Small">The Aged Care Assessment Program holds assessment and approval related data. As part of their assessment, Aged Care Assessment Teams (ACATs) gather relevant information on a person's medical diagnoses and other background information to support the decision for eligibility for care types under the Aged Care Act.

As such, it is unlikely that any data system could accurately capture this information. However, should a young person in residential care be eligible for the NDIS, this would be considered as part of the NDIS assessment process. Under the NDIS Specialist Disability Accommodation Pricing and Payments Framework, young people living in residential aged care facilities will be a priority group for access to specialist disability accommodation supports.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Small">The Australian Government supports in principle the committee's recommendation to conduct a Longitudinal Survey of Disability, Ageing and Carers (SDAC). This recommendation highlights the importance and value of the ongoing ABS Survey of Disability, Ageing and Carers (SDAC) data in informing policy responses and service planning for those with disability and/or those living in aged care facilities.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Small">In recent times, there has been a growing demand for longitudinal data to allow populations of interest to be tracked—their transitions, pathways and outcomes. Conducting a longitudinal survey has the potential to measure the influence of changes in Government policy, as well as assess the benefits and outcomes of services and programs (for example early intervention programs) on individual population groups, such as young people with severe disabilities. However, the continuation of funding for the SDAC collection remains the priority for the Australian Government before considering funding for any additional surveys.</span>

In recognition of the importance of this collection in underpinning policy development, planning, reporting and service delivery, the Commonwealth and state and territory Governments have committed to providing additional funding to support an increase in the collection's frequency between 2010 and 2020 (from a six-yearly survey to a triennial survey), as well as an increase in the collection's sample size.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Small">States and territories have established collaborative, localised protocols between their relevant disability services and ACATs. These protocols are consistent with the National Guiding Principles for the Referral and Assessment of Younger People with Disability between state and territory disability services and Aged Care Assessment Teams. The principles were developed between the Commonwealth and state and territory governments for the referral of younger people with disability for assessment and co-ordination of their specialist disability accommodation and support services. It is the responsibility of the relevant state or territory disability services agency to initially assess younger people with disability and ensure they are referred to the most appropriate care service available. All options for specialist disability accommodation and support services should be fully explored and utilised before an ACAT accepts a referral for assessment and approval.</span>

The Specialist Disability Accommodation Decision Paper on Pricing and Payments (the Decision Paper), released on 1 June 2016, outlines the benchmark prices which are paid to providers of specialist disability accommodation that NDIS participants choose to live in. These benchmark prices are formulated based on the policy agreed by the Disability Reform Council of Commonwealth and State and Territory Ministers (DRC) in November 2015 through the Specialist Disability Accommodation Pricing and Payments Framework. The benchmark prices reflect the additional costs incurred in providing specialist disability accommodation and are intended to contribute to the lifecycle costs of the land and the dwelling.

                  <span class="HPS-Small">Additionally, the Specialist Disability Accommodation Initiative (SDAI) was established to help address immediate community need for specialist disability housing in areas outside NDIS trial sites by providing 'top up' funding to increase the availability of accommodation for people with a disability and identify project initiatives with self-sustaining specialist disability housing models which could be scaled up in the future. Funding of up to $10 million will be offered through grants of up to $1 million to organisations for projects which meet these needs and which have a particular focus on those housed in inappropriate accommodation settings and those with ageing carers who are in need of a long-term, sustainable arrangement. The Department of Social Services concluded a grant round in February 2016. Twelve organisations presented successful applications to deliver specialist disability accommodation and the Department has entered into negotiations with these organisations.</span>

However, most NDIS participants will have their housing needs addressed through mainstream arrangements, with the NDIS assisting participants to navigate mainstream housing systems where reasonable and necessary. For example an NDIS participant may receive assistance with navigating rental markets, tenancy obligations and short-term transitional accommodation. The NDIS may also ensure the home a participant chooses meets their needs by providing home modifications, assistive products for household tasks, food preparation, linen services, cleaning, and house and yard maintenance.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Small">In a health context, rehabilitation is commonly understood to refer to treatment designed to facilitate the process of an individual's recovery of function following a disabling injury, illness, or disease. This treatment, which typically involves specialised health professionals including doctors, nurses and allied health professionals (such as physiotherapists, speech therapists, occupational therapists) is provided within a planned, supervised and progressive program aimed at enabling an individual to achieve their optimal degree of physical and psychological capability. Rehabilitation's emphasis on therapeutic restoration distinguishes it from maintenance therapy which focuses on maintaining an individual's existing level of functioning.</span>

Such planning takes into account not only the current and projected health status of the resident population, but also the existing range of services available across the public, not for profit and private health sectors. Drawing on expert clinical advice and evidence of best practice generated by national and international clinical research, Local Hospital Networks then identify any gaps in service delivery and opportunities for service improvement, and use this information to inform their priority setting and resourcing decisions.</span>

Young people living in residential care are eligible to access free, independent and individualised advocacy services through two Australian Government programs: the National Aged Care Advocacy Program; and the National Disability Advocacy Program (NDAP). A young person may choose to access either program depending on what their need is for advocacy support. Both advocacy programs can provide support and information to the young person and their families about care options available to them and can advocate on their behalf in raising issues about the care they are receiving. It is important to note that access to advocacy services is voluntary, and the independence of advocacy programs is a key feature.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Small">The NDIA has recognised the need to identify and address issues related to Foetal Alcohol Spectrum Disorder (FASD). Early in 2015, the NDIA funded a project to specifically inform the NDIA on FASD. The project has assisted the NDIA to develop a best practice evidence base that is supporting decision-making within the requirements of legislation governing the NDIA. The project report also supports parent/carer access to relevant information to improve decision making in the selection of appropriate services for children with FASD and the project itself has brought together experts who have now formed the Australian FASD Clinical Network. The new Australian FASD Clinical Network aims to enhance national communication between those involved in assisting those with FASD and further develop the research and evidence associated with diagnosis and interventions.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">A group of leading researchers from the Telethon Kids Institute led this work, and draw on the expertise of a broad Expert Reference Panel which included key representatives of practitioners and people with disability, families and carers, including Indigenous Australians and those from rural and remote settings.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">The project included a comprehensive literature review and series of consultations, and the final report for the project was reviewed and refined in cooperation with the Expert Reference Panel. The report findings have been utilised by the NDIA in the preparation of its revised Early Childhood Early Intervention (ECEI) Approach. The report thus informs planning and implementation of appropriate supports for people with FASD. In particular, the inclusion of information on domains of functional impairment across the life course, and current best practice guidance on interventions will continue to assist providers and the NDIA to prepare plans and supports (including their outcomes measurement) for each individual participant.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">In line with the legislation and insurance nature of the NDIS, early intervention is considered an important factor which applies to consideration of life course intervention for people with FASD. The NDIS ECEI approach will provide support to children with disability or developmental delay and their families through organisations and services in their local community.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">Organisations with ECEI expertise will support children and families in their initial engagement with the NDIS, identify the appropriate level of early intervention required by the child and their family. The service will also be able to assist children to be supported in a broad range of settings such as preschool, playgroups and other early childhood services.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">This approach will lead to greater inclusion for children with developmental delay and disability in preschools and other mainstreams settings, allowing them to be children first through increased opportunities for positive social relationships.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">This approach is currently being trialled in the Nepean Blue Mountains and will commence in the Queensland Early Transition site in Townsville and Charters Towers and will be adopted in South Australia</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">The NDIA continues to work with rural and remote communities to develop appropriate workforce development. This will ensure community responses to functional impairment related to FASD are individualised and available when needed. Community and individual support will also be developed as part of the ILC framework. NDIS plans already include provision of early intervention services including and as well as allied health services such as speech pathology, physiotherapy and occupational therapy.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">The NDIA is in communication with the Department of Health, which is funding work related to diagnostic tools for FASD. The NDIA FASD Research Project was conducted within this context and has been tailored to be appropriate to current and emerging developments. Australian work on a diagnostic tool will inform future consideration of assessment to support eligibility determination for the NDIS around FASD and guidance as part of the recommend individualised planning and intervention. Direct involvement in diagnosis of conditions is not within the role of the NDIA.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">While the NDIA is not the appropriate funder of diagnostic work, liaison with the Department of Health and researchers carrying out diagnostic work will continue. The link between diagnosis, identification of functional impairments and funding of appropriate supports, including early intervention will require understanding and communication between the relevant groups involved, including participants, families and carers. No clear data is yet available to indicate numbers of NDIS participants with FASD. Many participants will be identified under other diagnoses. When an agreed Australian diagnostic tool is developed, further work will be undertaken by the NDIA to identify FASD as part of NDIS data. This will be ongoing work as planning for full Scheme rollout continues.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Small">The ASIC and MSIC schemes are an important part of securing the aviation, maritime and offshore oil and gas sectors. ASICs and MSICs are nationally consistent identification cards that show the holder has met the minimum security requirements to remain unmonitored within an aviation or maritime security zone. All individuals who require an ASIC or MSIC must have a valid background check.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Small">The purpose of the background check is primarily to establish whether an applicant may pose a threat to aviation and maritime security. The background check does not currently consider whether they pose a criminal risk.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Small">A number of inquiries and reports have identified vulnerabilities in the ASIC and MSIC schemes. These have focused on the limited purpose of the schemes, in particular their inability to address serious criminality at airports and ports. Notably, the 2011 Parliamentary Joint Committee on Law Enforcement (PJCLE), <span style="font-style:italic;">Inquiry into the adequacy of aviation and maritime security measures to combat serious and organised crime</span>, highlighted that because the ASIC and MSIC schemes were never originally designed to harden the transport environment against serious and organised crime, organised crime groups have exploited gaps, weaknesses and inconsistencies in the application of the regimes.</span>

                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">That the Senate take note of the document.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">As most would know, I have chaired the committee in one shape, way or form for the last nine or 10 years, but I was on the committee inquiry into this legislation. This is an absolutely disastrous piece of legislation. The opposition has put in a dissenting report; the Greens have put in a dissenting report. I notice that the committee, of which I am a member, without the support of the Labor senators, has endorsed the report and the recommendations and the government has picked it up.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">What we have here, Madam Deputy President, is an absolute attack on Australian shipping jobs. There is no argument that the shipping industry is trying everything that it can to be competitive around the world, but we are fooling ourselves if we think that we can drop ourselves to the lowest common denominator and compete with foreign seafarers on flags-of-convenience vessels. What we have here is the federal government's attack on our industry. We are an island and, make no mistake, shipping is absolutely our main thrust of moving freight on and off this great country, this island, to all parts of the world and in between and coming back.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We do not have the ability to train captains and masters in three- or four-day session in TAFE. These jobs, these skills, these professions are grown over years and years of seafaring expertise from our sailors and seafarers. Unfortunately, I cannot for the life of me believe that the Australian government goes to an election and all the government can talk about is 'jobs and growth, jobs and growth'. The sad part about this—and every Australian needs to understand this—is: if you are an Australian seafarer plying your trade between Australian ports, the 'jobs and growth' is fine so long as it is not Australians doing it. I am not making this up. This is a pure attack on Australian seafarers. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I have heard all the bulldust and all the arguments of why we cannot have Australian seafarers, but there comes a time when we have to draw the line and we have to say to someone at the top end of town, 'You may want to deliver more for your shareholders'—I understand how it all works—but when we talk about the environmental consequences that can come. We have seen collisions on the Great Barrier Reef, oil spills and ships falling apart. They are not Australian-crewed vessels that do this.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We also have to sit through—I will tell you what—the beefed up stuff on 'Don't be alarmed but be alert' and all this sort of stuff. You want to talk about security; we all want to talk about national security; we want to protect our borders and we want to know who is coming into this country. We can't guarantee that if we are doing away with Australian seafarers and we are letting flag-of-convenience vessels ply their trade in and out of our ports, carting our freight on previously Australian-flagged vessels with Australian crew. What the hell is this nation coming to?</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I am going to look across the chamber to the little corner over there of One Nation and others—you cannot just keep your head down. One Nation senators have to understand that you are very good at stirring up the possum about protectionism and nationalism—Senator Xenophon and the NXT Senators as well—but if you do not stand up and you do not support Labor's position on this terrible bill, I will call you out because you will be selling out Australian seafaring jobs.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">You can challenge me in every corner of this building because I have done the inquiry. We have heard from numerous people and from the Australian shipping industry as well, who have come to tell us how bad this could be. We had figures put to us. We asked the MUA. You can challenge it. You can go and ask the owners of the ships: how many Australian jobs could we lose? They have told us uncategorically 1,200 Australian jobs will go if this terrible legislation gets up. I am glad Senator Xenophon is walking in because Senator Xenophon has been a very strong, solid supporter, and I would hope and pray that nothing has changed his position on Australian seafaring jobs. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">My colleague the good Senator Gallacher from South Australia wishes to make a contribution, and I do not want to thwart his contribution on another bill. I seek leave to continue my remarks later and I will have another crack again on Thursday. I am not going to give up. I have been going on about this for about the last two years and, unfortunately, there does not seem to be any support from the other side. They are glad to see jobs and growth as long as they are not Australian jobs.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The Trans-Pacific Partnership is a broad-ranging regional trade deal between the governments of Australia, Brunei, Dar es Salaam, Canada, Chile, Japan, Malaysia, Mexico, New Zealand, Peru, Singapore, the United States and Vietnam. The committee's inquiry found that the TPP would have included significant trade and investment outcomes which would potentially have assisted Australian injury industry, business and consumers. However, a number of very troubling aspects were raised by the submitters including: the lack of independent economic modelling which indicated Australia would actually benefit from the agreement; the high risks associated with the investor-state dispute settlement provisions, which would allow foreign corporations to sue the Australian government in some circumstances; provisions undermining labour market testing requirements in Australia; again, the lack of enforceable commitments to labour and environmental standards; further, ambiguity regarding data protection for biologic medical products; and provisions which would lock in Australia's intellectual property regime.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">A significant level of community concern regarding the TPP was apparent during the committee's inquiry. Thousands of emails were received from individuals urging that the TPP be rejected. In particular, people emphasised their concerns regarding the potential of that ISDS provisions contained in the TPP to undermine the Australian government's capacity to act in the national interest.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">However, the committee's inquiry has been taken over overtaken by events. In January, President Trump signed an executive order withdrawing the United States from the TPP. Due to the structure of entry into force provisions in the TPP, it is now unlikely the agreement will enter into force in its current form. So due to these circumstances, the committee has made the decision not to hold public hearings and to complete the inquiry on the papers. A revived trade deal may be arranged by the remaining participating countries in the future and, should this occur, a new inquiry will be required.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Recently the Australian government has indicated that it may still attempt to ratify the TPP through introducing implementing legislation into the parliament. However, the trade minister has also stated he is liaising with his counterparts to lock in benefits from the TPP without the United States if need be. If the Australian government is actively seeking alternative trade arrangements with the remaining countries who participated in the TPP, it is not clear to the committee why ratification should be a legislative priority. Achieving access to the substantial markets of the United States was a key objective and justification for the TPP agreement. A new regional trade agreement would contain significantly different arrangements and commitments. So, accordingly, the committee has recommended the Australian government should defer undertaking binding treaty action until the future of the TPP is clarified through further negotiation with Australia's major trading partners.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">A significant aspect of the TPP consideration by the Australian parliament was two recommendations for reform to the treaty-making process made by the Joint Standing Committee on Treaties and these were that the Australian government should consider: firstly, changing its approach to free trade agreement negotiations to permit security cleared representatives from business and civil society to see the Australian government's positions being put as part of the negotiations; and secondly, implementing a process through which independent modelling and analysis of proposed trade agreement is undertaken by the Productivity Commission or equivalent organisation and provided to the joint committee alongside the national interest assessment to improve the assessment of agreements. They are two very succinct, comprehensive, common-sense objectives: do not have a secret deal—open it up to civil society and business; and cost the benefits of the trade deal independently—assess it.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The committee supports these recommendations. They reflect the growing consensus regarding the need for reform of the treaty-making process, which was also evident in submissions received by the committee's inquiry. The TPP was perceived by many to be emblematic of the problems in this area. A broad range of submitters highlighted issues with the transparency of treaty negotiations, the one-sided nature of consultations with stakeholders, the lack of adequate and independent assessment of trade agreements, and the challenges the current treaty-making process presents to Australia's democratic values. The joint committee's recommendations also align with the committee's recommendations for reform made in 2015 in <span style="font-style:italic;">Blind agreement: reforming Australia's treaty-making process</span>. At that time the committee's recommendations were not accepted by the Australian government. The committee considers these proposals for reform should be reassessed.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The joint committee's report into the TPP outlined a concern that Australia's long-term commitment to free trade, from which Australia benefits immensely, is currently at risk from a resurgence of nationalism and isolationism internationally. However, this is not evident in the submissions to the committee's inquiry into the TPP. Instead, there is a wide acceptance of Australia's approach to trade as a vehicle for economic growth, job creation and rising living standards. Broad support was expressed for the development of fair trading relationships with all countries and the need to regulate trade through the agreement of international rules. Both in Australia and overseas, a key aspect of community opposition to recent trade agreements has evolved from a lack of transparency and consultation in the treaty-making process, the extension of trade agreements into broader policy areas beyond tariffs and customer arrangements, and a perceived democratic deficit in the treaty-making process.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The committee has recommended that the Australian government should prioritise action to respond to the growing bipartisan and community support for reform of the treaty-making process. A reformed treaty-making process will be an important measure to ensure continued public support for Australia's future trade agreements. I commend the report to the Senate.</span>

                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">
                    <a href="J7Q" type="MemberSpeech">
                      <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Senator BACK</span>
                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Western Australia</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">19:02</span>):  I also rise to speak to the report as presented by the chair, Senator Gallacher, and make the point that the coalition senators placed additional comments but did not dissent at all from the primary report. We had no difficulty with the recommendation on deferring undertaking binding treaty action, because, as the chair has said, the United States of America has at this moment, disappointingly, withdrawn from the process, but we hope that will not be a permanent decision. As to the second recommendation, that of expediting widely supported reforms, I point again to that comment made by Senator Gallacher. <span style="text-transform:uppercase;">A</span>s a member of the Joint Standing Committee on Treaties, we endorse two particular areas in the treaty-making process. The first is the approach to free trade agreement negotiations to permit security-cleared representatives from business and civil society to view the government's position as part of negotiations—remembering that it is within the capability of people here in the parliament by signing a confidentiality agreement, as indeed is the case with the United States and other legislatures. It has been offered, but not accepted, by some members of the committee. The second one, as illustrated by Senator Gallacher, is the provision of independent modelling and analysis of the proposed trade agreements. Coalition senators endorse both of those recommendations.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">But in so doing, I want to make the very strong point that this a trading nation. We are a population of 24 million people in a land mass equal to that of continental USA with the exception of Alaska. We have always relied on external trade. We will continue to rely economically, socially, community-wise and employment-wise on our capacity to trade internationally. It is where we are expert. We are regionally so phenomenally well placed now in the fastest growing area in the world, the Asian region. The 12 partners that undertook these TPP negotiations for five years account for some 40 per cent of world economic activity. Have those who are opposed to the progress of these negotiations on Australia's behalf stopped to think about where Australia might be if we were denied the opportunity to participate in that 41 per cent?</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">But even since the Senate directed the committee to look into this issue, we have now had in the United Kingdom the decision by the UK community to depart from the EU, through what is called Brexit, and that is going to open up both enormous challenges and enormous opportunities for Australia. We need to be flexible and we need to be innovative in our capacity to maximise what were once very lucrative trading opportunities with the UK before they went into the EU. One need only think of the circumstances with the sale of horticultural products out of Senator Polley's home state of Tasmania, with the export of apples and pears that went to the UK markets pre the EU, so there are tremendous opportunities there.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We know that the new President of the United States, President Trump, has at this time taken the United States away from the TPP, at a time when most of the US Congress—Republicans and Democrats, senators and members of the House of Representatives—were in favour of a Trans-Pacific Partnership. I want to draw attention not to the Asian representatives of the TPP, not to New Zealand, with whom we already have a very strong trading relationship, but to our opportunities in Central and South America, our opportunities in Mexico to radically improve free trade between our two countries. We know where the benefits are and will be between ourselves and Mexico: in horticultural products, in dairy products, in wine, in mining products and services, in oil and gas, and in TAFE and higher education. I for one am very strongly, privately and publicly, urging the trade minister to continue what has been started—by this particular chamber, in fact—to actually see where our opportunities lie with Mexico. And of course Peru and Chile are also participants in the TPP.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">For example, concern is expressed about some of the standards. Well, I think the best way to see standards of labour relations, occupational health and safety, and environmental advancement in many of the countries with whom we relate would be through a TPP so that countries like Brunei and Vietnam would have the opportunity to improve in those areas. The investor-state dispute settlement process is one that exercises the minds of a lot of people. Well, I say again, as I have said in this place before: when you have yourself done business and traded in other countries without some degree of protection, the ISDS provision not only exists for others wanting to do business with Australia but also gives Australian business the protection that is necessary when trading and dealing in other countries. That never, ever seems to come to the fore.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">And great discussion went on previously in ISDS relations about the capacity of a tobacco company to take the Australian government through the processes and to get compensation. Well, it is amazing how quiet everybody went when indeed those matters were dealt with and under the ISDS provisions that company failed. For those who are interested, our joint standing committee met in Perth and we had evidence from the lawyer who represented the tobacco company in all of those negotiations. And for those who really genuinely do want some information on ISDS and how it works, his evidence to the committee and his submission is enlightening, and he certainly came away with the view—very strongly, although he represented the other side in that dispute—and the advice to the committee that these are very sound provisions to have in the process.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">So, I conclude my remarks by saying that coalition senators concur with the recommendations that have come through from the report but very, very strongly want to place on record that Australia's interests lie best in continuing our trading relations with other countries. And we need look no further than to the advances and the benefits that have been made in recent times through the excellence of negotiations of then trade minister Andrew Robb in the China-Australia Free Trade Agreement, the Japan-Australia Economic Partnership Agreement and the agreement with South Korea. We are already seeing enormous benefits, which are flowing through to employment, to trading activity, to economic benefit and to further investment. I commend the report.</span>

                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">
                    <a href="I0U" type="MemberSpeech">
                      <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Senator HANSON-YOUNG</span>
                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">South Australia</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">19:10</span>):  I rise to speak on the report of the Foreign Affairs, Defence and Trade Legislation Committee in relation to the TPP. Let me firstly state the obvious: that the Trans-Pacific Partnership is dead. It is dead in the water, and it is time this government accepted that it was a bad deal from the beginning, and it should not in any way try to be revived. And let me say that Australia is a trading nation. But when you look at our trade deficit, you have to wonder what on earth this government and successive governments have been doing to our trade arrangements for the last decade. In 2016—last year—our trade deficit hit $36 billion. So, we are not getting a very good deal at the moment from our negotiators on the government benches in relation to our trade deals—$36 billion in deficit. This is the legacy that is currently being carried by the government.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">And the TPP was only going to add more pain to that. We hear all about the fact that it was meant to create jobs. Well, that is a load of absolute garbage, because we know that no independent assessment has been conducted by the government to back up those claims. In fact, what we have seen instead is analysis that has been conducted by others showing that we would not even get to 0.7 per cent of growth over the next 13 to 15 years. Now, surely that is a rounding error at best. It was going to be bad for Australian jobs and bad for Australian consumers, and it was going to push up the cost of cancer medicine in this country, because who negotiated this trade deal, in secret, behind closed doors? It was the big multinational corporations, stitching this deal up for themselves and wanting it delivered for them as well.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We know that this deal was designed to meet the needs and desires of the big corporations. It had nothing to do with creating a job-rich economy back here in Australia. It had nothing to do with putting the community at the centre. And I must say, it is quite welcoming to hear from the Labor Party that they are willing to talk about opening up and looking at how we reform the treaty-signing process and how we go about signing trade deals, because it is high time we stripped away the secrecy, high time we started putting people and communities back at the centre.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We hear our trade ministers and our Prime Minister from time to time go on and on about how these trade deals are wonderful; they are going to make Australia rich, boost job growth. They never have the facts to back up those statements. In fact, it is the exact opposite: a trade deficit of $36 billion. And the TPP was going to deliver a rounding error at best, over the next 13 to 15 years.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">One of the most insidious parts of this deal was those ISDS clauses—those clauses that were going to allow big multinational companies to sue governments, here in Australia or elsewhere, if a government dared to act in a way that might impact on their profits. We have seen examples of this before: big tobacco coming in and saying, 'How dare the Australian government start saying that they want to do something about cutting down the amount of cigarettes that Australians smoke because they are worried about the health impacts on the community.' How much public money was spent fighting that in the courts because big tobacco were so upset that their profits were going to be hurt by those regulations? What would happen if we wanted to introduce proper, genuine food labelling in this country—whether it was to say how much sugar, how much fat or how healthy or not a product was? What would happen if we wanted to put a genuine made-in-Australia stamp on the front of packets of food? They could then be compared to those foreign products pretending to be made in Australia—when we know, pretty much, that the produce comes from elsewhere. What would those big multinational food corporations say then? 'Oh no, the Australian government and the Australian parliament cannot introduce laws for proper labelling of food, because that might impact on our profits.' So they drag the Australian government through years and years of a court process, sucking up hundreds of millions of dollars of Australian taxpayers' money to fight that out in the courts, even when the parliament has perhaps acted on something that the Australian community wanted. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Those ISDS clauses are inherently and fundamentally undemocratic, and we had this government, the Abbott-Turnbull government, signing Australia up and begging Donald Trump to keep the TPP alive and on the table, despite the fact that it was not going to deliver growth for Australia, that job numbers were not going to go up and that we were going to be trading away our sovereignty, because we would be letting big corporations have the power to sue the government of Australia. Why on earth would the Prime Minister of Australia think that is the one topic to go and beg the new President of the US over? Heavens above, there are a lot of other things coming out of the Trump administration right now, and the one thing that Malcolm Turnbull is desperate to change his mind on is to revitalise and bring back to life the zombie of the TPP. Priorities are absolutely in the wrong place and the wrong order with this Prime Minister. There was no independent analysis. The government have not been able to back up their claims. In fact, every time there was analysis done they wanted to dismiss it. 'Alternative facts' are running riot through the government benches, trying to bring back to life the dead-in-the-water TPP.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">There is still some suggestion from Malcolm Turnbull that we could unscramble the omelette and put the TPP back together in some other way without the United States. Anyone who has looked at this agreement knows you just cannot do that, because the deals are all done on the basis that what people would get and what other countries would get is inherently linked to what concessions the United States would give. It is ludicrous and delusional to think that you could just reinvent the TPP with the US removed. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">So, back to the drawing board. Everything else now needs to be put back on the table. What kind of trade negotiations do we want to see from here on in? We should be seeing trade negotiations that are open, that are transparent to the public, that are backed up by fact, not 'alternative fact', and that have an independent analysis on what impact an agreement would really have on the Australian economy, on Australian jobs and on consumers. We should not be letting our government go into any negotiation meeting without saying, 'We will not agree to any inclusion of the ISDS clauses.' Any government worth their salt who brings in an ISDS clause and agrees to that— <span style="font-style:italic;">(Time expired)</span></span>

                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Senator SMITH</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Western Australia</span>—<span class="HPS-MinisterialTitles">Deputy Government Whip in the Senate</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">19:20</span>):  I rise this evening to briefly note a historic milestone which was reached yesterday, 6 February 2017, and which has been noted around the world over the last 24 hours. Yesterday marked 65 years to the day since Her Majesty Queen Elizabeth II became our sovereign upon the passing of her beloved father, King George VI. As is well known to many people, at the time Her Majesty was a long way from home on an official visit to Kenya. It is impossible to conceive the weight of the burden that fell upon her shoulders that day—she not only lost a parent, which is a traumatic event for anyone, but she immediately became head of a government and head of what is now known as the modern Commonwealth of Nations, with all of the constitutional, legal and moral responsibilities that that carried. That is a significant burden for anyone, but for a 25-year-old it is an almost unimaginable one, no matter how long and intense the preparation may have been. Commonwealth nations, though undoubtedly loyal to the new sovereign, would also have been understandably nervous. However, as the years since have amply demonstrated, those doubts were unfounded. From the first moments of her rule, Her Majesty carried herself with dignity, with grace and with confidence that reflected her devotion to duty. Through extraordinary times and extraordinary challenges, she has maintained that same countenance to this very day.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Queen Elizabeth II has already become our longest-reigning monarch, and yesterday she became the first to reach the milestone of sapphire jubilee—65 years on the throne. When she became Queen, Winston Churchill was living at 10 Downing Street, Harry Truman was in the White House and Robert Menzies was in The Lodge. Today, those positions are respectively occupied by Theresa May, Donald Trump and Malcolm Turnbull. That is but one illustration of just how drastically our world has altered. When the Queen came to the throne, television broadcasts had not yet begun in Australia. Today we can watch live events unfold on the other side of the world in a device we hold in our palm. Air travel was rare, and considered a luxury. Today, many Australians would struggle to do their jobs or maintain family relationships without it.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">But as vastly changed as the Australia of 2017 is from the one that existed 65 years ago, some things have not changed, and that includes the values that make our nation what it is. These are values that are both well understood and embodied by Her Majesty the Queen. She herself articulated them during her first visit to our country in 1954, when she described the Australia she had experienced as one where 'growth and progress are manifest, a country of freedom, eloquent of that true democracy which dignifies and expresses the individual human being.' Whether in 1954 or in 2017, that is a description which most Australians would be proud to hear. Of course, I believe it is the timelessness and universality of those values—and the way the Crown reflects them—that helps to explain the enduring support that our constitutional monarchy enjoys in Australia, particularly, and importantly, among younger Australians. Whatever their background and whatever their political views, we know that Australians admire those who serve our community in whatever capacity they hold, and not even the most ardent republican would try to argue that the life of our Queen has been anything other than one of duty and service beyond self. From Cape Town, South Africa, on 21 April 1947, then Princess Elizabeth made a radio broadcast to mark her 21st birthday. Towards the end of that broadcast, she made a statement which today remains her personal creed:</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Small">I declare before you all that my whole life, whether it be long or short, shall be devoted to your service …</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">For 65 years as our Queen she has remained faithful to that vow, and, for that, all Australians extend their heartfelt appreciation. Thy choicest gifts in store; on her be pleased to pour; long may she reign.</span>

                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Senator LINES</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Western Australia</span>—<span class="HPS-MinisterialTitles">Deputy President and Chair of Committees</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">19:25</span>):  A couple of weeks ago, Senator Leyonhjelm insulted early childhood educators across this country when he blamed the increase in childcare fees on quality standards and the requirement for educators to have a certificate III as a minimum. This, the senator stated, had led to an increase in fees. Tonight I want to correct the record. It would seem that the senator has been rather selective in the issues he chooses to respond to. The low pay of early childhood educators has been covered in the media for the best part of the last five years, and despite there being a requirement for centres and educators to reach standards and hold qualifications that has done absolutely nothing to lift the pay of these professional yet low-paid educators.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">For the record, an educator with a certificate III starts on $20.30 per hour and after three years they reach their highest rate of pay—the highest rate they will ever earn as certificate III workers. That is just $21.99 per hour, a paltry $1.69 per hour increase on their starting rate. This measly amount does not contribute to the high cost of early childhood education. Educators are leaving the sector at alarming rates—more than 30 educators leave the sector each week. They do not really leave—they are forced to leave, not because qualifications are pushing them out but because of the simple fact that they cannot afford to stay. That is the truth of the matter.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Early childhood education is not about 'wiping noses and stopping children from killing one another'—another bland statement made by Senator Leyonhjelm. Academic research informs us that 85 per cent of a child's brain development occurs between birth and five years. The reforms Labor put into place recognise this well-known fact. Early childhood centres are places of education and care. It is obvious to me and the sector that the senator has never spent any time in a quality early childhood centre, and I would suggest he walk a day in the shoes of an early childhood educator before he sounds off again.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Senator Leyonhjelm and indeed the government have got it wrong on early childhood education. Of course it costs, and yes high fees do need to be addressed—not in the way the government wants to do, by taking from one area of our community to give to another, but by recognising that working women make an enormous contribution to our economy. Yet under this government our female workforce participation rates remain in the lowest levels of the developed world. The Grattan Institute has estimated that, if we increased our female workforce participation rate to the rate of Canada, our economy would be $25 billion better off. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">So it is time the government and others looked at the value of early childhood education through a different prism, through the wellbeing of our children, the boost to our economy when women are able to fully participate in our economy and educators earning the professional pay they so well deserve.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Victoria</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">19:29</span>):  There is a long-held saying that the world's forests are its lungs. That being the case, the coalition federal government and the Victorian Labor government just snuck into the tobacconist to buy a carton of cigarettes for a cancer patient.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Over the last 20 years Australia's native forests designated for logging have been exempted from our national environment laws. Even open-cut mines do not get that sort of special treatment. These logging laws, known as regional forest agreements, were meant to protect jobs and protect the environment. They have failed on both counts.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Last Friday was a chance to restore balance, with the expiration of the first of these 10 agreements—the East Gippsland Regional Forest Agreement. This chance was wasted. Despite all the evidence that the industry needs to be brought into the 21st century, like a wink and a nod in a dark car park Prime Minister Turnbull and Premier Andrews quietly extended their failed laws.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I most recently visited these majestic East Gippsland forests three weeks ago. It is invigorating to breathe in the fresh air and to hear cascades of clear water, clean enough to drink straight from the creek. I am proud to have been one of the leaders of the campaign that created the Errinundra National Park, which is in the heart of these forests. It was a win for people over the outdated 'chop it down, ship it out' attitude.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The reality of how regional forest agreements have failed our forests was starkly evident on the edge of the Errinundra National Park three weeks ago. Normal environment protection law does not apply. Great swathes of formerly magnificent forest have been devastated. It is a brutal process conducted by an industry stuck in the past century. When a forest is logged it is cut down and bulldozed. The complex understorey is destroyed, the resulting silt and debris is sent downstream, possums and gliders are thrown from their nesting hollows and wombats are buried alive. Then, just in case any plants or animals have survived, a napalm-like substance is dropped from the sky to scorch the former forest in the name of regeneration. Yes, napalm. No modern industry would use dynamite to go fishing, but the native forest logging industry uses napalm as part of its 'management' regime. All this is for mostly low-value wood products like woodchips and tomato stakes.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Yet Minister Ruston and the Victorian Labor Minister for Energy, Environment and Climate Change, Lily D'Ambrosio, have the gall, in announcing the extension of the agreement, to continue the blatant lie that this is ecologically sustainable forestry. This destruction of complex forest ecosystems is no more ecologically sustainable than clean coal or healthy cigarettes. What is more, the East Gippsland Regional Forest Agreement does not even recognise the important role of these forests in combating dangerous global warming. Each undisturbed hectare of forest holds hundreds of tonnes of carbon, which is many times more than most other forests around the world. And if it is logged, it is gone—literally up in smoke.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The justification for extending the East Gippsland Regional Forest Agreement is the myth that native forest logging can support jobs into the future. The truth is that we subsidise the industry in East Gippsland up to $5½ million a year. We, the taxpayers, are paying for this forest destruction. Just think of how many jobs we could create building walking, horse riding and bike trails and employing local people as custodians of our forests with these millions. Yet the federal and state ministers together talk about delivering sustainable economic growth. It is simply unsustainable to keep propping up this outdated industry at the expense of our native forests. We have got the balance wrong. Governments have failed us, Labor and Liberal alike.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Last Friday was an opportunity to restore the balance: to announce the transition to a 100 per cent plantation-based industry. Eighty-five percent of the wood products industry is already in plantations. It needs to be 100 per cent. We cannot continue the mistake of simply rolling over the destruction of Australia's native forests. Governments on both sides, you are on notice.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-MemberContinuation" style="font-weight:bold;">):</span>  I rise to speak tonight about the failure, once again, of the ABC to service rural and regional Australians, an issue I have canvassed many times in this place. Over many years we have witnessed a systematic deresourcing of services to our regional communities, and the quality of rural journalism itself is suffering as a result. Right now    88 per cent of ABC jobs are located in urban areas. Of course I speak about the decision by the ABC board in December 2016 to not renew its short-wave transmission radio service contract, resulting in the short-wave service being cut off last week. That is, sadly, reflective of the corporation's failure to serve its rural and regional audiences. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Over summer this decision has caused widespread concern and distress throughout the Northern Territory and beyond. Let's not forget that many of our Pacific neighbours, including Papua New Guinea and Vanuatu, also accessed this service prior to its termination. The reported savings for the ABC's $1 billion-a-year budget is $1.9 million—less than 0.2 per cent of the corporation's annual budget. This is an organisation which paid 176 executives over $1.6 million last year in bonuses. This is at what cost to the farmers, workers, rangers, truckies, grey nomads, commercial fishermen and regional and remote Territorians who utilise this service?</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Most concerning is that there is no evidence that in making this decision there was any meaningful effort by the ABC to engage with the Northern Territory community, industry or government to assess the impact the removal of the service may have or to understand how Territorians who do not live in Darwin live and work. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Meeting the needs of rural and regional Australians as a broadcaster needs more than glossy photos in the annual report, board visits to rural towns once a year or expensive celebrations in towns like Yackandandah. The ABC is cherished by rural and regional Australians. It is often our primary source of high-quality news, current affairs and weather. It is our emergency service communication provider. But this latest decision once again highlights that the glossy image is not backed up by consistent engagement with our communities.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Last week I travelled to Darwin and met with the Northern Territory Cattlemen's Association, and heard about the detrimental impact the ABC's decision is having on pastoralists and workers across the Territory. Ms Hayes, the CEO, expressed concern that the ABC had failed to identify how many Territorians utilised its shortwave service prior to making a determination to axe the service. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The Northern Territory has around 220 pastoralists, on huge stations, collectively covering over 50 per cent of the Territory's landmass. These farmers use shortwave radio as their primary communication tool around their homesteads, and when they are out in the bush or doing 500-kilometre bore runs on any given day. They are only using a UHF radio service. They cannot text back to the station. They cannot use the satellite. There is no other way. So they are often out there alone, without any understanding of what is going on in the broader world. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Post the decision, I am encouraged that concerned Territorians have made submissions to the Senate inquiry into my private member's ABC bill into rural and regional advocacy. They have registered their disappointment with the ABC's deeply flawed decision. Mr and Mrs McBean, who own Bonalbo Cattle Company, have owned and lived on cattle stations in the Northern Territory since 1964 and have relied on shortwave transmissions. The ABC shortwave radio has given them a lot of joy and helped them through emergency situations over a long period of time. Those who have travelled across the Great Sandy Desert in Western Australia, the Simpson Desert in the Territory, and the Great Victoria Desert in South Australia and Western Australia, and those remote areas in our country have relied on the ABC shortwave radio program. It is a similar issue for our commercial and recreational fishing fleet, and indeed our Indigenous community in remote areas. Sometimes our radio can be sporadic and hard to hear, but the shortwave is clear as a bell. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">It is simply not good enough. The vast solution, which the ABC said will replace it, is no solution at all. If they had consulted, they would know that. It is a fix solution. It is fine, unless you are in a ute, unless you are on a fishing trawler, unless you are actually moving out and about in remote and regional communities. It is simply not good enough. I urge all Territorians—the committee is coming to Darwin so you will be able to lodge your submission and make sure the ABC management and board are very aware that their lack of consultation has had severe impacts on your ability to access their services, and it is your right as a citizen in this country to have great access to the ABC. </span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Western Australia</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">19:40</span>):  Yesterday's evidence to the Royal Commission into Institutional Responses to Child Sexual Abuse was indeed shocking, and Australians have been deeply angered and upset by those revelations. It is the first time that an Australian arm of the Catholic church has opened its books to reveal the true extent of that abuse over some decades. Importantly, it underlines how significant the royal commission has been in exposing abuse and ensuring survivors get justice. Were it not for the royal commission, that evidence, that opening of the books of the Catholic church, would not have happened. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Many survivors of childhood sexual abuse have been waiting their whole lives for redress for the crimes that were perpetrated against them as children. The Labor Party does understand that nothing can make up for the pain and trauma experienced by survivors of that abuse. But I do want to acknowledge that the royal commission is an important step along the road to justice, and telling the stories and giving visibility to them has been an important part of the road to healing for many survivors, who for too many years were ignored or not believed. Tonight I want to put on record my acknowledgement of all of those extraordinary men and women who survived that horrific abuse and who have shared their painful accounts with the royal commission and indeed put the pressure on churches and other institutional organisations to come forward with their own evidence. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We cannot let the bravery of these people who have told their stories be wasted. We must ensure that the government implements the recommendations of the royal commission. We must act swiftly to implement all of the recommendations when the final report is handed down later this year. As the shadow minister for families and communities, I want to say on behalf of Labor that we are committed to the implementation of these recommendations. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We have already expressed our significant concern about the government's opt-in scheme for redress for this abuse. An opt-in scheme means that only organisations who want to participate in redress will have to do so, and that is simply not good enough. Survivors of these horrific crimes deserve so much more than that. No country should stand by and let perpetrators get away with these crimes. No country should stand by and do nothing to help with the healing of survivors, and that is indeed what would happen if we let people opt-out of redress. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The royal commission is an opportunity for the government to try and right some of these past wrongs and for us to do that as a parliament and to assist in the healing of survivors, and it must include a comprehensive redress scheme. It must also bring us to have some more constructive discussions about government; how government needs to act to ensure that institutions are best positioned to protect children and prevent abuse from occurring. And there are many ways that we will need to work together to make organisations child-safe, and the royal commission is already putting us on notice of the things that need to happen. Indeed, even before they report, they are asking us to implement many of those things.  </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We know from the interim report that there are things that the government can and should be doing now, in the interests of children and child-safe organisations across the country, to prevent this horrific abuse. They include national working with children checks, national child-safe principles and child-focused programs to reduce vulnerability. These are all recommendations which we must put in place sooner rather than later. I want to note that the communique from community services ministers from across the country last year is making some progress but not nearly enough and not nearly urgently enough. I and Labor will be watching closely to ensure that all the recommendations of the royal commission lead to real change and real action.</span>

                  <a href="245759" type="MemberSpeech">
                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Senator WATT</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Queensland</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">19:45</span>):  I rise tonight to speak on yet another massive stuff-up from the Turnbull government, concerning the debacle that has become known as the Shoalwater Bay Defence land expansion. Shoalwater Bay is a Defence training area just north of Rockhampton in Central Queensland, and each year it hosts many Australian and overseas soldiers undertaking training exercises. The process that the government has adopted over the last few months in relation to this is a textbook example of how you do not consult a local community and how you do not handle a massive project that is going to impact on people's lives.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">This process started two days before the last federal election, when, miraculously, the government decided to announce to the people of Central Queensland that it had secured a deal with the Singaporean government which was going to inject over $1 billion of infrastructure upgrades and other economic benefits into the local Central Queensland community. At first blush that sounds fantastic, and, not surprisingly, most people in Central Queensland welcomed that news. It is an area that is struggling with high unemployment, and anything that governments can announce around new jobs and economic opportunities is very much welcomed. But what the government failed to mention at the same time as announcing this expansion was that it all relied upon dozens of compulsory land acquisitions in some of the best cattle farming country in Australia. It is not for no reason that Rockhampton is known as the beef capital of Australia, and the very country that has led to that title being conferred on Rockhampton was exactly what this government was proposing to forcibly acquire, without bothering to tell any of the landowners or businesses that rely on that industry.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Landowners only heard about the intention to forcibly acquire their land in November last year, months after the election and months after that announcement had helped deliver the seat of Capricornia back into LNP hands and helped this government retain office by one seat. Landowners heard about this, not because their local member picked up the phone and talked to them and not because anyone from government talked to them, but because they got officious letters in the mail from the Department of Defence saying, basically: 'Hello, we are going to come along and compulsorily acquire your property. Thanks very much.' Some people did not even get a letter. Some people had to read about it in the newspaper. There are businesses that stood to lose their entire livelihood and that, to this day, have not been spoken to by anyone from this government or anyone from the defence department about their plans.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The landowners and other businesses were not the only people who were surprised about the fact that this big announcement was going to rely on forced land acquisitions; the local LNP member, Michelle Landry, did not have a clue what was going on either. She actually went on TV news recently saying that she was completely in the dark. What kind of member of parliament has no idea about a major development that is going to go on in their electorate and is not all over it, giving information to their constituents? Of course, there was a marked change in the government's attitude to all this after the Labor Party took up the cause of these landowners and businesses, and they were certainly prompted into action. Despite that, we saw continued mass confusion caused by the fact that the government could not get their story straight. Day after day, you would have Michelle Landry, the member for Capricornia, out there saying that it was going to need forced land acquisitions, and the defence minister would be saying the same thing. Then, last week, we had the Prime Minister saying that he directed the department to look at alternatives. No-one spoke to the landowners about that; the Prime Minister just told his mate Tim Nicholls, the state LNP leader. Then last Friday we had the Minister for Resources and Northern Australia, the Central Queensland based Senator Matt Canavan, in the media saying that compulsory acquisitions were going to be needed. Later that morning, the Deputy Prime Minister was in the media saying that there were not going to be any forced acquisitions. It was no wonder that people were so confused about what was happening. Now, today, we finally had the government announce that there will not be any forced acquisitions. It is about time they made this announcement and put people out of their misery and relieved the stress that has been caused by the government's incompetence.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I pay tribute to the local community for taking up the fight to the government. I and many other people in the Labor Party, state and federal, have been very pleased to stand side by side with them and to help them get the answers that they need. Unfortunately, there are still many unanswered questions, which we will be pursuing in the parliament. We do not know what is going to be happening to businesses that will be adversely affected by an expansion undertaken by voluntary acquisitions and whether those businesses can expect compensation. We will be continuing to ask questions of the government.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">South Australia</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">19:50</span>):  Tonight, Senator Bernardi is preparing to take his seat alongside the great political visionaries of history. Gandhi, Winston Churchill, Martin Luther King, Nelson Mandela—sure, they were okay, but now, thankfully, the world is being given the gift of Cory and his Australian Conservatives. Heavy on rhetoric but light on detail, Senator Bernardi has been pretty tight-lipped today about what his shiny new party will actually stand for, what their policies might be and what principles they will hold dear. Perhaps in his unquestionable wisdom, Senator Bernardi has decided that the Australian people are just not ready for his genius. Maybe that is for the best, because you never know. Just imagine the policies or the commandments that would make up his narcissistic manifesto. Maybe something like, 'I am the lord,' by Cory. 'There shall be no other Corys before me.' 'Though shalt honour thy father and thy mother'—of course, not thy father and thy other father. 'Though shall not lie'—but of course you can still use alternative facts. 'Thou shalt not covet thy neighbour's ass'—or any other pets or livestock. Say what you want about his policy platform, but one thing is clear: Senator Bernardi is trying something new. It is visionary. It is exciting. Racist, looney, homophobic, climate sceptic, reactionary, right-wing politics—it is new. Well, of course for Pauline Hanson, Tony Abbott, obviously, Geert Wilders, Donald Trump—</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">There was a lot of speculation of what was going to happen during today's big announcement. And, boy, didn't Senator Bernardi milk the media frenzy for everything it was worth. But, of course, Senator Bernardi disappointed the expectant nation when he declared, 'I won't be changing.' What a letdown that was. What a steaming pile of garbage this political party-cum-vanity project is really going to be. It is little more than the watered-down, hyper-American rubbish imported from overseas that was already old when Pauline Hanson, the leader of One Nation, started it years ago.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">It is pretty clear what has happened here. The Liberal Party made a serious mistake when they packed up little Cory's lunchbox and sent Senator Bernardi off to the US in the middle of the hyper-Trump election just a few months ago. He has come back with some refried right-wing crap; he has drunk the Trump cordial. And he is desperate to paint himself as the poor man's Trump. How pathetic! At least if you are going to try and build a career in a new political party out of demonising the most vulnerable in our community and tricking the hard done-by into thinking you actually give a damn and you will represent them, be original about it. Don't just try to mimic an old orange blowhard from America. Even his red cap isn't new; it is borrowed.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Let's be honest: this is all about Senator Bernardi; it is not about Australia; it is not even about this place; it is not even about the Liberal Party. This is all about Senator Bernardi. His brave new political movement is nothing more than self-interested opportunism from the very definition of a political insider. He has sorely underestimated the good people of South Australia. I think he will be in for a nasty surprise. South Australians do not want another homophobic bigot. They do not want another climate sceptic. He is going to cop it hard when he tries to ask for their support at the ballot box. South Australians want people who are willing to stand up for vulnerable, stand up for the environment, stand up for our diverse and emerging economies, stand up for renewal energy— <span style="font-style:italic;">(Time expired)</span></span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">
                  <a href="2O4" type="MemberSpeech">
                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Senator HINCH</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Victoria</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">19:55</span>):  I stand here tonight to follow up on a shocking medical scandal in this country. In an adjournment speech last November I brought up the issue of a health problem that had crippled hundreds of women. I now discover it is thousands of Australian women. I said at the time that I believed it was the biggest medical scandal in this country since the thalidomide tragedies of the late 1950s and 1960s. Sadly, it was not hyperbole; I was not exaggerating.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">During our break, I have corresponded with and met with more victims of a scourge known as transvaginal mesh—the polypropylene sling used on women, mainly mothers, for incontinence and prolapse conditions; women as young as 30. Since that Senate speech I have been flooded with emails and tweets from victims from all over the world—the United States, Canada and the UK. In Scotland they have banned, or at least suspended, the use of this mesh. I have read more of their case histories. Some of the side-effects have been infection, bleeding, painful sexual intercourse, vaginal scarring. The pain of daily living has included stabbing pain when sitting on the toilet, when crawling into bed, when walking and even when sitting at a desk.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Last month in Sydney I sat with a mesh victim—30-year-old former legal secretary Joanne Mannion. I say 'sat'; she perched in pain on the edge of a chair until after about 50 minutes she could not sustain it. She had come in from Cronulla to meet me. I saw her pain and offered her a cab fare home. Her response really hit me. She said, 'Thanks, but no thanks. I'd rather take the train because it's more comfortable standing up.' Her pain was so relentless, her condition so debilitating that she sold her apartment to get the $50,000 needed to fly to the US, where one doctor has had some success in removing mesh which is more than embedded. It is now fused with damaged nerves and muscles. In a vulgar simile, I admit, it would be like trying to remove rusting chicken wire from a hen house which has had vines and weeds growing over it for years.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">There are now grave concerns about not only the mesh—which is breaking down and floating around victims' bodies—but the metal anchoring hooks that have been harshly and permanently implanted in muscles in the buttocks, pelvis and thighs. It goes on and on. As I said in November, it is a national disgrace and it must be stopped.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">There are heaps of questions that must be answered. Why would the TGA allow surgeons to permanently implant a life-threatening device into a woman's body. Why would a surgeon embrace this technique so enthusiastically? What safety and efficacy trials were run? Aren't such devices meant to be made of inert materials? They started using versions of these mesh slings here in around 2000. It may have gone back as far as 1996. The TGA began monitoring the mesh in 2008 after complaints. The FDA issued a warning several years later, and mesh manufacturer Johnson &amp; Johnson withdrew some products in 2012. In 2013, the TGA launched a more extensive investigation of about 100 products. In 2014-15, about 80 those products were withdrawn.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I believe there must be at least a moratorium on the use of this mesh. There must be a Senate inquiry. One of biggest problems, I believe, is that mainstream media—and maybe this applies as well to some politicians—are either ignorant of the issue or maybe they are embarrassed because it includes the word 'vagina'. 'It is a women's plumbing thing; it is secret women's business.' I even had a senior radio producer tell my staff it was not an appropriate issue for me to raise when they wanted to know what topics I was going to talk about, even though women probably make up a majority of the station's listeners. That is why I applaud the <span style="font-style:italic;">Herald Sun</span> in Melbourne, and other News Limited papers around the country, who featured recently a story about it under the headline 'Outcry over implant: Inquiry mooted as class action takes on pharma giant'. The 'inquiry mooted' is the one that I am pushing for, and the 'class action' is being run by Shine Lawyers, who are going to court against Johnson &amp; Johnson later this year in a case that will run for more than 20 weeks.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">
                  <span style="font-style:italic;" />It is now estimated that 100,000 Australian women are carrying this plastic time bomb. At least 4,000 are damaged. I suspect the figure could go as high as 10,000. In the United States the number of women taking legal action is 107,000. In this country, women in pain are being told by their GPs that it was psychosomatic or that it was just some postnatal depression. Women were never told the size of the risks. I know of one case where a surgeon glibly told a patient that the surgery was 'virtually a walk in the park'. He said, 'Within weeks you'll be like a 16-year-old again.' This has caused marriages to break up, families to be shattered and bank accounts to be depleted because the victims cannot work. I say to you again: it is one of the greatest medical scandals. We have a new federal health minister, and I tell you: Minister Hunt, I am coming to get you. <span style="font-style:italic;">(Time expired)</span></span>

The world has been shocked—indeed, it has been appalled—by the division, the hate-mongering and the racism expressed by President Donald Trump and exemplified through the ban to prevent people from migrating to America from seven Muslim-majority countries. For all of our many flaws, both Australia and indeed the United States share a very, very proud history—a proud tradition—of welcoming people from all over the world, and especially welcoming those people most in need of protection and those people most in need of our help.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">In November I shared one young Melbourne woman's experience of being a recent immigrant and the everyday racism that she was subjected to. Today I would like to share with the parliament another young woman's recent experience of institutionalised racism. This is a woman called Sara. She was born in Iran, grew up in Australia and now lives in California. She recently wrote an open letter to the Prime Minister, and in it she describes her experience of President Trump's visa ban. She says:</span>

                <span class="HPS-Small">This ban isn't abstract. It's hurting real Australian families … I've been living and working in the US for the last few years. I met an incredible man. We got married and are expecting our first child in 10 weeks. Every time I think of our child's shared Jewish and Muslim heritage it makes me smile.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Small">Last week I booked a ticket for my mum to be here for the birth of our baby. Like me, my mum is an Australian citizen who was born in Iran. The ban applied to her - because of where she was born.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Small">In Donald Trump's mind, the fact that I was born in Iran is a crime that means I'm less worthy of basic dignity or the rights that others enjoy.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">This is the real world impact of the proposal that is being put forward by Donald Trump. What he is saying to the world as the President of the United States of America is that people of one religion are inherently inferior to another religion—that people born in some countries are not as worthy as people born in others. It is the epitome of bigotry and racism. We here in Australia should be rejecting that kind of racism—that kind of bigotry—no matter where it is and no matter who it comes from. Our political leaders should be joining in and showing the sort of leadership that we are seeing in the rest of the world and joining in to call out this dangerous bigotry and racism for what it is worth and what it is.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">It is ironic that we have a government funded campaign. It is called 'RACISM. IT STOPS WITH ME'. This is the federal government's attempt to talk to the Australian community about how critical it is to stamp out racism, no matter where it is and no matter who it comes from. Yet here in Australia we have our own version, a much harsher version, of the Trump ban. We have a Prime Minister who wants to ban 1,200 innocent people languishing in detention on Nauru and Manus Island from ever coming to this country because they were born in places which meant they had few options other than to get here by boat. This policy from this government around the US deal to look after these 1,200 innocent people creates more uncertainty and more hardship for innocent people. The Prime Minister must bring the people currently languishing on Nauru and Manus Island here to Australia. Let us remember that racism is not okay, whether it be by Donald Trump or someone on the bus. It causes real harm to people, and, if it is going to stop, we all have a responsibility to call it out and reject it.</span>

                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Senator BACK</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Western Australia</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">20:06</span>):  I have long been a lone voice in this place highlighting the unjustifiable and unsustainable failings of the large-scale Renewable Energy Target. Well, the chickens have come home to roost. Everybody now realises that Australia is at a crossroads, and energy policy is right in the middle of it. We have to do something. We know very well that Australia's postwar prosperity was dependent on the fact that we had a reliable source of cheap energy, and nowhere was this better evident than in South Australia where, under Premier Playford, they organised and ensured cheap, coal-fired power. They attracted manufacturing in naval shipbuilding and car manufacturing, and the place was the envy of Australia. Contrast that with today, where the cost of power to South Australians, when you look at forward spot power prices, is in many instances three times the cost of power in Victoria. It is $152 per megawatt versus $55. But Victoria is catching up, as is Queensland, and that will happen nationally if Mr Shorten is ever allowed to get his way with 50 per cent.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">What has happened in South Australia, as you know, Mr Acting Deputy President Gallacher, is that their reliance on intermittent wind power has turned into a disaster for households, schools, miners and business. We now have businesses putting off staff or closing because of the doubling of power costs. Only this week did we see BAEconomics come out with the statement that the bill to prop up green power will hit $3 billion this year. The cost of the subsidies, of course, will be borne right throughout the country.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">To put it into some perspective, the target currently for renewable energy in 2017 is 26,000 gigawatt hours. We are currently on 16,000. What is the cost of getting the next 10,000? It is horrific. The estimates are that if we continue this mad subsidy towards wind power we will be looking at some $40 billion in costs which will go straight on to consumers. If Australians think power costs are bad now, they have not seen anything yet. That is not to speak of the inconvenience of the power blackouts in South Australia, which I publicly and nationally predicted in June last year would happen.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The Renewable Energy (Electricity) Act requires an electricity retailer to purchase a prescribed number of what are called renewable energy certificates and, having purchased them, surrender them to the Clean Energy Regulator. If you do not do it, the current fine is $65 per megawatt hour. By the time that is taxed up, because it is a fine, the $65 becomes $92. Guess where the $92 goes? It goes straight onto the consumer's bill. Only recently we saw ERM Power decide that, instead of purchasing the renewable energy certificates, they would pay a fine to the regulator. So there were no reductions in carbon dioxide emissions. The regulator is now very upset and is threatening criminal sanctions against ERM. It goes without saying that the decision will obviously be in favour of the most equitable activity to undertake. But remember that a fine does not allow tax deductibility. So once they send out their bill to consumers those businesses that would claim the GST back cannot do so on that component.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The large-scale renewable energy scheme has proven to be a costly failure. The scheme was never intended to act as an unchecked single industry subsidy. One of the ways we could alleviate the burden on consumers is to amalgamate the renewable energy certificates into the highly successful Australian carbon credit units which are driving our direct action activities under this coalition government. They are the process by which we will achieve the targets that have been set and agreed to.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">As a South Australian would know, Mr Acting Deputy President, a reliable, secure and affordable electricity supply is what Australia needs and what every Australian has the right to expect if we are going to live equitably and if we are going to have the jobs, growth and prosperity that this Turnbull government is driving. But we know where we are at the moment. We know that there is an unreliable and expensive source of electricity. We know that South Australia is an example of failure. We see that Victoria and Queensland are heading the same way. This evening I want to share that concern.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We know that the current policy settings, including the structure of the National Electricity Market, are not conducive to baseload generators. Let me tell you a little bit about them. If normally a baseload generator is undertaking some 30 megawatts per hour they must register and be what are referred to as 'scheduled generators'. What happens with wind and solar? It is a nice little deal, if you do not mind. They are actually called 'semi-scheduled'. Do you know what that means? It means they do not have to commit to what they say they will generate. That is in contrast to the United States of America where, if they contract to supply electricity to a retailer, they are contractually bound to so do. But here in Australia the legislation was so badly written that in fact the wind turbine operators get the phenomenal benefit at the expense of the Australian taxpayer of renewable energy certificates which at the moment you can buy for about $88 per certificate . It is not bad if you can get them, given the fact that they were about $35 in only January of 2015. Who holds them? Who holds them all? I will tell you who holds them. Yes, a lot of the big electricity generators hold them, but so do the banks and so do other investors. If you got in on the ground floor at $35 when they are now worth $88 and on their way to $92 or $93, it is not a bad deal. But that wind or solar generator who has the opportunity to do a deal and a power purchase agreement with a retailer can say, 'Oh, by the way, I want those renewable energy certificates but I do not have to commit to actually providing you with the power that I have told you I will provide.'</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">So the first thing that has to happen to fix up this lamentable situation is to require those wind turbine generators to actually be fully committed and to be referred to as 'scheduled generators'. That is the first requirement we need. We need to force them to nominate in advance how much power they intend to deliver, when they intend to deliver it and, indeed, for how long.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Mr Acting Deputy President, you know as well as I do that if you were to look at power generated from tides you could predict out 100 years what tidal activity was going to be. Why we are not exploiting this in the northwest of Western Australia is beyond me. If you were to have a look at wave action you could predict literally 24 hours to 48 hours in advance what wave activity was going to be. If you look at power generated from coal or LNG, you know 100 per cent not only how much power but also the quality of that power that is going to be available to you. That is what the Australian community expects and requires—reliable, affordable, sustainable power, and not the nonsense that has led your state of South Australia into the economic demise in which it finds itself now. A simple rule change would lead to a level playing field and allow all generators the opportunity of providing affordable power safely and reliably irrespective of the weather. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I have made the point again and again over time: how is it that a country the geographic size of America without Alaska and a population that of greater New York can be as wealthy per capita as we are. No, it is not wool off the sheep's back—it has not been since the 1950s. No, it is not iron ore or coal. It is two words—and you knew about it in South Australia under Playford—and those two words are: cheap energy. That alone is what gave Australia the advantage that enabled us to enjoy what we enjoy in this country today. Tasmania has been fortunate with hydro-electricity—we see of course the Snowy Hydro scheme—and we should continue to promote them. This country, this taxpayer, this business, this industry, these miners expect a supply of reliable power. It will not come from wind. We need to stop that nonsense.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Tasmania</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">20:16</span>):  I rise in support of the aquaculture industry, and in particular the salmon industry in my home state of Tasmania. I stand side by side with the many Tasmanians and their families who work in this proud industry for their livelihoods.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Aquaculture now provides more than 50 per cent of the world's seafood and it is acknowledged around the world as being the fastest growing food sector, with global production expected to double by 2030. Sustainable aquaculture will be fundamental in providing sustainable food solutions for global populations. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The aquaculture industry now has a gross annual production value of more than $625 million to the Tasmanian economy. With more than 80 per cent of the product sold domestically, the possibility for export expansion is significant. According to industry, at current rates, salmonid production is expected to grow to be worth more than $1 billion annually by 2030. The aquaculture industry's economic contribution to my home state cannot be underestimated. Independent economic analysis shows that on average annual turnover or total value of industry production exceeds $1.1 billion. Therefore the economic impacts are great, and we are proud of these statistics.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Tasmania's primary industries, including the aquaculture industry, are the engine room of Tasmania's economy. From pretty humble beginnings just 20 years ago, the Tasmanian salmon industry now generates 5,200 Tasmanian jobs and 5,000 spin off jobs. These are jobs in high need areas and most of them are full-time jobs in regional areas. The fact is that this industry has the potential to support many more local families.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Tasmania has five large primary producers of high-quality fish—Tassal, Huon Aquaculture, Saltas, Van Diemen Aquaculture and Petuna. Recently, these companies have been under attack from the Greens working in conjunction with Let's Grow Tasmania's Future and Graeme Wood, who have admitted to funding their campaign against the industry. Mr Wood is very well known to the Greens. He donated $1.6 million to them in 2011 and then a further $130,000 to the Tasmanian Greens during last year's federal election campaign. And then we have Mr Andrew Wilkie, who has also been speaking out against this very valuable and important industry—it is pretty typical of Mr Wilkie that he likes to have a bob each way. He, along with the Greens and Mr Wood, is hell-bent on destroying the salmon industry. They are determined to demonise the industry; they seem determined in undermining the many jobs and families that this industry employs in important regional areas, where we need those jobs. Those jobs have the ability of keeping young Tasmanians in those rural areas.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The fact is that this industry is a world leader. The industry is known around the world for having world's best environmental practice and is regularly contacted by international companies for advice on sustainability measures.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">In 2015, the Senate inquiry found that: environmental concerns raised were not supported by expert advice and objective scientific data; the state government was overseeing a comprehensive and robust monitoring regime; and the evidence provided to the committee about the impacts of the industry in no way justified extra bureaucratic measures or more onerous regulations. They were the findings of the inquiry.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Tasmania is known nationally and globally for its clean, green product and we are proud as a state to produce such high quality Atlantic salmon and ocean trout for people at home and abroad. Tasmania's brand power is second to none, and we understand that aquaculture has the potential to significantly power our state's future economic growth.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The former state Labor government approved the expansion of salmon farming in Macquarie Harbour and the federal Labor government invested $7 million towards the Macquarie Harbour Aquaculture Hub—a project that is creating hundreds of jobs and growth in regional Tasmania. The Gillard government also made a $16 million investment in fishery and aquaculture research and development nationally. Labor is very proud, and we have every right to be, of this industry and we are committed to supporting it.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">EMRS market research found late last year that 85 per cent of Tasmanians have either a positive or neutral attitude towards the aquaculture industry, while 92 per cent consider that farmed salmon has significant economic benefits for the state and that salmon farming provides important training and employment opportunities for local communities. Close to three quarters of respondents—74 per cent in total—were in support to some degree of the expansion of the salmon industry, which is great news. This only strengthens the social license for this superb Tasmanian industry, an industry, I might add, that is now independently regulated by the Environmental Protection Agency. It should also be noted that the state government has also strengthened enforcement mechanisms to enable fines to be imposed for environmental pollution that are a true deterrent.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I want to talk about some Tasmanians who proudly rely on this industry. Bernice Bott lives at Surges Bay and has worked in the aquaculture industry for 20 years. She has worked with Tassal for a combined 13 years—six years at Dover and nearly seven years at Huonville. Ms Bott enjoys her job very much. She is very proud of her job. She is proud of the companies she has worked for and she is proud of the international recognition that the industry has. The industry is very important not only to Ms Bott but also to five other members of her family. That is five members of one family that all derive their income and self-esteem from being employed in their local area. I know that Ms Bott and so many other families are proud to be working in this important industry.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">There is also Trish, the owner of the Dover Hardware Store. Her late husband, Gary, started in the aquaculture industry over 30 years ago at the Saltas farm near Hawkers Point Dover. He was one of the first employees of Tassal and actually did the dive to secure the first mooring. They know the value of aquaculture because that impacts on their small business. They know the value of this industry and they, along with tens of thousands of other Tasmanians, are not going to allow the Greens to destroy yet another industry that is so important to the Tasmanian economy. Salmon farming has allowed our community's young people to stay and work in their own area as well as encourage them to get additional skills and to further their education.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The Australian Workers Union has been steadfast in its support for the industry. Mr Ian Wakefield, the secretary of the AWU, has been at the forefront of raising this as an issue and has been supporting his members in this important industry. It has been picked up nationally and I am very proud, along with my Labor colleagues, to be here in this chamber tonight speaking about this important industry. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">But history has shown that success cannot be taken for granted. If consumers lose faith in the product, and that is what the Greens are hoping, then that would be detrimental not only to this industry but to the entire community. That is why the Australian Workers Union has started a campaign to build support for the salmon industry, to protect Tassie aquaculture jobs. The campaign says 'Tassie Salmon: Our Jobs. Our Future' and is raising awareness about the success of this industry. Over 1,100 people have signed an online pledge to support the industry, and families across the state are engaging in the Facebook and twitter campaigns, with over 1,800 people following the AWU campaign through Facebook.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">As I said, this is an extremely important industry to the Tasmanian economy and, I have to say, it is an industry that has crosspartisan support. The state Liberal government in Tasmania supports this industry. They were there with us when we rallied for support in Hobart just over a week ago along with Labor. I sincerely hope that we will have a contribution at some stage from the Liberals Tasmanian senators to support this enormously important industry. We should be supporting Tasmanian jobs. We should be supporting those Tasmanian jobs in rural and regional areas of Tasmania. This industry is too important and I, for one, am not going to stand by and allow the Greens to destroy another economically important industry in Tasmania.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Western Australia</span>—<span class="HPS-MinisterialTitles">Australian Greens Whip</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">20:26</span>):  I rise today to read parts of a letter I recently received from a mother who lost her son to suicide following his struggle with depression. The mother wrote to me hoping to draw attention to the gaps in mental health care in this country that her son</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">experienced first-hand. I have her permission to read this letter but I have been asked not to identify herself or her son. She said:</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Small">My son was 28 years old, gainfully employed, living independently with strong friendships.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Small">I am writing to you as a mother who has been alongside her son as he navigated the mental health care system. My ultimate hope would be that the number of individuals and families affected by suicide is reduced through the timely and intensive treatment management approach to individuals affected by depression and other mental health conditions across the board but particularly for our young men who statistically are one of the highest at risk groups in our community.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">She then went onto say:</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Small">Age 8 he was diagnosed and treated for attention hyperactivity disorder (14% go onto develop Borderline Personality Disorder, versus 3% for general population), highlighting the need for skilled early assessment and intervention for children diagnosed with this condition.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Small">Age 13 he experienced his first episode of depression and was treated by child and adolescent mental health services. He required a term off school and medication and short term therapy to which he responded well.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Small">In September 2013, aged 25 my son was taken by me to a hospital after a failed suicide attempt. At that time after being assessed and deemed safe he was discharged and admission was not recommended. He commenced anti-depressants and anxiolytics and was supported by local community mental health services with follow up psychiatric appointments, which I attended with him.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Small">But his mood continued to deteriorate and the CAT team became involved with a home supervision plan that included twice daily visits for a 2 week period. At this time he was being managed and treated for a major depressive episode. He had significant weight loss and a very strong and ruminating wish to die. This was an extremely difficult time for me as his mother to sit with and see the mental anguish of your only child and to feel powerless to affect change.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Small">At the end of the 2 week supervision I had returned home (he was living with his father) and he attempted suicide again at his first opportunity. The CAT team were called, and he was taken again to hospital. This time, he was to be admitted under the mental health care act as an involuntary patient, at which I felt an enormous relief. Unfortunately, they had no available beds, and he was transferred to another hospital where there was a vacancy.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Small">To my absolute disbelief, they discharged him from that facility less than 24 hours later, making their decision based primarily on his 'borderline personality diagnosis' which had not been discussed with us, his parents. I have read the health services policy guidelines re admission for patients with borderline personality and am deeply troubled. There is little accommodation for dual diagnosis. In my son's case, it was clearly evident that his depression and anxiety was an issue that needed an intensive inpatient approach, to provide close supervision, observation, medical review and access to therapeutic interventions in a safe environment. It was also apparent that the psychiatrists at the two hospitals had differing opinions re my son's primary diagnosis on admission, and so their care plans differed. When I tried to voice my concerns regarding the decision made at the second hospital, I was not able to speak with his treating doctor and was told I had no recourse. His diagnosis of borderline personality disorder, if that is what he had, should not have prevented him from receiving an admission and adequate treatment of his depressive episode. On reflection, it seems that decisions at times can be prejudicial and discriminatory when individuals with acute psychological distress present and are in desperate need of care.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Small">He had lived with his undiagnosed mental health issue for some time, but his depressive episode was a distinctly separate issue. My son lived with ADHD disorder every day, and it presented its own unique challenges for him and his family, but this depressive episode was a distinctly different and marked episode that, in my mind, was inadequately managed and treated at this time by the second hospital.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Small">We were not involved in the discharge planning, though we are his next of kin. Yet on admission to the first hospital the family input was highly valued and seen as an important part of my son's welfare. A referral to Spectrum was not made by the second hospital that I am aware of, as I was not involved in the discharge care planning, so services of this specialised organisation were not made available. The experience of having no voice regarding his discharge planning when he was discharged from the second hospital was gut-wrenching and completely unacceptable. It would not be an acceptable practice in any other area of medicine, and psychiatry should not be any different. This was the only period in his life that he accessed the public hospital system for mental health issues.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Small">If my son had presented with chest pain instead, he would have been admitted and been provided with the most intensive care plan under the supervision of a cardiologist and would not have been discharged until his medical condition was assessed, investigated fully and treated. Family and or carers are involved in this process as a universally deemed mode of best practice. They would not prevent his admission based on his borderline personality disorder, and neither should psychiatry.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">She then went on to say:</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Small">My son mattered, as do all those sons, daughters, brothers, sisters, mothers and fathers who now and in the future will be trying to gain access to the mental health care they deserve.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Small">Australia ranks 26 out of 34 of our OECD countries for psychiatric beds per 100,000 population. One has to ask why that is. The National Mental Health Commission report and the recommended shift of 1 billion dollars away from public acute-care beds to expand community mental health programs is a disaster waiting to unfold. No money should be taken away until the community based sub-acute beds are in place and increased funding is needed urgently for acute inpatient beds to address the current shortages.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">She then went on to say:</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Small">I believe if he had received an inpatient stay of sufficient length to monitor, medicate and engage in a therapeutic process with a well-planned and integrated discharge plan, with case managed follow up, I may not be writing this letter today. My son was denied, I believe, optimal care, and now we are left with the results of that. My son's death has impacted his immediate family, friends and wider community. To have this level of care in what is considered one of the wealthiest countries in the world is appalling and behoves change.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">She concluded:</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Small">I know I am not alone in my perception of our current mental health service being in crisis. One only has to look at the news reports, articles and opinions of those involved directly or indirectly with the system to realise that major review and change is required urgently.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">You can hear I am struggling with my voice, but I had promised this mother that I would read this letter tonight. I urge the Senate to take this on board. Our mental health system needs fixing. It needs an injection of funding. I urge everybody involved—in particular, governments allocating resources—to allocate the resources that are needed to fix our mental health system.</span>

                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Senator ROBERTS</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Queensland</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">20:36</span>):  As a servant to the people of Queensland and Australia, I would like to convey my feelings of pride and the way I have been inspired and excited and raised with hope from visiting with people across south-west Queensland during the summer break. Across 2,000 kilometres of Queensland, from the coast across to near the South Australian border, covering various climates and topographic regions, I have inspired by the Queenslanders I have been listening to, starting with farmer Trevor Cross and his wife, Wendy, in Bundaberg; moving to the vineyard of Tony Brierley of Brierley Wines at Childers; the butcher at Biggenden, Eddie Chandler and his wife at the post office at Biggenden, a family business; and Poppy and Robyn Cross at Mondure, a sawmiller and timber getter—a real character; Poppy should be a national treasure.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We had an evening dinner there, hosted by Poppy and Robyn, with food brought by the local farmers and town folk. Then we went on to Mike and Andrea, cotton farmers and beef graziers, along with their friend from a neighbouring property, and then had down-to-earth conversations with David Wheelahan, a Dalby automechanic. We then moved west to Chinchilla and met Hamish and his wife, who own and run the McDonald's at Chinchilla, a very new establishment. He is a very proud chairman of the Chamber of Commerce and Industry at Chinchilla. And then we met Tyson Golder, the Maranoa Regional Council's mayor at Roma, who took us to listen to butchers and cafe owners, and Bruce Garvie at the Royal Hotel, a very enterprising entrepreneur. And we went to the little town of Mitchell, to a bakery.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Then we went to Bonus Downs, a cattle property and farm stay hosted by Madonna and Lyle Connolly and their son, Grant. We learned about their cattle property and the problems and challenges they face. We met Sharon Lohse who for 12 years has fought for property rights, as well as her daughter, Amy. We had a lovely evening meal with locals from the local properties, and their relatives. We then met with Nigel and Rosemary Brumpton, sheep farmers—meat and wool—near Mitchell. And then we went further out west, to Charleville, and met with Annie Liston, the mayor, and Neil Polglase, the CEO. We met with the owner of the sheep and goat abattoir there, whose name I have forgotten. Then, due to an illness, I visited the emergency room at the Charleville hospital, where I was given fabulous care by Sarah and Bridget and the emergency room doctor, whose name I have forgotten, unfortunately, but it was really down to earth care.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I would like to share with you some of the things I have learned. At Mondure I met with cotton farmers Mike and Andrea. They have developed a cotton farm through water management allocations, a scientific approach to management measuring all facets of the crop and its growth, taking responsibility for their lives and their products, watching markets and prices through the internet daily, sometimes hourly, and coming up with the idea of multi-peril insurance instead of subsidies. They do not have any employees there, because of the red tape and the taxation. But they have invested massively there. They do it all: harvesting, planting and ploughing—no employees; they do it all. That was a theme we saw recurring in the agricultural industry.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">And I mentioned Poppy and Robyn at Mondure earlier on in the list of names. They brought on an evening with their friends and their relatives from town and neighbouring properties, and every single person echoed what Cory Bernardi said this morning and we have been saying for a while: people disillusioned with politicians and politics—all of them—but delighted to see a politician actually out listening, and they appreciated that I understood the taxation issues they face. They are being crippled by tax and red tape that is cutting employment.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Then we met with David Wheelahan, a mechanic in the town of Dalby, who is finding that technology is also confronting him, because, as cars become better and stainless steel takes over exhaust systems, he does not have to do the replacement work and the repair work. So he is looking at ways of improving cars and providing a service that gives customers the best facilities he can.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Hamish, the chairman of the local chamber of commerce, said that Chinchilla is facing a gas price slump but the town is obsessed with making the town better to live in, especially the chamber. He says, quite rightly, that business is fundamental to community life and to the quality of life. Unfortunately, as the price of gas has gone down, crime is increasing, but it is still a wonderful place for families to live, and there is the potential of the Condamine River. But, again, it is difficult, even though there is a gas downturn, to get people to work there. They had to import four Indians to work in their local McDonald's, and they find the Indians wonderful people to work with.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Perhaps for me the highlight of the trip was meeting Tyson Golder, the mayor of the Maranoa Regional Council. That was a real highlight because he ran on a ticket of localising regional council, and that has become very popular with the people. It develops accountability and information and connection for the people who are giving the service to the people who are overseeing the service to the people who actually receive the service. What we see in amalgamation of councils is dis-economies of scale, because of the disconnection of information. He also echoed tax systems. He showed me a cafe where the owner was being squeezed by the GST because all of his costs accrue GST but he cannot pass it on. They are being hit with drugs—ice in particular.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">And the Royal Hotel: what an amazing building, in the middle of Roma—a brand-new investment there by Bruce Garvie, really based on the customer. It was one of the best meals we have ever had—a delicious sauce that could have been something we got in Paris. Again, listening to people in the pub: the biggest saleyards in Australia, sophisticated ways of moving cattle. Again, a downturn in the price of gas is hurting the town. But it was wonderful seeing a great, stormy cloud covering the whole of the sky to the west and the north-west and bringing rain, and the smell of the rain in the dry Roma area.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">In listening to the people of south-west Queensland, there are many opportunities to learn about future state policies and perhaps even federal policies, because de-amalgamation is necessary in many areas, because we need to give the power back to the local people and give them the accountability and the control. That is a lesson for all of us in this parliament: to move services out of the Commonwealth's responsibility and back to the state's responsibility and to get the work done closer to the people, because that is where the information is; that is where the needs are understood. A very impressive mayor is Tyson Golder, in touch with the people and with a vision of serving the people, a combination of retailing experience and management—customer service—and a grazier who is in touch with the people in the area.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We visited Mitchell, where there is a wonderful bakery, and then we went to Bonus Downs, a property that is hosting people from the city for overnight stays and even holidays. The owners were delightful, friendly people, and there was a wonderful barbecue at night. There I learnt a really big lesson that contradicted what I had always assumed. I saw it, because farmers have been telling me this for a while. Instead of planting woody weeds we need grass, because the woody weeds decrease the sunlight getting through—there is very little grass—and there is massive erosion occurring. Farmers are forced to not clear these woody weeds, which are known as little trees. Instead, we need to let the farmers manage the land. Sharon Lohse has been fighting this for 12 years. She has now become a candidate for One Nation at the state election. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">These property rights are fundamental, and the destruction of property rights is allied to red tape, green tape and blue tape, which are choking the farmers in our state. We need to get it back to grasslands—the original vegetation—remove farmers' restrictions and let them be competitive through their own innovation and scope for innovation. These people manage trucks, aircraft and all kinds of tools and equipment. It is just amazing what this small family does. Sheep graziers Nigel and Rosemary Brumpton cannot comply with the tree clearing guidelines, which are senseless. Nigel said to me, 'This land does not need to be subsidized,' and he makes a very good explanation of that.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">To finish, I want to say to people here in the Senate that these farmers are full of innovation, creativity and energy, and they are excited. <span style="font-style:italic;">(Time expired)</span></span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">
                  <a href="231199" type="MemberSpeech">
                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Senator URQUHART</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Tasmania</span>—<span class="HPS-MinisterialTitles">Opposition Whip in the Senate</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">20:46</span>):  Tonight I rise to share a story about the generosity of Australians and the warmth of our Pacific neighbours. The story starts when I was a delegate at the Pacific Women's Parliamentary Partnerships Forum in Suva, Fiji, in April 2015. At dinner on the first night I met the Deputy Mayor of Port Vila, Mrs Leimara Malachi. Leimara had been elected Deputy Mayor just a year earlier. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The forum was just a month after Cyclone Pam hit Vanuatu and the South Pacific—the most powerful cyclone to hit the region. Cyclone Pam killed at least fifteen people in Vanuatu, and decimated housing, agriculture, schools, hospitals and infrastructure. Councillor Leimara and I talked briefly about the destruction. I queried her particularly on the damage to schools, and Leimara responded that there had been terrible damage to schools. I asked further about the damage to books and resources that the students relied upon. Again, Leimara emotionally responded that the majority had all been ruined. At this point, I made a commitment that when I was back home in north-west Tasmania I would write to the schools in the region to ask if they would donate books and resources to Vanuatu schools. I received a strong response from schools across the region, both public and private. While a number had already donated, eight schools from the west coast to Latrobe committed to making contributions. I want to say thank you to: Devonport Christian School; East Ulverstone Primary School; Latrobe Primary School; Ridgley Primary School; Sacred Heart Catholic School, Ulverstone; St Patrick's Catholic School, Latrobe; Wilmot Primary School; and Zeehan Primary School. Each school's methods were different. At some, an individual teacher led the charge, while at others a group of student leaders set about collecting books, pencils, exercise books and other stationery to send over. By October, I had visited each school and collected around 60 archive boxes full of goods to send to Vanuatu. Virgin Australia had offered to fly the boxes from Tasmania to Brisbane free of charge and then on to Vanuatu at fifty per cent of the cost.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Unfortunately, by mid-November that year, when I had secured the boxes and catalogued it all, the flights had been suspended due to the state of the runway in Vanuatu. Luckily, at around the same time, I met a number of Ni-Vans who had come to Tasmania under the Pacific island Seasonal Worker Program and who were hoping to share the cost of a container to send much-needed furniture and other goods home to replace those damaged in the cyclone. It was just perfect. I personally paid for space in the container and, despite the delay, the books were on their way. The boxes arrived in Port Vila in August last year, and Councillor Leimara insisted that I must come to Vanuatu to assist her to distribute the books. So, in October last year I managed to squeeze in four days in Vanuatu, by self-funding my travel and associated costs.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">On my arrival in Port Vila, I was met by Councillor Leimara, Kathy Solomon from the Vanuatu Department of Women's Affairs, and a group of officials. Joining the welcoming party were relatives of the officials, who greeted me with shell necklaces, frangipani leis and beautiful welcome songs. I was also happy to see one of the seasonal workers, Dimitri, who had helped me with a lot of the sorting and lifting of the books while he was back in Tasmania. On the Sunday, I met with Dorosday Watson, the Director of the Department of Women's Affairs, who gave me an informative briefing on the department's plans to work with the Port Vila municipality to boost the political and economic empowerment of women. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Dorosday highlighted that, despite the country's political independence over 36 years ago, women's major roles are dictated by traditional customs that have not moved with the times. The pressure on women to take on the roles of child bearing and rearing, taking care of the family's domestic needs, attending to the garden and livestock, and other 'housewife' duties has been a perpetual hindrance for women to participate fully in the development of their country in politics, business and the community. Dorosday explained that, like women across the Pacific, Ni-Van women are a very vulnerable group and often considered second-class citizens. Critically, women are the major victims of rapid development yet continue to remain silent and accept issues as normal. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The department's plans with the council were developed from a five-day forum that brought together over 600 women from diverse backgrounds across Port Vila. The outcomes and activities proposed include: political empowerment relating to the 2018 Port Vila elections and 2020 Vanuatu elections; economic empowerment comprising business training, production of handicrafts, carving and garments; and capacity building, including specific education and support programs for young girls and single mothers. Dorosday noted that the forum was the first of its kind to bring together women from across the five wards of Port Vila to discuss their community's development on their terms. The participants also found hearing from the five women councillors a great learning experience and an eye-opener into political decision making in the country. The councillors were elected in 2014 under a temporary special measure to ensure each of the five wards was represented by at least one woman. The reforms were introduced across the country in time for that year's council elections. Two years on, it is interesting to learn from a Pacific Leadership Program study that the experience of regional councillors in Luganville province varied markedly from that of the women in Port Vila.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The one-size-fits-all approach worked in the capital, but the political context for women in rural areas is so different that much more work is needed to improve political education that equips women to think and act politically from the moment they are elected. In parliaments and assemblies across the world, political affiliation may be stronger than the desire to work as a part of a women's caucus, regardless of the abject disadvantage women face in a community. Addressing gender equality and the associated policy challenges are so important for our sisters in Vanuatu and across the Pacific, and for their wider communities. We need Australian aid to continue to provide funding and support for women's political and economic empowerment across the developing world.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">As I mentioned at the start of my speech, I met Councillor Leimara at the Pacific Women's Parliamentary Forum in Fiji. It was the third Pacific Women's event that I have been privileged to attend, after Cook Islands and Palau. I remain in contact with many female politicians and candidates from across the region. I ended the meeting that day energised and determined to continue to promote women's political participation in the Pacific in Australia and highlight tremendous initiatives such as the highly successful women's forum in Vila.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">On the Monday and Tuesday, and even the Wednesday morning before my flight, Councillor Leimara, Kathy and I visited 10 cyclone-affected schools across Port Vila. Each school was delivered a number of boxes of books and supplies. The students and teachers were extremely grateful to the people of Tasmania for their generous donations. At each school, I was treated to thankyou songs from the children and many traditional greetings. Of course, I did not coordinate the donations for any thanks, and often I felt more grateful for the generosity and warmth of the ni-Vans I was meeting—they were taking the time to sing, dance and greet an Australian politician at the same time as they were rebuilding their schools and their communities. However, it was a true blessing to be able to spend the time with the students and teachers, for whom a few boxes of books and supplies meant so much—new ideas, bright colours and new words, to help them learn English, to inspire their imaginations and to fill their days with more fun.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">A number of the teachers remarked that it was the first time someone from the Parliament of Australia had visited their school. As the people of Port Vila continue to rebuild after Cyclone Pam, it was an honour to visit and make a small contribution to their efforts. I believe that by building connections with our near neighbours, through learning about each other's cultures, language and traditions, and with strong, well-researched, targeted support both through the Australian aid program and through private donations, we will improve the lives of Pacific Islanders and, indeed, people right across the world. To the schools and students from across northwest Tasmania for your generous contributions, and to the people of Vanuatu for your warmth and hospitality, thank you all.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">

                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Senator DODSON</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Western Australia</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">20:55</span>):  I wish to speak on the Australian National Audit Office report on the Indigenous Advancement Strategy. We have now received the report from the ANAO on the government's administration of the Indigenous Advancement Strategy. The report prepared by the Audit Office is a sad and troubling catalogue of woe in the administration of Indigenous affairs. In September 2013, responsibility for the majority of Indigenous-specific programs, as well as some mainstream programs that were designed to address the persistent disadvantage afflicting Indigenous communities, was transferred into the Department of the Prime Minister and Cabinet. Some 27 programs with 150 administered items, activities and sub-activities from eight separate portfolio entities moved to the Department of the Prime Minister and Cabinet. We know now from this report that this was a grievous mistake by the previous Prime Minister, Mr Abbott.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">In 2014, the Indigenous Advancement Strategy was announced by the Australian government. The ANAO has reviewed this strategy at a cost of nearly $900,000. The 2014-15 budget papers show that the government said it would save $534.4 million over five years by rationalising these Indigenous programs, grants and activities. In this case rationalisation is another word for cost cutting, for centralising, for establishing a top-down approach. This approach has been driven from 1 National Circuit, but has disenfranchised the communities and organisations of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Australia.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The audit report points to the failure of attempts by the department to engage in partnerships at the regional level with Aboriginal organisations and communities. It points to a lack of information being given to services and organisations. Minutes were not even taken at some information meetings. The audit report shows conclusively that the department did not effectively implement the strategy. It was a rushed job; a botched job. Planning and design for the strategy was squeezed into a timeframe of seven weeks. As a direct result, the department did not implement key necessary steps in the process, such as consultation, risk management and, very importantly for this place, advice to ministers. I quote the report:</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">These are very serious failings for a program that promised to deliver change and efficiency by bringing together different programs into an integrated approach that in partnership with communities would deliver transformative change. It simply never happened, but many Aboriginal organisations and communities were damaged and it created havoc and distress for many of our people and our organisations </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The audit found that the department did write up a consultation strategy but did not fully implement the approach outlined in the strategy. This is an auditor's understanding from the complaints that Aboriginal organisations across the nation have made; but it is also complaints that have been made to myself, to Senator McCarthy and to Ms Burney in the other house. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The report found that in most instances the department negotiated agreements that were consistent with the minister's approval. However, it also found that there were limited assurances that negotiations were fair and transparent. The audit continued to find problems. It found that the department did not maintain sufficient records throughout the assessment and decision-making process, so it was simply not possible for the auditors to determine how the committee arrived at its funding recommendations. The department did not record compliance with probity requirements—that is, with the department's own probity rules. The department says that it is authorised to intervene and improve the governance of Aboriginal organisations. It seems they could learn some very key factors from the Aboriginal organisations themselves. Further, the audit found that the department did not maintain adequate records of ministerial approval of grant funding. The audit found that the list of recommended projects provided to the minister did not even give enough information to meet mandatory requirements of the Commonwealth Grants Rules and Guidelines.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">One can feel some sympathy for the minister. He was not given the information he needed to make decent decisions. Even when he made decisions, they were reversed by the department in many cases. The audit also observed that the department reallocated funding from projects approved by the minister. In one case, in 92 of these projects approved by the minister the department reallocated them without his consent. So the department made 92 projects, approving their funding. The department had a different view, because they simply reallocated the money. The minister, however, presided over all of this, so he cannot be let off the hook lightly. We will be asking further questions about these issues over coming weeks. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I would like to close by focusing on the broader strategic relationship issues between governments and our communities. This audit report highlights the quintessence of why there is no celebrated relationship between the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander peoples of this country and the nation state, especially this government.</span>

                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Senator O'NEILL</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">New South Wales</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">21:02</span>):  As young people return to school, I want to make some remarks about the nature of schooling, but before I turn to the major focus of my comments this evening I would also like to initially acknowledge the Ourimbah Hospital Auxiliary, who are one of the most hospitable groups that support our hospitals on the Central Coast. They do an amazing job.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">This organisation has been operating since 1946. I was very happy to attend their annual general meeting. It is a real joy for politicians from the Central Coast to be invited to this august group. One of the great things that they give us as we depart for the afternoon is some of the fruit that is grown in the local Ourimbah area.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">This is a group of wonderful women and community members, who have undertaken great work over all those years since 1946. They have had a stall outside Ourimbah Public School selling goods to raise funds for Gosford Hospital since that year. Other activities include social days, social bus trips and morning and afternoon teas. This is a community that is highly connected. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">During the past 15 years the group has raised more than $90,000, which has been spent on items such as oxygen monitors, vital sign monitors, treatment chairs, blood pressure monitors, pressure mattresses and an ECG machine. It is one of the smallest of the 204 auxiliaries operating in NSW, but one of the most dedicated. They punch well above their weight in terms of the impact they have in the local community. This tireless group of volunteers are remarkable people and a wonderful example of a community-based organisation that makes tangible differences to the lives of people in need. But we must never forget that this is a support to the basic responsibility of governments to provide for the health needs of our community. The community can support that, but the basic infrastructure to meet people's health needs must be met by our governments. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The group see their work as a privilege in building upon the previous seventy years, and I consider it a privilege to know them. I send my admiration, respect and best wishes together with the hope that the next seventy years of the group's work proves just as inspiring and successful in improving the lives of local people in the community.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">To the lives of people in the community one of the greatest investments we can make in our communities is education. The Labor Party absolutely understands that. Unfortunately, under this government the future for our schools, and therefore for our students, our community and indeed for our economy looks bleak.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Nationwide, the Liberals are intending to cut $30 billion from school funding. That is like sacking one in seven teachers. There is absolutely no doubt that this savage attack on the nation's future will damage our schools and the learning of our students, who are obliged by law to attend school for 13 years of their lives. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The Liberals' cuts mean that, on average, every single school in Australia will lose $3 million. That is a $3 million investment in our children, in their learning, in improving our teachers' professional development and in improving the opportunities for our young people to have the skills they need to meet the challenges of the 21st century. It will inevitably mean fewer teachers and less one-on-one attention for those needing additional learning support, and it will mean students will be left behind. It will mean students getting less help, with fewer resources to help them master the basics of learning: reading, writing, mathematics, science and computer skills. And that is to say nothing of the powerful soft skills that are often talked about at schools, the skills that make people great participants in the workforce when they leave school—through learning how to work in a group, through learning how to problem solve, through all the social skills that are acquired when good learning happens in our schools.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Yet again this government's policy on funding schools proves that in spite of all the promises, in spite of all the platitudes and rhetoric, you simply cannot trust them on education. The Turnbull government are cutting funding from schools at the same time—they were here in the parliament today, fighting to give a big business cut of $50 billion to the top end of town. They have made a choice, but they just have not made a choice for the nation's schools. Instead, as they always do, they have chosen in their policy settings to spend taxpayers' money on handouts to big business and the banks, while they can never seem to find the money to do the basic job of building the future of this nation; investing in our schools, investing in our learners, investing in the future of this country. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Nobody should be fooled by the argument the government is proposing that funding for schools is increasing in millions of dollars of years and that is meeting the need. The fact is that the number of students attending schools is increasing. It costs more to educate a larger number of students. People know in their own budgets that inflation has an impact, and the cost of educational inflation is higher than that of inflation in the general economy, so that costs more. </span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">The Labor Party has always believed and continues to believe that a high-quality education is a ticket to a lifetime of opportunity. A high-quality education is absolutely critical to ensure Australia has a strong economic base from which to secure jobs and create new jobs for a prosperous future. It was Labor that committed to a national needs based funding model for schools to lift equity and achievement, by supporting students, parents, teachers and principals to get on and do the real job of education. If we are to reach those goals, we have to be investing in education, not cutting funding. Raw numbers of dollars invested in education do not tell the truth about the proper investment that should be going into schools. </span>

                  </a>  Thank you, Mr Acting Deputy President. We know that we have hit a raw nerve, because they do not want people to be reminded that leading into the 2013 election they said they would match Labor's funding for education, dollar for dollar. That was the promise writ large on posters right around the country at every school where people were voting. They lied. And the minute they got into parliament in that 2014 budget, they attempted to cut funding from the Gonski model, from needs based funding for Australian students. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">It is blatantly obvious that this government refuses to treat education as a national priority. The outcome is their lack of vision for the future of this nation. I have heard those opposite say that needs based reform is too expensive. I have heard them say that we cannot afford it. I have heard them say that it is not working. But this is nonsense to any person who has a young student at school right now; because, although it has only been going for a couple of years, the impact of the proper investment in needs based education is transforming what teachers are able to do and the learning that is able to happen for our students in schools. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">When will this government come to understand the blindingly obvious, that rather than saying we cannot afford to invest significantly in education, the truth is we cannot afford not to invest. It is all very well for the Prime Minister to go on about Australia as an innovation nation—although, I do notice he has gone a bit quiet on that lately—when we spend less on schools per capita of the GDP than the OECD average: 18 per cent for primary compared to the OECD average of 22 per cent. We are below the average of our competitors. And they continue to tell lies about the amount of money that is being invested. It is 23 per cent for students in secondary school compared to the average OECD contribution of 25 per cent. That is way below the spending of some of our regional economic competitors. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">When Labor negotiated the Gonski needs based funding with states and territories, we did so with very clear targets in mind and a clear plan on how we were to get there. When the Liberals got elected, they threw this plan out. They said states could have Commonwealth funding with no strings attached. They did not even make sure the states kept investing in schools. So it is very, very rich of the Liberals to turn around now and say to the states, 'You need to reform your schools.' They threw out the extensive reforms that Labor argued were needed. And they are ignoring the reality that investing in schools—where the Gonski money has gone—is actually making a profound difference and improvement in students' learning. </span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">
                  <a href="00AOQ" type="MemberSpeech">
                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Senator MOORE</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Queensland</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">21:13</span>):  Last year in this place, over 50 parliamentarians from both the House of Representatives and the Senate signed a petition calling for fair treatment of Palestinian children in Israel. This was not just a campaign started by interested people in Australia; it was part of an international process which was calling for consideration and investigation of how young people—children under 18—are treated currently through the disputes in Israel. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The campaign was auspiced by the American Friends Service Committee, which of course are the Quakers, and an organisation called Defence for Children International, which is auspiced specifically by their Palestinian group, but this organisation is much wider and is looking generally at the issues around defence for children. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">As a result of the campaign, which is focused specifically at No Way to Treat a Child, in the US parliament 20 members of the US Congress wrote to the President urging the appointment of a special envoy for Palestinian children to ensure the US government prioritised Palestinian children's rights. And in the UK there have been a series of debates, the last one being in 2016, around issues of child prisoners and detainees in occupied Palestinian territories. This is focused most clearly on ensuring that questions are asked, that issues are raised and that, hopefully, together we will be able to look at whether the issues are real and whether there can be action into the future to ensure—most particularly amidst all the horrors of the ongoing violence and dispute within the Israel-Palestine area—that at least the world takes notice of the rights of children.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The data that was brought forward was not only in this campaign; over a number of years investigations have been held looking at how children are treated in the West Bank and Gaza. With this particular focus, we are looking at data which shows that, over the last couple of years, there has been a dramatic increase in the number of young people who have been held as a result of action or concerns about criminal activity in a militarised zone. The data is quite confronting, and it is important that people have a chance to see the kinds of allegations that have been made, looking indeed at young people. The findings, particularly from Defence for Children Palestine, look at a group of 429 children. That is not an extraordinarily large group, but these are in-depth discussions with young people who have survived the process of being detained. The report shows a disturbing pattern of practices used throughout the arrest, detention and prosecution of Palestinian children.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I will go through some of the findings. An overwhelming majority of Palestinian children arrested by Israeli forces had their hands tied and eyes blindfolded. During interrogation, 97 per cent of children did not have a lawyer or family member present. Forty per cent of the children were arrested from their homes in the middle of the night. In nearly 90 per cent of the cases parents were not informed of the reason for the arrest or the location of detention. Children have been taken from their homes—granted, homes that have not been secure, and children and families have been living in circumstances that no-one here can understand. Nonetheless, these children, who were in their home, their place of safety, were taken at night and their parents were not told where their children had been taken. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Upon arrest and during interrogation, 97 per cent of children were not properly informed of their rights, including the right to remain silent. Remember, this is an arrest process. These are rights that we take for granted, rights that are protected in the United Nations Convention on the Rights of the Child, and also through the general justice and jury process. From the data that has been brought forward by this particular organisation, the claim is that over 97 per cent of the children were not properly informed of, or did not know of, their rights in this process. The report goes on to say that a third of the children were shown or were forced to sign official documents in Hebrew. The implication of that statement is that these young children are Palestinian, and Hebrew is not a language with which they are familiar, or at least familiar enough to know exactly the circumstances in which they had been placed. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The report goes on to say that three-quarters of the young people experienced some form of physical violence. As documented, the elements of violence consist of 'being pushed, slapped, punched, kicked or struck with a soldier's helmet or gun'. Seventy-one per cent reported verbal abuse or intimidation and 70 per cent reported strip searching—and these are children being strip-searched by soldiers. Granted, many of the soldiers are quite young themselves, but they certainly are not children. Then 72 per cent were denied adequate food or water. The report documented that 66 children were held in solitary confinement for an average period of 13 days. A documented case from 2015 showed that Israeli authorities held Abdel-Fatah Ouri, who was 17 years old, in isolation for 45 days. The expectation, of course, is that the young people are taken and then accused of taking an action, and the hope from the authorities is that a confession can then be achieved and the process would follow on from there. The idea is to make sure that an allegation is followed by an interrogation so that, in cases where confessions are made, the justice system proceeds more quickly. If young people do not know their rights and do not know about what they are being charged with, there are questions about their understanding of the whole process.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Military Court Watch, which is on the internet, looks particularly at what happens in military courts around the world. It is led by an Australian lawyer called Gerard Horton, and he interviewed 71 children in 2016. Their report follows the patterns that I have described and that were indicated in the report from the Defence for Children International—the concerns about understanding the situation, being subjected to violence and then not understanding where the detainment will take place or when and if they will see their parents or understand their legal rights.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Furthermore, the UN Committee against Torture—which is again fully documented, and people can go to these websites and see it—also looked at the issues around young people in this particular conflict. A report in May last year reported that, while they recognise some policy changes have taken place, because these discussions have been going on for a long time, they are:</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Small">…concerned at reports that such legal developments are not always implemented in practice, in particular with respect to Palestinian minors accused of security-related offences. In this respect, it is concerned at allegations of many instances in which Palestinian minors were exposed to torture or ill-treatment, including to obtain confessions … The Committee is also concerned that many of these children, like many other Palestinians, are deprived of liberty in facilities located in Israel, thus hindering access to visits of relatives who live in the Occupied Palestinian Territory. The Committee is further concerned that at the time of the dialogue there were 12 minors in administrative detention and 207 Palestinian minors residents of the West Bank in detention for security-related offences.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The committee recommended in a direct recommendation of this process through to Israel that the Israeli government should work on:</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Small">(a) Ensuring that the deprivation of liberty of minors, irrespective of the charges brought against them, is a last resort, limited to the shortest possible period, and that it is reviewed daily with a view to eliminating it;</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Small">(b) Systematically ensuring that all minors deprived of liberty are afforded all the basic legal safeguards from the very outset of the deprivation of liberty; that they have a lawyer and/or a trusted adult present at every phase of the proceeding, including during interrogations; and that evidence obtained without observing these provisions are inadmissible in court;</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Small">(c) Preventing, investigating and adequately sanctioning practices involving torture or ill-treatment. It should also ensure that minors who were victims of torture or ill-treatment are afforded appropriate redress, including the means for as full rehabilitation as possible;</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">

                <span class="HPS-Normal">The kind of issues that I have just read out are the expectations of international jurists and of many people here who are knowledgeable on legal process and would be standard expectations of the treatment of young people who are caught up in a legal situation. We do understand—and there is no naivety in this situation, Mr Acting Deputy President—that we are talking about a warlike situation. People are fully aware that this is a security area and that there has been generations of violence in this place. Considering that, there still should be an understanding that when you are looking at the rights of young people there should be—and there are—international guidelines for how this treatment should be handled, for how the investigation should take place and for ensuring consistently that young people are safe and fully aware of their rights.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I just want to put on record one of the pieces of evidence that was made about one young man. Often, you can talk about the theory. But when you hear the statement made by this young person about his own treatment it brings it very close and makes it a much more real understanding. This relates to a young man called Waleed Lebdeh, who was arrested by Israeli soldiers on 17 March 2014—it is almost coming up three years. He was arrested around 8 pm after he was reported to have thrown a stone at a car near the Jewish only settlement, Ma'ale Shomron, near the West Bank village of Azzun. The armed guard at the entrance to the settlement saw Waleed and shouted at him to stay still. The guard radioed Israeli forces, which soon arrived, and Waleed was blindfolded and bound at the wrist with a single plastic cord. He was transported in a military vehicle to Ariel police station, located in Ariel settlement, arriving around 10 pm. Waleed was permitted to drink water and use the bathroom before interrogation, which proceeded without reading these rights to any legal guardian or counsel present. 'He interrogated me for about an hour,' Waleed said. 'He was shouting and pounding the table to intimidate me. I confessed to throwing one stone.' He signed a statement in Hebrew without knowing its contents. Although there was a translator in the room, the document was not translated. He was again blindfolded, bound and transferred to Huwwara Interrogation and Detention Center, where he was detained until 10 am the following morning. Subsequently, he was transferred to Megiddo prison in Israel, arriving around noon. There, he was stripsearched and detained in the juvenile section. He appeared before a judge on 19 March. On 20 March, Waleed pleaded guilty to throwing stones.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">There are a series of horrors that have occurred in the Israel-Palestine conflict. This is not a place where we are going to be able to solve all those issues. What we can do is ensure that there is an openness of discussion and, in some way, we are able to move forward.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">After the petition was signed in Australia, a number of the people who did sign that petition received letters from the Australia/Israel &amp; Jewish Affairs Council. I was really pleased to be able to receive this communication from the council. I respect many of the people who are involved in that group. I have met with them many times over the years. They have actually come up with a response to some of the allegations that were made in the petition. They do make the conclusion that nobody would say that the IDF's handling of Palestinian youth offenders is perfect or cannot be criticised. But the petition is not really about making things better. Or it would support cooperative efforts, like the IDF-UNICEF collaboration on the issue, and track and promote progress when it occurs rather than just ignore it. A number of specific statements were made about some of the allegations that I have read out in terms of treatment of young people.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">In particular, with the issue around the rights of children to have lawyers and them not being available for that process it is claimed that this is standard Israeli law—this is not a particular process for Palestinian children. The military prosecutor and the Israeli police clarified that the same regulations apply to Palestinian children in military detention as for Israeli children under Israeli law. Children have the right to consult with the lawyer but the lawyer does not have the right to be present during the interrogation. I think that is something that raises even more concerns for me in terms of the rights of all children under Israeli law. But at least there was some response. The AIJAC response also talks about the fact that with the issues raised by UNICEF in the past there have been attempts to work on that and to make them better. That is something we welcome. When issues are raised and it is acknowledged that things can be done better the idea is: that process is put in place, and we can then work together to make sure that things do become better.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I am really pleased that at least we will be able to have some dialogue on this process. The open statement and, indeed, all the things I have read into the record this afternoon from <span style="font-style:italic;">No Way to Treat a Child</span> are all on public record. Anyone can read this, get their own information and ask their own questions. The Australia/Israel &amp; Jewish Affairs Council's information is also openly available. I think it would be really useful if people who have concerns in this space have the chance to read all the information and further question and interrogate so that we can share an acknowledgement that our overall concern is about the safety and well-being of children.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">There is an ongoing process through the report of the Secretary-General on children and armed conflict. This is a process in which their report is given every year about the situation across the world in areas of conflict—not just in Israel and Palestine. So it is not focused just in this space. It is a very sad document to read—the 2016 report in this case—because it itemises concerns of Palestinian children being poorly treated by Israelis and, also, Israeli children who have been caught up in this confident, as well. It is just a series of data that looks at the number of young people being treated poorly. Fifty-four Palestinian children, 45 boys and nine girls, were involved in issues with Israeli settlers, with 20 cases of direct injury by settlers. A total of 13 Israeli children, nine boys and four girls, were injured by Palestinians. It goes through and lists this data.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We have information now available to all of us. It is there. It is not a matter of actually trying to allocate total fault or blame, because we have gone well beyond that in this process. What I want to highlight this evening is the particular concern about young people and how we as parliamentarians, not just in Australia but across the world, can be involved in a positive way to see whether we can work effectively to look at one element of this ongoing conflict. I think that that would be something that we would all agree on, no matter which way we feel about the original causes of the conflict and what the future will be. I do not think there is anyone who would not be seeking a way of ensuring that children are treated fairly and safely. The international conventions on the treatment of the child, the international conventions on effective jurisprudence and the international conventions on how people can be treated in conflict itself are all available to learn from. We can ensure that questions about the treatment of Waleed, his future, his detention and how he will be able to rebuild his life after the series of attacks that he suffered after an accusation that he threw one stone at a vehicle in a security space are answered. No-one can believe that that is the fair treatment of a child.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The petition that 51 parliamentarians signed here in the Australian parliament calls on the Israeli government to:</span>

                <span class="HPS-Small">… comply with its obligations under the Convention on the rights of the child and to not arrest or detain Palestinian children unless this is a last resort, and if they are detained, to immediately institute protections for those children including that their safety and best interests are prioritised, and that they are permitted a fair trial.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">New South Wales</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">21:32</span>):  The treatment of Palestinian children by the Israeli military, particularly the use of solitary confinement, is an issue of growing global concern. Senator Claire Moore tonight has made a most significant and informative speech on this matter. Another aspect of this abuse is that Palestinian children are being detained under appalling circumstances. Palestinians in the West Bank live under military law, while Israeli settlers live under Israeli civil law. Two people on one piece of land live under two different sets of laws, with the military laws granting people they impact on far fewer rights and safeguards.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Defence for Children International has collected testimonies of 429 Palestinian children who have experienced military detention. They found that 15 per cent of these children were held in solitary confinement for more than two days. They also found that the use of isolation by Israeli authorities does not appear to be related to any disciplinary, protective or medical rationale or justification. In fact, the evidence overwhelmingly suggests that it is used solely for interrogation purposes to obtain a confession. The UN special rapporteur on torture indicates that the imposition of solitary confinement of any duration on juveniles is cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment and violates article 7 of the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights and article 16 of the Convention against Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman or Degrading Treatment or Punishment and therefore should be completely banned. Israel has actually signed both of those treaties.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Palestinian children interviewed by Defence for Children International, however, were held in solitary confinement for an average of 13 days, with the longest reported as 45 days. Defence for Children International report:</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Small">The children taken to Kishon … detention center … inside Israel, describe being held in isolation in a small cell measuring approximately … (6.5 x 10 feet). The children report either sleeping on a concrete bed, on the floor, or on a thin mattress that is often described as "dirty" and "foul smelling." There are no windows and no natural light. The only source of light comes from a dim yellow bulb that is reportedly kept on at all hours. Meals are passed to children through a flap in the door. Cell walls are reported to be gray in color with sharp or rough protrusions that are painful to lean against.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The only clear reason that solitary confinement would be used for a child in the context of an interrogation is to lead to a confession, and, in 90 per cent of these cases gathered by Defence for Children International, it did.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Take the case of Abdullah, for example. Abdullah, 17 years of age, was held in solitary confinement for 26 days. He was arrested at 3 am in the morning in his own home. He was bound, blindfolded and transported to a military base in the Jewish only settlement where he was strip-searched and then later transported to the Al-Jalame interrogation and detention centre inside Israel. This is how Abdullah described what happened to him:</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Small">On the first day of my arrival to Al-Jalame, I was taken to an interrogation room to be interrogated … He accused me of throwing Molotov cocktails and stones. He interrogated me for two hours. He was shouting at me to intimidate me, but I did not confess.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Small">He shouted at me and threatened to beat me. Another interrogator came in, shouting at me and threatening, 'I'll smash your head if you don't confess. And if you don't talk from your mouth, I'll make you talk from your ass.' I was really scared of him.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The report goes on to say that over the course of 12 days, all in solitary confinement:</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Small">Abdullah was interrogated three separate times and confessed to throwing two Molotov cocktails during the third interrogation session. His detention was extended at least six times—</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">by military courts. The testimony references the use of intimidation and assault. The evidence is that the use of abuse, as well as informants posing as fellow prisoners, is common.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The most disturbing thing is that the trend to use solitary confinement, particularly for young people, appears to be increasing. The Israeli government must be held accountable to international norms in the way it interrogates and imprisons children and juveniles. It must take international advice and cease the use of solitary confinement for Palestinian children and juveniles. That is a really important step that needs to be taken.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">On another matter, among the growing number of reasons why the New South Wales Liberal-National government should be thrown out of office environmental destruction is a standout. There are many precious and unique environments in New South Wales, and tragically so many of them are being destroyed at an increasing rate. The destruction has serious consequences for all of us. This destruction is occurring because when the Liberal and National parties form government they use their power to deliver for corporate interests, and the top interest of business is to increase profits. That means that businesses push for environmental and labour laws to be weakened, and conservative governments comply. The business world knows this is the way they can save money and boost profits, and the losers are ordinary people and the environment.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Some try to argue that a concession to a miner or a developer means only a small environmental loss for the greater good. This is a distorted and dishonest argument that attempts to mislead the public. We must consider the cumulative damage as more and more environments are damaged and destroyed. While companies do make short-term profits, the economic loss in the long term will be huge. We all depend on our natural heritage—clean air, clean water and biodiversity. We ignore the loss of precious environmental spaces to our peril.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Here are some recent acts of destruction that have been perpetrated in the interests of private wealth by the Liberals and Nationals in New South Wales. The New South Wales government's controversial biodiversity laws have passed their final hurdle in parliament. Landowners in that state are set to get greater power to clear their land. The legislation will replace the Native Vegetation Act, which was designed to prevent mass land clearing. The amount of land in New South Wales being cleared for crops and pasture is accelerating, with almost two-thirds of the tally in 2012-13 officially referred to as 'unexplained', indicating that land-clearing regulations were not enforced. With the new legislation land clearing will certainly escalate further, leading to an increased loss of biodiversity and serious negative impacts on the climate. According to the Nature Conservation Council of New South Wales, thousands of possums, quolls, koalas and gliders will be killed in New South Wales each year.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We know that the whole of Australia prior to the New South Wales changes to the land-clearing rules has the shameful record of having the highest rate of species extinctions in the world. We also know that so many of these extinctions were driven by practices in New South Wales. Yes, most of these losses occurred before the election of the current Liberal-National government, but the policy of this current government is further driving this destruction. The changes will deliver short-term gains for big agribusinesses and developers and boost their profits, but the long-term loss for all of us is unacceptable. As well as adding to extinction pressures on thousands of New South Wales's threatened species, land clearing threatens our clean, reliable water supplies, turns fertile land into wastelands through erosion and salinity, puts bushland at risk and adds further to Australia's carbon pollution.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Another environmental threat in New South Wales is to the clean water resources in that state. West of Sydney, the Centennial Coal company's Springvale mine has been granted approval by the New South Wales Planning Assessment Commission to extend underground mining beneath the Newnes State Forest to extract 4.5 million tonnes of coal per year for a further 13 years. The discharge of large amounts of polluted water will flow into the river systems that feed into Sydney's major drinking water reservoir.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">In the north of the state, Santos coal seam gas wells in the Pilliga state forest are within the crucial southern recharge zone of the Great Artesian Basin. This is the only permanent inland groundwater source in Australia. The fracking process of the wells creates puncture holes through the protective clay layers thus permitting highly toxic produced water to seep into the artesian aquifers. Any damage is irreversible. Santos plan to drill 850 coal seam gas wells through the Pilliga forest, the largest inland forest left in eastern Australia. Santos's risky quest for coal seam gas in the Pilliga so far has met with disastrous results, with over 20 pollution scares, including groundwater contamination, waste spills and continuing leaks from evaporation ponds. Santos's plans have been met by fierce community opposition, and I do congratulate the groups involved. Ninety-six per cent of people now living across more than three million hectares of land in northwest New South Wales want to be gas field free. No-one gains except Santos, with increased profits, if their plans go ahead.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Greedy coalmines in the Hunter Valley are also having a disastrous impact on ground and surface water, increasing salinity and threatening agricultural land. The report by Hydrology and Risk Consulting was commissioned by the Lock the Gate Alliance. It found mines now cover 18 times the area they did in 1981 and in 2013 used 88.5 billion litres of Hunter water. This will grow to 133 billion litres a year if new and proposed mines are realised, coalmines' own entitlements to 143 billion litres of water along with more than half of the high-security licences which give holders preferential access during droughts. The mines are changing the flow of the Hunter river, having impacts on salinity and putting other water users in the valley at risk—all this to produce even higher record amounts of coal for export, boosting profits to huge multinational corporations, whilst seriously adding to the planet's carbon emissions.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Yes, some companies profit out of this enormously but overall the economy, as well as the environment, is damaged. This is occurring, as the Liberal-National government is actively working against the common good. Our collective wellbeing comes a very poor second to corporate profit under the way the Liberals and Nationals abuse the environment. The Murray Darling Basin Authority, with government backing, is drastically reducing the water that is available for the Macquarie marshes and the Gwydir wetlands. This habitat is vital for the wider ecology as we experience the negative consequences of climate change.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Forests have been declining in New South Wales since European settlement began. Today only nine per cent of the native forests that remain are protected as national parks or conservation areas. Much of our remaining forests are slated for logging as state forests. These state forests represent incredibly important wildlife habitats. Almost 1000 wildlife and plant species New South Wales are formally listed as being threatened with extinction. Koala populations in New South Wales have declined by at least 33 per cent in the last 20 years and, on current trends, koalas could be extinct in New South Wales by 2055. Imagine koalas extinct in our country! According to the National Parks Association of New South Wales, logging, development and planning, drought and climate change are all major threats to this iconic Australian marsupial.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Overlogging has severely reduced the age structure of forests. One consequence of this is loss of old growth trees with hollows that provide essential habitat for birds, reptiles and mammals. The only way stop the decimation of these precious environments is to end subsidised and unprofitable logging of our public state forests. Yet, the government is persisting with new rules that will allow even more intensive logging of these forests. These rules are being worked up in secret with the Forestry Corporation. Why the secrecy? To facilitate corporate profits and to make it harder for the public to learn about how governments change the rules to benefit their constituency—corporate interests.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Environmental destruction is not confined to country areas. The New South Wales government has been responsible for the destruction of thousands of mature trees in urban areas as part of its transport infrastructure program, including the Westconnex motorway and the Eastern Suburbs light rail. The destruction of hundreds of significant trees, including 100-year-old fig trees, is causing much distress. With proper planning we could have saved these trees and gained a light-rail system. Alternative options do exist but the famous Anzac Parade with its memorial guard of huge trees is being reduced to a barren moonscape.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Urban land-clearing rules under the guise of bushfire protection are also decimating Sydney trees. Fire experts agree that 10/50 urban land-clearing rule, which allows trees within 10 metres of a home to be cleared, is a bad policy. It is having a serious impact on the leafy parts of Sydney. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">One of our very special environments are coastal upland hanging swamps. They support a range of unique ecosystems that are under threat from longwall coalmining. The New South Wales government has approved the expansion of this form of mining in the Sydney and Illawarra catchment, despite not knowing the cumulative impacts this will have a water supplies. The Woronora sandstone plateau above Wollongong is the site of much of this destruction. These swamps provide crucial water-filtering services that keep most streams and rivers in relatively good health. They are a vital part of the water catchment system. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The future of swamps is an issue of controversy. Mining companies in the Wollongong region are engaging in extreme environmental destruction. The Planning Assessment Commission has voiced concern that damage to the swamps is irreversible and irreparable. Environmental offset policies, brought in by the Liberal, National and Labor parties voting together, allow developers in particular mining companies to damage environmentally sensitive areas in one location if they agree to conserve areas elsewhere. This is a scam that governments have come up with to make out that they care for the environment, when the actual outcome is bulldozing and mining unique environments. When there is no land to swap companies may be offered the option to provide a cash payment to government coffers. The end result is that the mining companies are legally entitled to destroy endangered ecosystems.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The growing environmental threats in New South Wales only add to the list of severely endangered species—birds, reptiles, frogs, mammals. One by one our precious environments are falling prey to short-sighted policy decisions that favour mining and commercial developments over our natural environment and our wellbeing, even in the face of massive community objections. What is happening in New South Wales is a tragedy. Once lost these species, the environments that support them are gone forever. I congratulate the many local groups, environmental activists and nature and national park groups who are working so hard to save our environment. It is essential that we strengthen our environmental laws. Corporate power should not be allowed to wreck our environment.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Tasmania</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">21:50</span>):  I rise to make my contribution to the Senate about my time as a parliamentary adviser to the 71st General Assembly of the United Nations in New York from September to December last year. At the outset I would like to thank the Australian Senate for providing me with this opportunity to observe the work of the United Nations over such as significant period of time—and time obviously away from this place.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The delegation, consisting of myself and Senator Bernardi, was located at the Australian Mission to the United Nations in the Wells Fargo building on 42nd Street in New York City, about a 15-minute walk from the UN building. Firstly, I would like to thank the Australian Ambassador to the United Nations, Ms Gillian Bird, and all of the staff in the Australian mission for their professional advice and support during the 71st General Assembly. I particularly want to thank the second secretary, Julian Simpson, for his support and assistance throughout my visit. Australia, I think, can be very proud of the quality and dedication of our diplomatic staff and their hard work at this most important world institution. I would also like to thank my federal Labor Party caucus colleagues for choosing to me for this unique opportunity to represent Australia at the United Nations.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I also benefitted greatly from meeting many individuals from non-government organisations, think tanks and universities who welcomed me during my time at the United Nations and gave me an opportunity to learn new approaches to a range of issues facing both our nations, and indeed many nations across the globe. I also would like to thank the staff at the Australian Embassy in Washington DC for facilitating meetings on key policy areas of interest and arranging meetings. I enjoyed meeting with congressmen and being at Capitol Hill at such a critical time in the US political cycle.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I would like to give some observations of the United Nations as a global organisation and then discuss my observations and participation. Prior to leaving for this three-month delegation experience at the UN, I had been a member of the Australian parliament's Joint Standing Committee for Foreign Affairs, Defence and Trade. I had participated in a number of inquiries including Australia's advocacy against the death penalty, the empowerment of women and girls in the Indo-Pacific region, as well as previously serving as a member of the Australian parliament's Joint Standing committee on Treaties. Before my time in parliament I had also served as President of the United Nations Association Tasmanian Branch so to be able to put my understanding of the UN and its norms, structures, funds and programs into a real-life observation and participation was very exciting.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">During the first week in September, leaders of 193 countries merged in New York for the opening of the UN General Assembly. I welcomed the opportunity to participate in several official events arranged by the mission in association with the visit of the Minister for Foreign Affairs and the Prime Minister.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I appreciated the opportunity to give a statement on behalf of Australia to the UN's Second Committee on achieving the Sustainable Development Goals, and importantly marking the Paris Agreement coming into force, underscoring our collective resolve to confront the challenge of climate change. I appreciated further General Assembly statements I gave in Third committee and in Sixth Committee on Women's Empowerment and Transboundary Harm. And unlike the behaviour in the Australian parliament, everyone listened politely. The Australian parliament could learn something about how to behave from the UN General Assembly!</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">There are clearly limits to what the UN can accomplish. Trying to achieve consensus across 193 countries with their range of national interests is indeed a major hurdle. But the recent adoption of the 2030 Sustainable Agenda shows that it is still possible to achieve multilateral outcomes.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">Further, the structural fixture of the UN Security Council, with its five countries with veto powers, set after World War II, makes consensus even more challenging. Progress can be stalled or blocked by any one of those five, which I witnessed numerous times regarding the conflict in Syria. Yet throughout my three months involvement at the UN I became firmly of the view that for Australia to advance our own interests and regional interests, it was important we were part of the decision-making process of setting international norms, standards and mechanisms and then adhering to them.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I certainly learnt of the hard work, skilled negotiation and bridge building of diplomats. The effort to find common ground with one another rather than create conflict was impressive. So too was the good natured and professional approach of diplomats in trying to reach consensus. But of course the UN is not perfect, marked by its inability to deal with the myriad of issues in the Middle East, particularly Syria. Also it is a 70-year- old organisation and in some areas is very siloed. That is where it is important the new Secretary-General, Antonio Gutuerres, takes a lead to take on much needed reforms at the UN.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">It was an exciting time to be at the UN with the appointment of a new Secretary-General, something that usually only happens every 10 years. I had the opportunity to witness the informal talks and meetings where candidates for the Secretary-General position spoke to the member states on their vision and their candidature. I was impressed with the transparency and openness of the selection process and the number of candidates including a number of female candidates.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">On 13 October 2016, Antonio Guterres was appointed, with the endorsement of the UN Security Council, by the UN General Assembly to be the 9th UN Secretary-General. Mr Guterres' time as the Commissioner of the UNHCR included the largest movement of people seeking asylum since the end of the World War II. This makes him very qualified to deal with the challenges ahead in the movement of people and issues for people seeking refuge. Also when he was Prime Minister of Portugal, Mr Guterres helped lead the campaign for international intervention to stop the violence in East Timor following the vote for Timorese independence.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I had the privilege to meet the outgoing UN Secretary-General, Ban Ki-moon, whose 10-year tenure ended in December. He leaves a legacy as the UN Secretary-General that brought in the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development, led key human rights initiatives and directed the historic Paris Agreement on Climate Change and ratified it in record time.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">One of the biggest highlights for me was the UN Refugee Summit on 19 September 2016. It was a high-level plenary meeting addressing the large movements of refugees and migrants with an aim of bringing countries together behind a more humane and coordinated approach. Importantly it was the first time the General Assembly had called for a summit at the heads of government level on the large movements of refugees and migrants since the Refugee Convention was adopted in 1951. It was indeed a watershed moment in history. Member states, including Australia, reached agreement by consensus on a powerful 'outcome document' known as the New York Declaration outlining the political will of world leaders to save lives, protect rights and share responsibility on a global scale. Importantly, it commits member states to negotiate 'a comprehensive refugee response framework' and, separately, a 'global compact' for safe, orderly and regular migration, for adoption in 2018. The world faces a difficult political and social environment on migration. Current systems are failing, and with only 8 nations currently taking in 86 per cent of the world's refugees, more must be done to encourage and support other nations to accept displaced people. The commitments made are bold, but I look forward to them, hopefully, shaping a more compassionate and effective migration policy across the globe, and indeed to Australia playing its part.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I participated in a number of high-level side events that provided insight into the different strategies countries are adopting towards refugees and migrants. I learnt about Canada's remarkable national project to settle 25,000 Syrian refugees in just four months. They made the refugee situation a whole-of-society approach, not just the responsibility of government. Trade unions, churches, NGOs, universities and businesses all expressed a desire to do something. A strong theme was also the importance of giving dignity and the full potential to live a better life through ensuring refugees can become more self-reliant and able to take their lives into their own hands. To achieve this, there need to be better partnerships between government, humanitarian actors and private enterprise. The UNHCR highlighted that refugees are people with remarkable skills, and, if we provide the enabling environment, positive change can happen. If refugees are allowed to work and move, they can be contributing people in host countries and become key contributors to their economies. But, most importantly, the UN Secretary-General ended the session by highlighting that there should be no politics when it comes to human life. I could not agree more.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The UN Security Council met on numerous occasions at various times of the day and night throughout my three months at the UN. Whilst the main aim of the council was to pass resolutions for a ceasefire in Aleppo, Russia continually used its veto power to block such an outcome, and has been accused of barbarism and committing war crimes. This is one of the worst conflicts seen this decade. It is a complete affront to humanity. The attacks on the civilian population of Aleppo are an appalling humanitarian disaster and a complete breach of international law. France drafted a UN Security Council resolution to impose a ceasefire on Aleppo, which would have meant a new US and Russia truce, the grounding of Syrian air strikes, and a pause in military fighting in Aleppo. That would then have allowed the aid convoys to have, hopefully, made it back into Aleppo. However, on the night of Saturday, 8 October last year, Russia used its veto power to vote down that resolution. It was the fifth time Russia had used its veto against a UN resolution on Syria during the more-than-five-year conflict.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I also attended a number of important briefings in the UN Security Council about the concerning situation in South Sudan. The horrific nature of this tribal war has resulted in a mass displacement of now one million refugees fleeing the country, and 4.8 million people are facing severe food insecurity. The panel report outlined the relentless obstruction and attacks against UN and humanitarian missions, and the grave outcome of the killing of 67 aid workers since the outbreak of conflict in December 2013. The most confronting was the report of conflict-related sexual violence and the ongoing killings of civilians, women, children and the elderly. The permanent ceasefire has not been respected by the parties since July, and there was mention of the need for the Security Council to impose an arms embargo in order to prevent further destabilisation of the security situation and the major human rights violations.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">My time at the UN covered a diverse range of issues, perhaps more than I can go through this evening, but they did include human rights, gender equality and women's reproductive rights, the rights of children, nuclear disarmament, and indigenous and refugee issues. I was pleased to sit in on a statement delivered in the third committee by the very impressive Australian Youth Representative to the UN, Chris Eigeland, who gave an impressive and strong message about the importance of inclusion of all people and the need to mobilise young people around the world in order to achieve the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I met with Australia's Ambassador for Women and Girls, Natasha Stott-Despoja, to discuss the challenges of gender equality, particularly in the Asia-Pacific. I also met with Princess Mary of Denmark about women's health initiatives, following her contribution made at the UN on the access of women and girls to reproductive health as part of the Safe Birth Even Here campaign. I also met with a number of women from neighbouring Pacific Island nations, including Fiji, Papua New Guinea, Samoa and New Zealand, to discuss some of the challenges we and our neighbours face together.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The Permanent Missions of Brazil and Guatemala to the United Nations, along with ICAN, the International Campaign to Abolish Nuclear Weapons, invited me to speak at a UN side event on the negotiations for a legally binding instrument to ban nuclear weapons, as put forward by the open-ended working group. This was a critical issue facing the UN in October, resulting in the UN General Assembly adopting a landmark resolution to convene a conference in 2017. Australia, unfortunately and surprisingly, voted against the resolution, even though the resolution is regarded as an end to two decades of paralysis in multilateral nuclear disarmament efforts.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I also participated in the highest level meeting to ever take place in the UN to protect LGBTI people. The LGBT Core Group is a cross-regional group, including 19 countries as well as the Office of the UN High Commissioner for Human Rights, the European Union and Human Rights Watch, and included US Vice-President Joe Biden, Prime Minister Ms Erna Solberg of Norway and UN Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">There are still 70 countries where it is a crime for LGBTI people to live openly. They are being killed just for being who they are. Vice-President Biden spoke passionately on the human rights of LGBTI people across the globe and reflected on the recent Orlando nightclub shooting, which was the first time the UN Security Council, in condemning the violence, used language recognising violence targeting the LGBTI community.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I also had a range of meetings at the UN Secretariat building, including briefings from the UN Office of Disarmament and the UN Department of Safety and Security's Under-Secretary-General Peter Drennan, a former Australian official. I also met with key officials in UNICEF to discuss children's rights and the incredible work and operations of UNICEF. Equally, I met with key officials of UNFPA, the UN Population Fund, on their work to deliver stronger health systems for women's and girls' access to reproductive health, safe childbirth ad family planning.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Whilst I was at the mission, Australia's campaign and bid for a seat on the UN Human Rights Council was underway—the first time we have sought a seat on the Human Rights Council. My view is that, whilst I am not against our bid, I do see it as an opportunity for Australia to improve our record on human rights for Australia's First Peoples and for the treatment of asylum seekers and refugees. There is a lot more work to do this year for Australia to be confident of our election to the council, but I do wish the Australian mission all the best in its bid for that seat.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Of course, I was also in New York at a pivotal time in the US election cycle. A lot of people I met with were concerned that the work, deliberations and resolutions passed at the UN would be under threat with a change of administration. I am really not sure what direction a Trump administration will take towards the United Nations, but I do hope that President Trump recognises the importance of the United Nations in terms of an international rules based order. Despite the challenges the UN faces, the fact that all the nations of the world are sitting down and talking to each other, rather than killing each other, to try to resolve the world's most pressing issues is indeed a critical step for humanity.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">It was indeed a privilege to work at the United Nations. I look forward to utilising this special opportunity to promote understanding of the benefits of an international rules based institution which I believe is so fundamental to achieving peace and security, human rights and equality for all people.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Western Australia</span>—<span class="HPS-MinisterialTitles">Co-Deputy Leader of the Australian Greens</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">22:10</span>):  Since the fateful months of the Second World War, when Prime Minister Curtin stood up to Churchill and withdrew Australian forces from Europe so that they could fight in the Pacific theatre, the compass needle of Australian foreign policy has shifted sharply from the diminished glory of imperial Britain to the expanding global reach of the United States. Without thinking too hard about what it would look like if we ever called it in, we sheltered ourselves under the US nuclear weapons umbrella, endorsing a doctrine which has held since the 1950s that the only way to guarantee security is to threaten global incineration.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">During the cold war, we followed the United States into the slaughter in Vietnam, Laos and Cambodia in the name of domino theory and the containment of the communist menace. In the 1990s and early 2000s Australia provided diplomatic and military support to the US in Kuwait and Afghanistan. Most consequentially, Prime Minister Howard wrote a blank cheque to George W Bush in the illegal 2003 invasion of Iraq, which tore the region open and set the stage for the emergence of Islamic State. To this day Australia hosts intelligence and targeting facilities at Pine Gap, North West Cape and elsewhere. We host US Air Force and Marine Corps bases in the Northern Territory. We host port visits by nuclear powered and potentially nuclear armed warships. These are not just training facilities; they are places from which the US can project lethal force into our region.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We are one of the unblinking electronic eyes of the Five Eyes mass surveillance driftnet, helping the United States government hack commercial phone and internet providers in Indonesia and Malaysia and throughout South-East Asia. We routinely play diplomatic lapdog for the US government at the United Nations. In practice, that means that we undermine arms control treaties, nuclear weapons resolutions and attempts to de-escalate the horrific and one-sided conflict between Israel and the people of Palestine. We buy their F35 Joint Strike Fighter aircraft—the ones that cannot go anywhere near a conflict because they are a $1½ trillion piece of flying garbage. We let Australian citizen Julian Assange and his courageous colleagues hang out to dry for disclosing war crimes in Iraq and more conventional crimes revealed in the state department cables. When the United States government says jump, then, if we are lucky, our Intelligence and Security Committee will do a rapid bipartisan inquiry into how high. But inevitably, we jump.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">You would have thought that, as an opinionless, impressionable and largely obedient client state, Australian governments had more or less proved their credentials. Australia's foreign policy and its defence policy is set in Washington DC, not in Canberra. That was true under the Howard government, it was true under the Rudd-Gillard governments, it was nauseatingly evident under the Abbott government and it is painfully on show now.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Donald J Trump inherited President Obama's drone assassination program, his global mass surveillance apparatus, his Asia-Pacific Pivot that cemented the encirclement of China with a network of military bases in Australia, the Philippines, South Korea and Japan. Mr Trump inherited Obama's unprecedented attacks on whistleblowers and journalists. Maybe that all seemed benign when the argument was being run by a gifted orator like Mr Obama, but it was not benign.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">This is how NSA whistleblower Ed Snowden put it in a June 2013 interview in a hotel room in Hong Kong:</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Small">… the months ahead, the years ahead it's only going to get worse until eventually there will be a time where policies will change because the only thing that restricts the activities of the surveillance state are policy. Even our agreements with other sovereign governments, we consider that to be a stipulation of policy rather than a stipulation of law. And because of that a new leader will be elected, they'll find the switch, say that 'Because of the crisis, because of the dangers we face in the world, some new and unpredicted threat, we need more authority, we need more power.' And there will be nothing the people can do at that point to oppose it. And it will be turnkey tyranny.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Turnkey tyranny: the tools are all there; all it requires is an administration paranoid enough, arrogant enough, deranged enough to turn the key. A register of Muslims. Promotion of the intelligence value of torture. Overwhelming contempt for the journalists and news organisations who are tasked to hold him to account. Casual hostility to the rule of law: 'The opinion of this so-called judge, which essentially takes law enforcement away from our country, is ridiculous and will be overturned!' tweets the President of the United States of America.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Like most people, I was intrigued to hear the reports of the total contempt with which Australia was treated by President Donald Trump last week. The incoming President probably could not point to Australia on a map. On two consecutive days, the Trump administration's press secretary could not even be bothered to get our Prime Minister's name right. These are the kinds of things that could be easily given away as superficial breaches of protocol by an inexperienced administration. But they are not. Something much more malignant is underway here.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">It has been said, over and over again, that the foundation of our bond with the United States is our shared values. The deal that the US President wants to renege on is not some obscure negotiation over tariffs. It is about the life and death of 1,250 vulnerable and innocent human beings whose only crime was to flee violence and oppression in places like Iran, Sri Lanka, Afghanistan and Iraq. They are on the run from horrors that I hope no-one in this chamber ever has to experience firsthand. Some of them are on the run from wars that Australia and the United States helped start. Some of them are fleeing authoritarian regimes supported or armed by Australia and the US and its allies. They had the savage misfortune to flee into the barbed wire embrace of Minister Peter Dutton's Australian Border Force. Since then, more people have died on the prison islands run and paid for by the Australian government on Nauru and Manus Island than have been given safe harbour and resettled. People have been beaten to death, died of easily treatable infections and burned themselves to death. People are starving themselves and drinking drain cleaner just to make the suffering stop. Right now, a Kuwaiti woman 35 weeks pregnant and suffering serious complications is at risk because the government had to be pressured by a public campaign to airlift her to Australia. An award-winning Iranian cartoonist who publishes as Eaten Fish is about to die of a hunger strike on Manus Island. He says: 'I cannot suffer anymore. I know now that I will have to die because I cannot suffer anymore.' These are not the shared values of the people of the United States and Australia. They are an expression of mutually assured inhumanity, a systematic hollowing out of empathy perpetrated by governments practising a form of political sociopathy.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">All of us in here want to know what Mr Donald Trump will demand of Mr Turnbull in exchange for his 'extreme vetting' of these desperate people. It seems obvious that the Australian government's degrading silence in the face of Mr Trump's Muslim ban is part of the price. Other world leaders were quick to condemn this act of indiscriminate racism. Nothing from Prime Minister Turnbull. Everyone has their price, I guess. As it turns out, Mr Turnbull's was very low.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Mr Trump appears to take an amoral and purely transactional view of international relations, just as he does in his business dealings. We know he has no respect for the weak, as evidenced by his weird crush on Vlad Putin. Pandering to or attempting to appease such an individual is pointless. He is likely completely unaware of the storied history of our two countries, or of the Australians who bled and died chasing his predecessors' imperial follies in South East Asia and the Middle East. He could not care less. If this were game theory and we were playing the prisoner's dilemma game with Donald J Trump in the adjacent cell, at least we would know he will always sell us out—every time. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">But this is not game theory. This is deadly serious. This fragile narcissist has the launch codes for just under 1,800 deployed nuclear weapons, any one of which could turn a city into radioactive ash within half an hour of the command being given. Obviously, 1,800 of these genocidal weapons were not enough, because he then announced a new nuclear weapons arms race on Twitter. The <span style="font-style:italic;">Bulletin of the Atomic Scientists</span> then moved the hands of the doomsday clock to two minutes and 30 seconds to midnight. The last time we were here was 1953. Midnight, in this context, signifies a nuclear exchange in which millions or perhaps hundreds of millions of people lose their lives and we slide into a radioactive dark age. The violence wielded by this administration need not reach this apocalyptic scale. </span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">During the election campaign, Donald Trump promised to bring back waterboarding and other torture techniques. Since becoming President, he has said that torture 'absolutely works' and that the US needs to 'fight fire with fire'. There are claims that maybe the US should go back into Iraq and take the oil; executive orders setting in motion the re-establishment of CIA black prisons around the world; and the calculated and deliberate provocation of race hate and religious extremism. This is fascism in larval form. Fascism is not a word we should ever throw around lightly, particularly as its definition is so contested. But try this: Robert Paxton, Professor Emeritus at Columbia University, describes fascism as a dynamic process rather than a fixed ideology like socialism or communism. See if this paraphrasing of his work by Dominic Green in <span style="font-style:italic;">The Atlantic</span> of December last year sounds familiar:</span>

                <span class="HPS-Small">1.   Ideological formation and the creation of a party with quasi-military cadres. Talk of national humiliation, lost vigour, and the failures of liberalism and democracy.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Small">2.   Entry of the party into national politics. Intimidation of rivals, and planned acts of 'redemptive violence' against suspect minorities and radical rivals.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">Does any of that sound familiar? I am sure some of the people who voted for this administration would have happily signed on to this prescription. But I deeply believe that millions more simply wanted to put a brick through the window of the corrupt Washington establishment—that parasitic network of bankers, arms dealers, oil companies and media oligarchs who have been consuming the American republic from within for decades. It is these people—those voters—who are now in the process of being fundamentally betrayed by the extremists who wield executive power. The swamp is not being drained, friends—the swamp is being weaponised.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I have been to the US a couple of times, and I absolutely adore the place. Maybe, apart from India, I have never been anywhere more diverse and surprising. There is a bond of affection between the Australian people and those of the United States that is way deeper than the shared suffering and sacrifice that cemented the alliance during the global war on fascism in the1930s and 1940s. We feel like family, for better and for worse. We have similar colonial origins, our great grandparents arriving from Old Europa to wreak violence and disease on first nations peoples. From white supremacist underpinnings, we both attempted to build multicultural societies in the aftermath of that dispossession, to carve prosperity out of an unfamiliar continent, and through many decades of struggle to make important contributions to the practice of democracy and the rule of a certain kind of law. All cynicism aside, I agree with those from right across the political spectrum who have argued that the bond between the people of Australia and the people of the United States is strong and will endure beyond whoever happens to occupy the White House and the ministerial wing of this parliament.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The institutions of democracy and the rule of law may be stressed and under sustained attack, but they were built on shared sacrifice and it is essential that they be buttressed and protected. That looks like the Speaker of the UK House of Commons declaring that Donald Trump is unfit to address Westminster. It looks like millions of people joining the Women's March on Washington, that ended up mobilising more than five million people around the world and culminated in the largest single-day demonstration in the history of the United States. It looks like people who shut down airports across the United States when the full scope of Trump's Muslim ban became apparent. It looks like the taxi drivers in New York City who powerfully amplified this blockade with distributed industrial action. Here at home, it looks like the immediate renegotiation of the Australia-US alliance, with everything on the table—Pine Gap, 'Five Eyes', the US bases in the Top End. It is time to make our own way.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Donald Trump is a product of the United States, but he is everyone's problem. History, what there is left of it to write, will not look kindly on those who tried to appease this thing, or normalise it in the financial press, or did as our Attorney-General did today, trying to pretend that this is just a minor acceleration of business as usual. This is not a time to cave in. This is a time to stand up, not in order to return to the deadening neo-liberal status quo but to remind ourselves that another world is possible. This is a time to resist.</span>

This new economy is powered by skilled and educated Australians working in rewarding and well-paying jobs. Public support for the key components of the innovation system—including education, science and research, market frameworks, and infrastructure—has proven historically vital for economic growth throughout the most successful industrialised countries. To secure Australia's future economic prosperity, a serious, long term approach to catalysing and supporting innovation is required.</span>

It recognises that innovation is a major driving force for productivity, growth and jobs. The NISA sets out the Government's vision for Australia's innovation, research and science ecosystem. It is designed to spur innovation and entrepreneurship, enhance cutting edge national research infrastructure, address barriers to success and enable Australia to seize the opportunities afforded by innovation. The NISA will help to build internationally competitive and sustainable businesses, extract greater commercial value from our strong research outputs, increase our productivity and afford Australians high skilled employment opportunities. The Government will continue to advance the innovation agenda by increasing efforts and pursuing new opportunities under future NISA activities.</span>

                </span>The Committee recommends the establishment of an independent government agency with a mandate to administer and coordinate innovation system policies and programs. Such a body would be responsible for maintaining a continuous and consistent approach to innovation policy across the whole of government.</span>

              <span class="HPS-Small">Innovation ecosystems are inherently complex and require a flexible approach to ensure new opportunities and challenges can be acted on. In order for these systems to perform effectively to deliver increased productivity and competitiveness, governments must develop consistent and stable policies for innovation. Stability does not mean innovation initiatives ought not to be subject to review or improvement. Innovation policies need to be multifaceted, adaptive and address the entire innovation cycle to achieve genuine change at a national level. They also need to be aligned with a long term strategic framework, evaluated against comprehensive and quantifiable social and economic targets, and delivered transparently and efficiently.</span>

              <span class="HPS-Small">This policy approach will be achieved through the implementation of the NISA and the establishment of a new independent body, ISA, which will be responsible for advising the Government on all science, research and innovation matters. ISA complements the Commonwealth Science Council, which will continue to advise Government on high level science challenges facing Australia. ISA will be supported by a CEO accountable through the Minister for Industry, Innovation and Science to the new Innovation and Science Committee of Cabinet, chaired by the Prime Minister. This committee, supported by ISA, will ensure a consistent and whole‑of‑Government approach to innovation and science policy.</span>

              <span class="HPS-Small">The Government notes the Committee's recommendation regarding a 3% target for R&amp;D relates to combined public and private investment. It is important that Australia has effective policies which drive new private expenditure on R&amp;D and create a supportive environment to encourage industry to lead the way on R&amp;D expenditure, for the benefit of both industry and the broader economy. This is being achieved through measures under the NISA supporting new investment and capital formation in innovative businesses, for example:</span>

The Government has established five 'landing pads' (in San Francisco, Tel Aviv, Shanghai, Berlin and Singapore) to support entrepreneurial Australians and market-ready startups by providing an operational physical space to access the talent, mentors, investors and a wider connected network of innovation hubs in those locations.</span>

              <span class="HPS-Small">Ensuring the public investment in innovation is supported by a framework to encourage complementary long-term investment by Australia's private sector is a key priority of this Government. The ISA 2030 Strategic Plan will identify investment, infrastructure priorities and areas for consideration by the Government in order to ensure Australia is positioned to secure its future economic prosperity.</span>

                <span style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Recommendation 4:</span>
                <span style="font-style:italic;">
                </span>The Committee recommends that the Australian Government, working in collaboration with State and Territory governments, adopt a range of measures to support the role of local and regional innovation ecosystems.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
              <span class="HPS-Small">The Government agrees with this recommendation. The Government has a vital role in ensuring that the new jobs and other gains that flow from innovative new technologies and business models are shared across Australia. Creating a strong national innovation ecosystem is only possible with well-developed and supported regional ecosystems, particularly for areas of Australia built on traditional industries undergoing technological and globalised disruption.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Several of the NISA measures are of broad application and support the role of local and regional innovation ecosystems. For example, many of the measures listed above will help businesses and entrepreneurs attract investment and launch knowledge-based businesses to reach global markets from anywhere in Australia. In addition, the Government is investing $23 million through the Incubator Support initiative to support building local and regional innovation ecosystems. It will help grow the next generation of innovative businesses by offering matched funding to: support the development of new incubators in regional or sectoral areas with high innovation potential; boost the effectiveness of incubators, including support to expand their services and engage a Commercialisation Adviser; and provide access to top quality research and technical talent through secondments of national or international experts.</span>

            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Additionally, the Commonwealth and State and Territory governments are already progressing a number of measures to support local and regional innovation systems. The Commonwealth, State and Territory Advisory Council on Innovation (CSTACI), which comprises officials from the Commonwealth, State and Territory governments, and the New Zealand Government, aims to improve the effectiveness, integration and coordination of the national innovation system. They provide advice to all governments on their innovation policies, activities and programs.</span>

                <span style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Recommendation 5:</span> The committee recommends that the education system be accorded a central focus in the Australian Government's long-term innovation strategy, thereby acknowledging the central importance of the interplay between the STEM subjects and the humanities, social sciences and creative industries.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
              <span class="HPS-Small">The Government agrees with this recommendation. It is crucial that Australia nurtures and taps into the entire pool of science, technology, engineering and mathematics (STEM) and entrepreneurship talent in our population, while acknowledging the important role of humanities arts, and social sciences, to support a more innovative, inclusive and prosperous economy. This includes improving women's STEM workforce participation and economic independence. The development of creative capacities across the workforce and in society more broadly will be vital for the generation and successful commercialisation and uptake of new ideas.</span>

            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
              <span class="HPS-Small">As part of the NISA, the Government is investing $48 million to inspire all Australians, from pre-schoolers to the broader community, to engage with STEM and participate in further study. The Government is also investing $51 million to help Australian students to embrace the digital age and better prepare for the jobs of the future. Online computing challenges, ICT summer schools, competitions and support for teachers and school leaders will lead to improved STEM literacy. In addition, the Government is investing $13 million to encourage more girls and women to embark on and remain in STEM-related careers within science and research institutions, as well as STEM-based and entrepreneurial industries.</span>

              <span class="HPS-Small">Income inequality is a highly complex and increasingly contested area of the policy debate across much of the developed world. In discussing this issue, it is important to consider the appropriate role for governments in both alleviating poverty and reducing inequality through the tax and transfer system, as well as in supporting growth across the broader economy. It is also timely to consider more recent income inequality data that has been released since the committee tabled its report which shows an improvement across a number of key metrics.</span>

              <span class="HPS-Small">Like most other governments, the Australian Government directs assistance through the welfare system to those who need it most. In fact, the Australian tax and transfer system is among the most progressive in the world in that assistance is overwhelmingly directed to low income earners. According to the 2009-10 Australian Bureau of Statistics' (ABS) Household Expenditure Survey', the poorest 20 per cent of Australian households, on average, receive welfare payments and social services worth more than eight times what they pay in taxes.</span>

              <span class="HPS-Small">The Australian Government's economic approach is focused on delivering continued prosperity for current and future generations of hard-working Australians, to enable those Australians to benefit from their own efforts and to target help to those who most need it. To that end, the Australian Government's budget repair measures are designed to reduce debt and deficits and increase the ability of the Government to respond to economic shocks in a way that supports continued economic growth and employment.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
              <span class="HPS-Small">The Australian Government notes that significant progress has been made in the budget repair task since the opening of the 45th Parliament. More than $20 billion worth of budget repair measures have been legislated with the support of the Senate, including measures from the 2014-15 Budget included in the <span style="font-style:italic;">Budget Savings (Omnibus) Act 2016 </span>which passed with the support of the Opposition. Further measures that have passed and contributed to the Australian Government's budget repair task include fair and sustainable superannuation reforms legislated with the support of the Opposition that target concessions to those who aspire to be self-sufficient in retirement.</span>

              <span class="HPS-Small">In the 44th Parliament, the Australian Government also undertook significant pension reform that will make the pension more sustainable and affordable. The Australian Government appreciates the support of Senators, including the Australian Greens, for the passage of this reform through Parliament and welcomes the Australian Labor Party's recent decision to reverse its opposition to this reform. However the Australian Government is aware that policies adopted by the Opposition would have resulted in $16.5 billion in higher deficits over</span>

              <span class="HPS-Small">One of the most useful ways governments can address inequality is to support economic growth to generate growth in employment and income. The best form of assistance is to help welfare recipients into employment. A key component of the 2016-17 Budget, the Government's <span style="font-style:italic;">National Economic Plan for Jobs and Growth, </span>will ensure Australia continues to successfully transition from the mining investment boom to a stronger, more diversified, new economy. Supporting economic growth will ensure that we can readily respond to future external shocks and can continue to provide assistance to those who need it through well-targeted transfer payments and social services into the future.</span>

              <span class="HPS-Small">While the economy still grew by an encouraging 1.8 per cent through the year, it is not sustainable that real GDP contracted by 0.5 per cent in the September quarter. The Australian economy is growing faster than every G7 economy other than the United Kingdom, slightly better than the United States and Canada and just above the OECD average, highlighting the work we must do to maintain and improve our competitiveness.</span>

              <span class="HPS-Small">Non-mining investment remains subdued and this is one of the biggest challenges we face. We need to support businesses to invest in this country. The Australian economy needs investment that will provide more working hours and higher wages for employees and do its part to take the place left from the decline in mining investment.</span>

              <span class="HPS-Small">The Australian Government plans to assist those businesses, especially small businesses via the Enterprise Tax Plan. Through the Enterprise Tax Plan, the Australian Government is providing the support these companies need to back themselves, back their employees and expand into new products and markets. The Parliament's support for measures to boost investment and growth in the Australian economy will assist the Australian Government in its goal of alleviating poverty and associated inequality.</span>

              <span class="HPS-Small">The Australian Government recognises the importance of effective whole-of­government co-ordination on matters of policy. Consistent with a whole-of­government approach to development, DFAT currently coordinates with other government departments for an integrated and collaborative approach to nutrition development under the aid program. This approach draws on the resources of several departments and agencies based on their comparative strengths and areas of expertise with each leading on matters within its area of responsibility. It is considered the most efficient means of drawing on each department and agency's resources. This also allows stakeholders to directly engage with technical experts on their specific areas of responsibility on nutrition rather than indirectly through a central point of contact. The Government agrees to seek opportunities to strengthen the existing whole-of-government co-ordination on nutrition but does not support designating a central Australian Government 'DFAT point of contact'.</span>

These aid sector strategies were released during 2015 with additional guidance to DFAT staff provided through operational guidance notes. Guided by these policies, the Australian aid program adopts a multi-sectoral approach to responding to the double-burden of malnutrition, including in the health, education, agriculture, water, sanitation and hygiene (WASH), and social protection sectors. The Government does not consider that an intersectional strategy would necessarily provide a higher level of priority, additional resourcing or benefit, to nutrition under the aid program and may disrupt effort already undertaken under the existing policy settings.</span>

This includes support to the implementation of the Pacific Non Communicable Diseases (NCD) Roadmap which was endorsed by Pacific Islands Forum Economic Ministers and Pacific Health Ministers in 2014. A key strategy of the Roadmap is to reduce the consumption of unhealthy food and drinks linked to obesity, diabetes, heart disease and other NCDs through targeted taxes, better regulation and improved public understanding of drivers of NCDs.</span>

For example, FAO is coordinating development of a Global Action Plan for accelerated action to address food and nutrition challenges facing Small Island Developing States (SIDS)—in response to adoption of the SIDS Accelerated Modalities of Action (S.A.M.O.A.) pathway at Apia in September 2014.</span>

For example, in Solomon Islands, Australia's assistance to the Ministry of Health and Medical Services includes nutrition training for health workers and health promotion campaigns. In Tonga, the First 1000 Days program provides public outreach that includes breast feeding, nutrition and physical activity counselling. The LAUNCH Food challenge should also stimulate innovative ideas for public health education campaigns to promote healthy food choices in the Pacific.</span>

In Samoa, Australia funded a Demographic Health Survey module on child under-nutrition (2014) which was the first national survey on child under-nutrition in Samoa since 1999. The Australian Government's innovative partnership with Bloomberg Philanthropies under the Data for Health initiative is working in both PNG and the Solomon Islands to improve data collection and to help governments use data to improve the targeting of health services.
