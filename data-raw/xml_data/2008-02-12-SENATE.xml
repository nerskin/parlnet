<para class="bold">Introduction</para>
<para>On 24 November 2007, Australians voted to elect a new government.</para>
<para>As one of the world’s oldest democracies, it is easy for us to take elections for granted and to fail to appreciate how fortunate we are to live in a nation where governments change hands peacefully as a result of the free expression of the will of the people.</para>
<para>We have just witnessed a change of government, an event that has happened on just six occasions in the past 60 years.</para>
<para>Regardless of any partisan affiliation, all Australians can celebrate the success of our democracy when such changes can occur so seamlessly and with such goodwill.</para>
<para>The new Australian government that was sworn into office on 3 December 2007 is committed to a plan to build a modern Australia equipped to face the challenges of the 21st century.</para>
<para>This plan includes the following priorities:</para>
<list type="bullet">
<item>
<para>strengthening the nation’s long-term economic prospects by prosecuting a new productivity agenda, together with a comprehensive strategy to combat inflation, built on a strong budget surplus and a plan of action on skills and infrastructure; a plan for a ranging program of reform to build over time a world-class education system through early childhood education, computers in schools for all year 9 to 12 students, investing in trades training centres in schools and rebuilding our universities;</para>
</item>
<item>
<para>national leadership in infrastructure development coordinated through Infrastructure Australia;</para>
</item>
<item>
<para>a comprehensive plan to respond to the threat of dangerous climate change that includes ratifying the Kyoto protocol, establishing for the first time a national emissions trading scheme and an ambitious national renewable energy target; long-term measures to begin dealing with urban and rural and regional water supply;</para>
</item>
<item>
<para>reforming our national industrial relations laws to reflect an appropriate balance between fairness and flexibility;</para>
</item>
<item>
<para>a plan to reform the health and hospitals system;</para>
</item>
<item>
<para>increasing the availability of child care as well as increasing the childcare tax rebate;</para>
</item>
<item>
<para>a plan of reforming the Federation by forming partnerships with the states and territories to tackle the legitimate demands of working families for the delivery of better services from all levels of government;</para>
</item>
<item>
<para>strengthening Australia’s national and international efforts to act on emerging and continuing threats to our security, as well as articulating an independent voice in the councils of the world;</para>
</item>
<item>
<para>tackling the growing problem of housing affordability and homelessness; and</para>
</item>
<item>
<para>acting on reconciliation with our Indigenous peoples through an apology to the stolen generations and developing a plan of action to help close the gap between Indigenous and non-Indigenous Australia.</para>
</item>
</list>
<para class="bold">Economic management</para>
<para>In recent months the world economy has entered a period of greater uncertainty.</para>
<para>Although Australia has in recent years benefited from favourable global economic conditions, in particular the rise of China and the global resources boom, the future is uncertain, with downward revisions in global economic growth arising in part from recent developments in the US financial market.</para>
<para>At the same time, on the home front, inflationary pressures have been building over the past several years, creating a further threat to our long-term economic growth.</para>
<para>The government has been mindful of these conflicting economic currents in developing its five-point plan on inflation.</para>
<para>The plan is focused first on fiscal restraint, with the government aiming to deliver a budget surplus of 1.5 per cent of GDP in 2008-09.</para>
<para>Second, the government is examining options to improve private savings.</para>
<para>Third, it will tackle the chronic skills shortages that have been driving inflationary pressure in many areas of the economy for some years.</para>
<para>Fourth is a plan of action on infrastructure bottlenecks.</para>
<para>And, fifth, the government aims to act on the workforce participation rate by providing practical ways of helping people re-enter the workforce.</para>
<para>The government is committed to maintaining a strong budgetary position by adhering to a medium-term fiscal strategy that keeps the budget in surplus, on average, over the economic cycle; by reprioritising existing expenditure; and by maximising public sector efficiency.</para>
<para class="bold">Economic reform</para>
<para>The government is also committed to improving the quality of government by focusing on outlays that boost the long-term productive capacity of the economy—rather than consumption.</para>
<para>Building long-term productivity growth following many years of declining productivity growth is a core priority of the nation if we are to have improved living standards for working families into the future.</para>
<para>The government’s productivity agenda includes reforms to education, infrastructure, innovation, workplace relations and reforming the Federation.</para>
<para>Central to the government’s productivity agenda is its commitment to building a world-class education system. The government’s long-term ambition is to produce the best-educated workforce in the world. The rest of the world is not standing still, as they invest billions into human capital.</para>
<para>The government is committed to a plan of action to prevent Australia falling further behind against critical global benchmarks. That is why the government is committed to an education revolution.</para>
<para>Advanced infrastructure is critically important to raising Australia’s productivity in the long term.</para>
<para>The government, in cooperation with the states and territories, will focus on better coordination of infrastructure planning and investment—both public and private.</para>
<para>Nationally consistent public-private partnerships will be critical in this regard.</para>
<para>Infrastructure Australia will be established to improve planning and coordination of Australia’s transport, water and energy infrastructure.</para>
<para>The government will also work with the private sector to build a high-speed national broadband network—the critical infrastructure platform of the 21st century, with the capacity to fundamentally transform business, to overcome much of the tyranny of distance and to boost productivity growth.</para>
<para>Innovation is another key driver of productivity and economic growth. The government aims to foster a culture of innovation by strengthening investment in creativity and knowledge generation.</para>
<para>It will establish the Enterprise Connect Network to link business with new ideas and technology. Incentives for business research and development will be focused on lifting investment and competitiveness.</para>
<para>The office of Chief Scientist will once again become a full-time position.</para>
<para>The Commonwealth is establishing a new framework for cooperative Commonwealth-state relations in order to take practical steps to rationalise intergovernmental responsibilities and achieve better outcomes in areas of national priority.</para>
<para>The Council of Australian Governments, COAG, recognised at its meeting in December 2007 that there is a need for greater cooperation between Commonwealth and state governments and this should be an immediate priority.</para>
<para>Commonwealth-state funding arrangements will focus more on outputs and outcomes, underpinned by a commitment from the Commonwealth government to provide incentive payments to drive reforms.</para>
<para>At the December COAG meeting, Australian heads of government identified the regulatory burden on business as an impediment to efficiency that needs to be lifted.</para>
<para>Priority areas for action that have been identified include occupational health and safety regulation, payroll tax administration, building codes, trade and professional recognition, simplified accounting methods for the hospitality sector and simplification of the business activity statement.</para>
<para>The government is therefore committed to a significant agenda of economic reform across the spectrum of human capital, physical capital and regulatory reform—with the overriding agenda of building long-term productivity growth.</para>
<para class="bold">Work and family</para>
<para>Workplace arrangements should deliver flexibility for employers and employees, fair wages and conditions, productive work practices and a balance between work and family responsibilities.</para>
<para>To meet these objectives, the government will be introducing a new workplace relations system.</para>
<para>In its first legislative act, the government will abolish the capacity to make Australian workplace agreements.</para>
<para>The new workplace relations system will provide a strong safety net of minimum conditions, the right to bargain collectively for wages and conditions and fairness for both employers and employees if an employee is dismissed.</para>
<para>These elements will ensure that employees can fully participate in the benefits of a growing economy, while fostering productivity growth and low inflation.</para>
<para>The government is committed to further measures that will relieve the pressures on working parents and help them to get the balance right as they juggle their work and family responsibilities.</para>
<para>The government’s initiatives in this area include:</para>
<list type="bullet">
<item>
<para>more flexible parental leave;</para>
</item>
<item>
<para>an increased focus on high-quality early childhood education and child care; and</para>
</item>
<item>
<para>assistance to small businesses wanting to develop family-friendly practices.</para>
</item>
</list>
<para>Ensuring that parents have access to affordable, high-quality child care that helps them to balance their work and family responsibilities is a high priority for the government.</para>
<para>To further assist parents with the cost of child care, the government will increase the childcare tax rebate from 30 per cent to 50 per cent of out-of-pocket childcare costs.</para>
<para>The government will also improve access to quality child care through the establishment of up to 260 new childcare centres on school, TAFE, university and community sites, and through the introduction of a five-star quality rating system.</para>
<para>Families will also benefit from the introduction of universal access to early childhood education for all four-year-olds for 15 hours per week and 40 weeks per year, and the national rollout of the Australian Early Development Index, which will help communities throughout Australia understand how children are developing by the time they reach school age.</para>
<para class="bold">Education</para>
<para>The government was elected on a platform of implementing major changes to Australia’s education system, with the aim of achieving higher standards and better results at every level of education from early childhood to mature age.</para>
<para>The government believes that lifting the quantity of investment in education and the quality of educational outcomes is highly important to Australia’s long-term productivity growth and economic prosperity.</para>
<para>The government will provide universal access to high-quality early childhood education for Australian children so they can build foundations for lifelong learning.</para>
<para>In schools, there will be a major focus on reforms to improve literacy and numeracy outcomes and lift year 12 retention rates.</para>
<para>The development of a national curriculum in the key areas of mathematics, science, English, history and Asian languages aims to ensure high, nationally consistent standards for all students across Australia.</para>
<para>In partnership with the states and territories, the government will work to enhance schools’ educational infrastructure.</para>
<para>Funding of $2.5 billion will be provided for secondary schools to build or upgrade trade training centres over the next 10 years.</para>
<para>The government will invest $1 billion in the provision of computers for year 9 to 12 students and faster broadband connections to schools.</para>
<para>The government will also create an additional 450,000 training places over four years, including 65,000 extra apprenticeships, with the first 20,000 places to be available from April 2008.</para>
<para>These initiatives will enhance employment prospects for young Australians and address critical skills shortages.</para>
<para>In higher education, the demand for graduates in maths, science and early childhood education will be addressed through incentives for graduates in relevant occupations, including the teaching profession.</para>
<para>To help attract and retain the best talent, the government will improve and expand the Commonwealth Scholarships Program for both undergraduates and postgraduates and offer new four-year fellowships valued at $140,000 a year to 1,000 leading researchers.</para>
<para>Domestic undergraduate full-fee-paying places at public universities will be phased out.</para>
<para class="bold">Health</para>
<para>The government is committed to ending the blame game between Canberra and the states and territories on health and hospitals.</para>
<para>The government believes the Australian people deserve better than a culture of buck-passing between levels of government.</para>
<para>That is why health and hospitals form such a vital part of the COAG reform agenda for 2008.</para>
<para>The government understands that this reform task will not be easy and success is far from guaranteed.</para>
<para>Working closely with the states and territories, reform will focus on funding for improving performance and health outcomes in key areas across the health system, including:</para>
<list type="bullet">
<item>
<para>pressures on emergency departments;</para>
</item>
<item>
<para>elective surgery waiting lists beyond clinically acceptable time frames;</para>
</item>
<item>
<para>the intersection between aged care and the hospital system; and</para>
</item>
<item>
<para>better integration of preventative health care to tackle challenges such as obesity and chronic disease.</para>
</item>
</list>
<para>This includes funding to the states and territories to act on elective surgery waiting lists, funding for GP superclinics, increasing the number of operational aged-care places and providing additional nurses for our healthcare system.</para>
<para>Importantly, more support will be provided to health services in rural communities.  </para>
<para>Beyond these programs, the government will re‑establish the Commonwealth Dental Care Program.</para>
<para>Hundreds of thousands of Australians have been waiting years to have the most basic dental work done.</para>
<para>That is why the government will commit $290 million to fund up to one million extra dental consultations over three years.</para>
<para>Failure to act on dental health is bad for general health, bad for self-esteem and bad for those seeking to break the unemployment cycle.</para>
<para class="bold">Climate change and water</para>
<para>The government considers that climate change represents one of Australia’s greatest long-term economic and environmental challenges.</para>
<para>Scientific evidence continues to underscore the seriousness of the threat of climate change and the urgency of action that is needed at a global, national and local level.</para>
<para>In one of its first actions, the Australian government ratified the Kyoto protocol and so joined the community of nations in the truly global challenge facing our common humanity.</para>
<para>The government intends to play an active and significant role in the post-Bali negotiations to develop a comprehensive new agreement on climate change.</para>
<para>The government has committed to reducing Australia’s greenhouse gas emissions by 60 per cent on 2000 levels by 2050.</para>
<para>A major study to help Australia set robust shorter-term emission reduction targets will report in mid-2008.</para>
<para>To help Australia meet its emissions reductions goals, a national emissions trading scheme will be established by the end of 2010.</para>
<para>The government will also set a 20 per cent target for renewable energy by 2020 to expand the use of renewable energy sources such as solar and wind power.</para>
<para>The Commonwealth will work cooperatively with the states and territories to tackle the water crisis and respond to the impacts of climate change, including in the Murray-Darling Basin that supports over 40 per cent of Australia’s food production.</para>
<para>The government will invest in modernising irrigation infrastructure and purchasing water entitlements from willing sellers to put our river systems on a sustainable footing.</para>
<para>A $1 billion fund will be established to invest in new and reliable water supplies for urban Australia—including desalination and recycling—and rebates will be available for families to invest in water conservation at home.</para>
<para>The prolonged and severe dry conditions in parts of Australia have had a serious impact on the livelihood of rural Australia.</para>
<para>While recent weeks have seen rains in many parts of Australia, long-term water shortages remain an acute concern.</para>
<para>The government will implement climate change adaptation programs to help support farmers in adapting farming practices as they face the changing climate.</para>
<para>The government’s drought policy will ensure that farmers receiving government assistance are better prepared to deal with the increasing frequency of dry conditions predicted for the future.</para>
<para class="bold">Housing</para>
<para>The government plans several measures to address challenges relating to housing affordability and homelessness.</para>
<para>Homeownership is out of reach for many Australian families, and many Australian cities are experiencing large increases in rental costs and a shortage of rental stock.</para>
<para>This is of particular concern because the current shortage of housing supply affects the most disadvantaged people in the Australian community.  </para>
<para>The government will establish first home saver accounts—accounts that reward disciplined savings with government contributions.</para>
<para>These will help people save a larger home deposit and will improve affordability.</para>
<para>The government will also increase housing supply and make houses less expensive—by releasing Commonwealth land for housing, by investing $500 million in housing-linked infrastructure and by providing financial incentives to encourage private sector investment in affordable rental properties.</para>
<para>The government understands there is no single solution to the crisis in housing affordability.</para>
<para>Any attempt at improving affordability needs to involve the three levels of government working together with the community and private sectors.</para>
<para>A national housing strategy will be implemented. Working with the states, territories and local government, a National Housing Affordability Agreement will be developed which incorporates measures to improve housing affordability for home buyers, renters and public housing tenants.</para>
<para class="bold">Social inclusion</para>
<para>The government will implement a new policy agenda focused on social inclusion. The focus on social inclusion aims to improve the opportunities for all Australians to participate fully in Australian economic and social life.</para>
<para>In working to advance social inclusion, the government will work in close partnership with state, territory and local governments, business and the not-for-profit sector.</para>
<para>Policies that aim to improve social inclusion and address disadvantage include the government’s commitment to halve the number of homeless people turned away from homeless services each year, for the next five years; universal access to preschool for four-year-old children; a national action plan on literacy and numeracy; establishing a dental health program; halving the gap in mortality rates of Indigenous and non-Indigenous children under the age of five within a decade; achieving a 90 per cent year 12 retention rate by 2020; and developing a national employment strategy for those with a disability or mental illness. </para>
<para class="bold">Indigenous policy</para>
<para>The government is committed to advancing reconciliation between Indigenous and non‑Indigenous Australia, beginning with a formal apology to the stolen generations and extending to a range of initiatives aimed at closing the gap between Indigenous and non-Indigenous Australians in health outcomes and educational achievement.</para>
<para>Across the Australian community, there is a strong sense that we have more work to do to bring about reconciliation between Indigenous and non‑Indigenous Australians.</para>
<para>One of the great privileges of serving in the office of Governor-General is the opportunity to see and experience so much of our nation’s rich Indigenous cultures.</para>
<para>Serving in this role also makes one more acutely aware that, while we have made progress, we still have a distance to travel.</para>
<para>The richness of Indigenous culture is often under-recognised, and as a nation we have much to learn about the history of Indigenous Australians—a history that stretches over 60,000 years.</para>
<para>The government’s intention to develop a national curriculum in history offers the prospect that more of this history could be incorporated into our education programs.</para>
<para>The apology to the stolen generations that will go before the parliament tomorrow represents an important further step towards reconciliation, and I commend the intention to you, honourable members and senators, and indeed all Australians, as worthy of your support.</para>
<para>The government acknowledges Indigenous affairs as a key priority.</para>
<para>The government will seek to rebuild the relationship with Indigenous people and communities based on respect, and involve Indigenous leaders and communities in important decisions.</para>
<para>Working with COAG partners, the government intends to focus on closing the gap on Indigenous disadvantage, focusing on three specific areas:</para>
<list type="bullet">
<item>
<para>closing the 17-year life expectancy gap within a generation;</para>
</item>
<item>
<para>halving the gap in mortality rates for Indigenous children under five within a decade; and</para>
</item>
<item>
<para>halving the gap in reading, writing and numeracy achievements within a decade.</para>
</item>
</list>
<para class="bold">National security and international relations</para>
<para>The government intends to strengthen Australia’s relationship with both traditional allies and regional partners, while also re-engaging with Australia’s tradition of active middle-power diplomacy to address the range of transnational challenges that will define our future, including the threat of terrorism, nuclear proliferation, new threats to border security, human security, as well as the impact of climate change.</para>
<para>Australia’s alliance with the United States will remain central to Australia’s strategic interests.</para>
<para>A stronger working relationship between Australia and the United Nations is also a priority.</para>
<para>The government’s support for the United Nations and multilateral approaches recognises that cooperative engagement is a core means of securing long-term peace and development.  </para>
<para>The government will also work to strengthen relations with countries in the Asia-Pacific region in light of its importance to Australia’s economic prosperity and regional stability.</para>
<para>The government recognises that there are both immediate and potential longer term threats to Australia’s national security.</para>
<para>The government will develop a national security strategy statement to guide our military, police, diplomatic and international assistance efforts as we face the security challenges of the 21st century.</para>
<para>The government will commission a defence white paper to guide defence capability and ensure that defence expenditure provides the Defence Force that Australia needs.</para>
<para>In consultation with the United States, the United Kingdom and Iraq, the government will withdraw Australian combat troops from Iraq at the end of the next rotation, due for completion in mid-2008.</para>
<para>To contribute to a secure and stable Iraq, Australia will enhance its humanitarian and development assistance to Iraq.</para>
<para>Australian troops will continue to be deployed in Afghanistan as part of the international force in that region.</para>
<para>The government is also committed to stability and security in our immediate region, where the Australian Defence Force and Australian Federal Police perform crucial stabilisation and support roles in East Timor and the Solomon Islands.</para>
<para>The government is committed to strengthening Australia’s export performance.</para>
<para>The multilateral trading system and the World Trade Organisation Doha Round negotiations will be placed at the centre of Australia’s trade policy. Australia will continue to support regional and bilateral free trade agreements which are compatible with, and enhance, multilateral outcomes.</para>
<para>Measures will also be taken to lift Australia’s export competitiveness.</para>
<para>During recent years there has been a growing recognition that, with coordinated international efforts, major progress can be made on reducing global poverty.</para>
<para>The government will lift Australia’s contribution to these efforts in support of the internationally agreed Millennium Development Goals.</para>
<para>The government will increase the level of Australia’s overseas development assistance to 0.5 per cent of gross national income by 2015-16.</para>
<para>Australia’s aid program will play a critical role in promoting economic development, reducing instability and improving governance in the South Pacific. </para>
<para class="bold">Governance and transparency</para>
<para>The government will implement new measures to help make government more accessible to the community and more transparent in its decision making.</para>
<para>The government will hold regular community cabinet meetings in capital cities, regional towns and remote communities across Australia.</para>
<para>The government began this in Perth in January.</para>
<para>These meetings will give Australians from all walks of life the opportunity to talk to government ministers on a broad range of national and local issues.</para>
<para>The government is seeking to prepare Australia for the challenges of the future.</para>
<para>To do so, it has stated its preparedness to listen to the ideas that Australians have for the future of our country.</para>
<para>On 19 and 20 April, the government will convene an Australia 2020 Summit.</para>
<para>This summit will bring together 1,000 of Australia’s best and brightest minds to discuss and debate Australia’s long-term future.</para>
<para>The government is committed to then examining the policy ideas that arise from the summit and reporting back on them later in the year.</para>
<para>The government wants to leave no stone unturned to ensure Australia is on the right track for the future—and that means listening to Australians to hear their ideas for our country’s future.</para>
<para>It is important for the nation to lift its planning horizon beyond the three-year electoral cycle and to begin serious planning for the decade ahead and beyond.</para>
<para>Laws relating to government information will be enhanced by promoting a culture of disclosure and transparency.</para>
<para>This includes enhanced budget transparency by providing greater disclosure of accessible and useful government financial information.</para>
<para>A Freedom of Information Commissioner will be appointed to take overall responsibility for access to government information and improve review processes.</para>
<para class="bold">Conclusion</para>
<para>The Australian government is committed to building a modern Australia capable of meeting the challenges of the future.</para>
<para>It is committed to bringing a fresh approach to governing.</para>
<para>It is committed to being a government that listens to the Australian people, that consults with the Australian people and that is upfront with the Australian people on the problems it can solve—and the problems that lie beyond the powers of any government to solve.</para>
<para>The Australian government has a vision for Australia’s long-term future.</para>
<para>The government wants to seize the great opportunities that lie before us and make Australia competitive on every level with the rest of the world, with the aim of making this great country of ours an even greater place in which to live.</para>

<para>—by leave—I have the honour to inform the Senate that, following the election held on 24 November 2007 in which the Australian Labor Party was elected to government, the Governor-General commissioned the Prime Minister to form a government. Ministers and parliamentary secretaries were appointed on 3 December 2007. For the information of honourable senators, I have a list of the full ministry. The document lists all ministers and parliamentary secretaries and the offices they hold. It shows those ministers who comprise the cabinet and provides details of representation arrangements in each chamber. I seek leave to have the document incorporated in <inline font-style="italic">Hansard</inline>.</para>

<para>I would like to congratulate all our frontbenchers on their election to the roles of ministers and parliamentary secretaries and place on record my thanks to other members of the government team who served on the front bench—some of them over a long period of time—over the years we were in opposition for the contribution they made to the election of the Rudd Labor government. I would also like to congratulate the Northern Territory and ACT senators on their re-election to the parliament, and I would like to acknowledge the election of Senator Minchin as Leader of the Opposition in the Senate—a job which I hope he holds for many years—and Senator Abetz likewise as Deputy Leader of the Opposition in the Senate.</para>
<para>Mr President, I thank you for the manner in which you conducted the welcome to country ceremony today and I thank the officers of the parliament for their cooperation in facilitating it. I think it brought great credit to the parliament and its officers. I also acknowledge the role that Senator George Campbell played as a whip and thank him for his services.</para>
<para>There is one final thankyou: I understand that one of our favourite attendants, Lorna Lane, is giving it away at the end of the week. On behalf of the government, I would like to acknowledge her contribution to the parliament and wish her all the best.</para>

<para>—by leave—On behalf of the opposition, I congratulate Senator Evans and other ministers and office holders on their appointments. I congratulate the Labor Party on their election to government. They have been given an enormous responsibility by the people of Australia. It is our business and our job now to hold them to account for the responsibility they have for governing this great nation.</para>
</talk.start>
<para>I inform the Senate that, as Senator Evans alluded to, I have been elected Leader of the Opposition in the Senate—a job I intend to hold for as little time as possible—and Senator Abetz the Deputy Leader. Senator Ellison is the Manager of Opposition Business and Senator Parry the Opposition Whip, with Senator Judith Adams as his deputy. Senator Scullion has been elected as the Leader of the Nationals in the Senate, and I congratulate him on that election and on his election as a senator for the Northern Territory. He will presently inform the Senate of other arrangements for the National Party.</para>

<para class="block">That we re affirm our support for the Constitution of the Commonwealth of Australia which states “Whereas the people of New South Wales, Victoria, South Australia, Queensland and Tasmania humbly relying on the blessing of Almighty God, have agreed to unite in one indissoluble Federal Commonwealth” (Constitution Act 9th July 1900) and the affirmation of 69% of our Australian population that they are Christians, and the statement of one of our founders that “this Commonwealth of Australia from its first stage will be a Christian Commonwealth” (Sir John Downer 1898), and the Opening Prayer of the Parliaments “Almighty God we humbly beseech Thee to vouchsafe Thy blessing upon this Parliament. Direct and prosper our deliberations to the advancement of Thy glory” and recognises the importance of these beliefs in ensuring the ongoing stability and unity of our Christian nation.</para>

<para>Adopt a ten year moratorium on Muslim immigration, so an assessment can be made on the social and political disharmony currently occurring in the Netherlands, France and the UK, so as to ensure we avoid making the same mistakes; and allow a decade for the Muslim leadership and community in Australia to reassess their situation so as to reject any attempt to establish a Muslim nation within our Australian nation.</para>

<para>—The opposition does not oppose this motion. However, I point out that there was an amendment to paragraph (2), inserting the reason why this should be given such priority. Obviously, it is a matter of history and that is why the words ‘That, recognising the historic importance of a National Apology to the Stolen Generations, the first item of business’ are included. I want to make that clear to the Senate.</para>
</talk.start>
<para>The other aspect is that this is unprecedented in nature due to the fact that we will be having a debate with a limited number of speakers. The motion will then be moved and, later on, the debate will continue under the guise of ‘taking note’. That is unprecedented and, for the record—quite separate from the subject matter, which is an important issue—it should be recognised that this is an unprecedented procedure being used on a historic occasion. People who look back on this measure and the way it was dealt with procedurally should not take this as a precedent for the future. This is a course taken only due to the unique issue that we are dealing with. Normal procedure in the Senate is to have a debate. Once everyone who wishes to participate in that debate has spoken, the motion is put and then voted upon. That is the normal procedure. In this case, it will be different. We appreciate why and we have agreed to that, but, just for the record, we believe that the points I have made should be spelt out for posterity.</para>

<para>—On behalf of the Greens, I want to concur with the Leader of the Opposition but go further and say that we do not support the arrangement which effectively means that those senators who speak after the vote is taken will have their contribution to this historic debate downgraded. There is no way that that will not occur. Every senator is elected equal to this place and every senator has an equal right to contribute to this debate. At the end, the debate should go to a vote, not least because of but most because of the historic nature of the move to extend an apology to the stolen generations.</para>
</talk.start>
<para>I am very concerned that there is a lack of respect for this chamber in this move by the government. We all have a right as senators to contribute to something as important as this. We know that the procedure tomorrow is being tightly controlled by the government, and we wish the government well. I will be contributing to the congratulations to the government on making this move, but the process in here is not right. It should not be depriving every senator of their contribution to this historic debate. It was simply a matter of the government scheduling the final vote to be taken on Thursday or giving everybody a five-minute contribution. We could have finished it tomorrow afternoon, but the government, in the process it has set out, is taking away from the due respect that every senator has a right to speak in this place. While we support the motion to bring on the matter for debate tomorrow, we do not support that component. I put on the record that we do not support the component which says that those senators who contribute after the vote will effectively be doing so as also-rans.</para>

<para>—I just want to make a couple of comments in response. I thank the chamber for the cooperation shown in terms of support for this motion. I understand that the procedure is unusual, but, as Senator Ellison quite rightly pointed out, this is a historic occasion. We have attempted to get the cooperation of the Senate in order to do this in a proper way and to show proper respect for those people who are waiting for the apology. I appreciate that Senator Minchin and other party leaders have shown cooperation on that. I understand, with 28 votes in this chamber, that I am not capable of delivering that on behalf of the government—that it requires the cooperation of others. I put on record my appreciation of that and the indication of support for the motion.</para>
</talk.start>
<para>Senator Bob Brown, it is not a question of not respecting the chamber. When we discussed this at a meeting of the leaders and whips, we all understood that it is actually a question of respecting those Indigenous people to whom we apologise.</para>

<para>—Senator Brown, you were represented at the meeting and we just came to the conclusion that the best way was to have some finality to the issue on the day when the apology was made in the House of Representatives and that we did so in the Senate at the same time. That was the consensus that we reached. As I said, I appreciate the cooperation on that matter. What we have done in moving a second motion, effectively noting the apology, is try to facilitate the ability of all senators to contribute to the debate about the apology and to express their views on it. I know it is an unusual method, but it met the two requirements that we sought to achieve: firstly, to finalise the apology—have the expression of the view of the parliament on the day when the House of Representatives and the Senate debate the issue; and, secondly, to ensure that every senator has the ability to contribute to the debate.</para>
</talk.start>
</continue>
<para>There are a lot of government senators who want to speak, but the reality is that if we allow a full debate on the Wednesday, given the normal scheduling of events, it would not conclude on the Wednesday but would roll over to Thursday. If everyone who wanted to speak did speak, potentially it might have to then be deferred until we return in three or four weeks time. Clearly that is not an appropriate way to proceed.</para>
<para>I think we have come to a reasonable compromise. I understand the concerns expressed. I do not think in any way the contributions of senators later on tomorrow will be downgraded. They will be in the <inline font-style="italic">Hansard</inline>; they will be an expression of their views. I know Labor senators will take the opportunity to speak and I certainly will not devalue any of the contributions that are made. So I think it is a question on this occasion of balancing the respect for the institution of the Senate and its procedures with the respect for those to whom we seek to apologise on behalf of the nation tomorrow. I think we have got the balance right, and I appreciate the support of the chamber.</para>

</talker>
<para>—I wanted to put briefly the Democrats’ perspective on this issue. I think, frankly, Senator Evans has got it about right. It is not an ideal process but it is an unusual arrangement, as I think has been said in another context. This apology is not about all of us getting a say; this apology is for Indigenous Australians. Obviously it is important what is said in this chamber and what is decided by this chamber and in the other place, but what is also extremely important is the experiences of so many Indigenous Australians, particularly members of the stolen generations themselves and what they experience tomorrow in particular. The role the Senate plays in debating this motion, and I assume in passing it, is just one part of that wider experience and the wider impact it will have on them.</para>
</talk.start>
<para>I think it is right to suggest that this should not become a precedent as a matter of course. These are an unusual set of circumstances but there will be, of course, opportunities for all of us to put our views before this chamber, not just about this motion but the wider issues regarding the stolen generations, as I and many in the Democrats have for many years and as others will continue to do. When we are talking about a historic, unique and formal type of process and motion such as this, I think it is understandable to need to take into account not just our needs as a chamber but what works best, particularly for the many Indigenous people who are looking to tomorrow with great anticipation. That role should not be forgotten.</para>
<para>I would also note that my understanding is that, whilst less than ideal, it is still somewhat better than what is being proposed in the House of Representatives, where I think it is just the Leader of the Opposition and the Prime Minister and nobody else, neither Independents nor the National Party, who will get a guernsey at all there. What we have is a slight improvement on that and at least a recognition of the full diversity of voices who are getting an opportunity to be heard through the party representative structure. I think it is satisfactory given the context and is a unique set of circumstances. But, as all senators would appreciate, it certainly will not be the last time that the Democrats or anybody else, I imagine, hopefully, will be debating these issues, because there is a lot of other unfinished business regarding the stolen generations and the <inline font-style="italic">Bringing them home</inline> report and we need to be continuing to debate that in this chamber. The formal resolution tomorrow is a unique circumstance and, given the context and the other activities that are happening around here and in this house, as opposed to in this chamber, I think it is a reasonable compromise.</para>

<para>That the Senate records its deep regret at the death, on 12 October 2007, of the Honourable Kim Edward Beazley, AC, former federal minister and member for Fremantle, and places on record its appreciation of his long meritorious public service and tenders its profound sympathy to his family.</para>
</motion>
<para class="block">Unlike the people referred to on some occasions in condolence motions, I actually knew Kim Beazley Sr. He was a learned and courteous man who continued to contribute to public life right up until his passing. He, of course, was a great Labor hero. In my youth he was one of the men who I looked up to. He was an inspiration to many young Labor people as they became interested in politics. I had the honour of attending his funeral, representing the Prime Minister, Kevin Rudd—as senators would understand, it was in the period leading up to the federal election. There was a very good attendance of current and former members of parliament from both sides of politics. We certainly appreciated that. Of course, former Prime Ministers Keating, Hawke and Whitlam all attended and the former Governor-General, Bill Hayden, was also there. I think that is a sign of the respect with which Kim Beazley Sr was held.</para>
<para>At the age of 28, he entered the House of Representatives as its youngest member, representing the Western Australian electorate of Fremantle. During his 32 years in parliament, Kim earned the respect of both sides of politics and was widely recognised as one of the best parliamentary debaters and orators of his time. Kim was a great Labor figure, often said to be the ‘conscience of the Labor Party’. His career was deeply influenced by his Christian faith and his passion for education and Indigenous issues. I think he would appreciate what the parliament intends to do tomorrow very much. He made a significant and lasting contribution in government and in opposition and has had a defining influence on policy both nationally and within the Labor Party. In 1979 he was awarded the Order of Australia. Kim Beazley Sr died in Perth on 12 October 2007 at the age of 90, leaving a country so much the richer for his many years on earth.</para>
<para>In his early life, Kim had a sort of classic working-class upbringing and often went barefooted to school. In fact, when the Duke and Duchess of York visited his primary school in Fremantle in 1927 he was assigned to flag waving at the back because he had no shoes. Despite not being able to afford school shoes, his mother knew the value of something much more important—education. Kim would later say:</para>
<quote>
<para class="block">... we might have been bare-footed, but we could recite Wordsworth.</para>
</quote>
<para class="block">Kim topped the state in English and history and gained a scholarship to Perth Modern School, the alumni of a number of great Australians, including Sir Paul Hasluck, Dr ‘Nugget’ Coombs, Bob Hawke, John Stone and my partner, Miriam. He subsequently studied at Claremont Teachers’ College and then the University of Western Australia.</para>
<para>In 1937 he commenced work with the education department and taught successively at Richmond, a school in East Fremantle, Arthur River, Midland Junction and Claremont. At the time of his nomination for the Fremantle seat in 1945 he was living in Claremont and tutoring at Claremont Teachers’ Training College. He had also tutored at the University of Western Australia and became vice-president of the state school teachers’ union and a member of the Australian Teachers’ Federation.</para>
<para>Kim Beazley Sr first joined the ALP through the Labor Club of the University of WA and became a delegate to the metropolitan council and member of the state executive. He became the ALP senior vice-president and was a member of the federal executive of the ALP. In 1945, on the sudden death of the Prime Minister, John Curtin, he was endorsed for and won the seat of Fremantle. In a field of six candidates, he won the seat with an absolute majority of nearly 9,000 votes, and, at 28, became the youngest member of the House of Representatives. A year later he defeated his Liberal opponent in the 1946 general election by almost 20,000 votes. His majority went up and down over the years, but he continued to hold the seat strongly for Labor.</para>
<para>His youthful looks and intellect earned him the nickname of ‘the student prince’, but he was also known by some of his colleagues, not entirely charitably, as ‘the young Lochinvar’. Not surprisingly, when Kim Beazley Sr first entered parliament, he was immediately touted as having ministerial potential. When Labor won government under Gough Whitlam in 1972, Kim held the education portfolio throughout the government’s three-year span. Mungo MacCallum described Kim Beazley Sr as a ‘towering and intimidating figure with something of the style of an Old Testament prophet’. He was renowned for his deep Christian faith and strong moral stances on issues that led to some testing relationships with members of his own party.</para>
<para>Kim’s commitment to the Christian faith never wavered, even if politically it may not have been the most pragmatic thing for him to do. In 1953, Kim Beazley Sr became involved in the Moral Rearmament Movement and made a commitment to ‘concern myself daily with the challenge of how to live out God’s will and to turn the searchlight of absolute honesty onto my motives.’ He committed himself very much to the work of the Moral Rearmament Movement. Many within the Labor Party felt uneasy at Kim’s commitment to honesty and the Christian faith. Alan Reid, an influential correspondent of the time, wrote that Beazley was facing political destruction taking such a highly principled approach to politics. Reid wrote:</para>
<quote>
<para class="block">Powerful office-hungry individuals fear that his idealism and his current determination to pursue truth, whatever the price, could cost the Labor Party the next election. The story they are assiduously and effectively peddling is, ‘Beazley has lost his balance.’</para>
</quote>
<para class="block">However, it was far from destroying Kim; he went on to become one of Australia’s most successful education ministers and played an influential role within the ALP. The election of the Whitlam government gave Kim Beazley Sr the opportunity, after 27 years in parliament, to a make a real difference as education minister. Driven by his sense of fairness and equality, Kim Beazley Sr was responsible for some of the most influential education reforms in Australia’s history. Perhaps his crowning achievement in education was the abolition of university fees, to provide free education for a generation of tertiary students, of which I am one. Also, under his watch as education minister, enrolments in technical education leaped from 400,000 to 705,000.</para>
<para>Kim was also responsible for introducing government funding for both private and public schools. He said at the time, ‘The Constitution doesn’t say that the Commonwealth may give benefits to the states, but nothing to Catholics. What we must do is look at all Australian children as Commonwealth citizens, and meet their needs.’ Kim cared deeply for those most in need—in particular underprivileged children. He once said: ‘We love the brilliant child and the scholar, but what about the others—children who are physically, socially, or geographically handicapped, children who go to school without the precognitive use of speech because they were without books or intelligent conversation? These are my first priorities.’ As education minister, Kim implemented a range of Commonwealth programs to help Indigenous children, migrant children and children with special needs, as well as providing assistance for people to embark on technical and adult education. Kim’s work ethic and desire to make Australia’s education system more equitable were second to none. His work ethic once led to his collapsing of exhaustion after embarking on a barnstorming campaign which saw him speaking every night, jumping from state to state, to explain the Karmel committee recommendations to provide funding to government and non-government schools through a grants program.</para>
<para>As this parliament prepares to say sorry to a generation of people who were removed from their families as children, it is pertinent that Kim’s passion for the rights of Aboriginal people is acknowledged. Kim’s commitment to this issue was an enduring feature of his life, both in and out of parliament. In 1952, he was the first member of federal parliament to raise the issue of Aboriginal land rights but, as we know, it took years before anything was implemented. His passionate advocacy for Aboriginal rights inspired many. Former Western Australian Premier Geoff Gallop has said that he would never forget, as a student, listening to Mr Beazley Sr speak about Indigenous rights. Kim pushed for and was successful in having Aboriginal land rights installed into the Labor Party platform and was the parliamentary representative on the council of the Australian Institute of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Studies from 1964 to 1972. One of the first things he initiated as Minister for Education was to enable Aboriginal children to be taught in their own languages—with English as a second language—and within three years Aboriginal children around Australia were being taught in 22 of their own languages. Kim also introduced scholarships for Indigenous children to encourage and assist them to gain an education.</para>
<para>After his parliamentary career, Kim Beazley Sr did not stand down from public life. He headed a major ground-breaking inquiry into Western Australia’s education system, the results of which form the foundations of the current Western Australian education system. Kim chaired a joint parliamentary lay committee which investigated aspects of parliamentary privilege during the term of the Dowding WA state Labor government. He continued his passionate interest in Aboriginal rights and remained a very strong public advocate. He also kept a grassroots connection with the Labor Party: up to the age of 80, he and his partner, Betty, held branch meetings in his house in Cottesloe. Betty has remained active at the branch level to this day.</para>
<para>There is no doubt that Kim Edward Beazley was one of Australia’s most respected political postwar figures, not so much for the relatively brief yet remarkable achievements of his time as federal Minister for Education, but for his consistently righteous stand on issues affecting public life. On behalf of the government, I wish to offer our sincere thanks to a man who made such an enormous contribution to the parliament and to public life. Last year was a very difficult year for the Beazley family. Sadly, Kim Beazley Senior’s younger son, David, died last year as well. We extend our condolences to his wife, Betty, and to his children, Kim Beazley Jr and Merrilyn Wasson, and their respective families. They have much to be proud of on the passing of a very great Australian.</para>

<para>—I have pleasure in rising on behalf of the coalition to support the motion by Senator Evans and extend our sympathies to the family of Kim Beazley Sr upon his very sad passing on 12 October 2007. There is no doubt that Kim Beazley was a true stalwart of the Labor Party. He had a tremendous political career. He was very well respected on all sides of politics, both during his long service as a member of the House of Representatives and in his retirement. It is certainly true that the Labor Party has lost one of its real gentlemen, and the Australian people have lost a very loyal former representative.</para>
</talk.start>
<para>Senator Evans has detailed Mr Beazley’s long and distinguished political career, which I will not repeat. I note that he had probably one of the longest parliamentary careers in our history, and spent over one-third of his life in this place. Regrettably for him, he spent some 25 of his 32 years in opposition. He had the great misfortune that his career coincided with the long reign of the coalition under Sir Robert Menzies. How on earth anyone could put up with 25 years of opposition is certainly beyond me, so I applaud Mr Beazley’s clear resolve, tenacity and commitment to his cause. I think he was acknowledged by all sides of politics as a man of great principle, and he endeavoured to ensure that those principles guided his decision making. Indeed, many on our side of politics had great respect for his deep commitment to his Christian faith. That led to many coalition members of parliament having much in common with Kim Beazley on the great moral issues of our time. I should note that he also had, as a parent, the great good fortune to see his son Kim enter politics and have a very distinguished career as a senior figure in the Australian Labor Party. I think that Kim Beazley Jr shares many of his father’s great qualities and he is unlucky not to have had the opportunity to become Australia’s prime minister. Perhaps he will have an opportunity to serve Australia in some other capacity in the future.</para>
<para>At the time of Kim Beazley Senior’s death in October, former Prime Minister John Howard, who knew Kim Beazley well, highlighted his enormous respect for Kim’s great debating skills and his innate courtesy to the Australian people. John Howard, of course, overlapped with Kim Beazley—I think John’s first three years were Kim’s last three years—and he noted what many understood then and understand now, that he was one of our great parliamentarians. He was also a great Australian, and, in my view, in honour of him we should all endeavour to conduct ourselves in our public lives in such a fashion as to ensure that the Commonwealth parliament continues to attract men and women of his great character.</para>
<para>To his wife, Betty, and to Kim, Merrilyn and their families the opposition places on record its appreciation of Kim’s long and meritorious public service and tenders its profound sympathy to them in their bereavement. We join with Senator Evans in also offering our condolences for the sad loss of David Beazley last year.</para>

<para>—When Kim Edward Beazley was elected to represent the Labor Party for the seat of Fremantle in 1945, succeeding John Curtin, he was 27 years old and the youngest member of the House of Representatives. When he retired in 1977, he was the longest serving member—from ‘student prince’, as he was once nicknamed, to the ‘father of the House’. But not all the parliamentary records Kim Beazley could claim were so enviable. As the Leader of the Opposition has said, of the 32 years Kim Beazley Sr spent in the parliament, 25 of them were in opposition. And they were all as a member for a Western Australian electorate. Every parliamentarian understands the pressure that distance and travel place on family life. For our colleagues from Western Australia those difficulties are proportionally greater.</para>
</talk.start>
<para>Beazley wrote in his memoir that neither he nor his wife, Betty, had any idea at the beginning of his career how difficult it would be to combine family life with the demands of a political career. It was especially difficult in Beazley’s early years in parliament when the frugal Labor Prime Minister Ben Chifley restricted parliamentarians’ travel. Ironically, it was not until Labor lost government that Kim Beazley had access to improved parliamentary perks, as the newly elected Liberal government expected parliamentarians to have allowances and travel more in line with businessmen’s expense accounts than Chif’s more parsimonious standards. I am sure that Kim Beazley would have traded those perks any day for a return to office. But it would be 23 years before he would have the chance.</para>
<para>Nearly three decades in opposition indicates a certain undeniable endurance. It is a measure of not only Kim Edward Beazley’s endurance, but also his consistency that when he finally took his place on the government benches it was to introduce reforms addressing the issue that had first prompted his political involvement.</para>
<para>Like many Labor figures—like me, for example—Beazley’s path through tertiary education was made possible by his employment as a teacher. Even without the burden of fees at the University of Western Australia, the cost of books and other expenses were beyond the means of a young man from a battling family during the Depression. Beazley took a monitorship at a state school and then a course at teachers training school; he was paid £60 in return for a commitment to teach for five years. He discovered that he loved teaching.</para>
<para>There are those in political life who have always aimed to become reformers, whose ambition for social change has guided all their choices. And there are those whose political career emerges, almost taking them unaware, from a deep and genuine commitment to an issue dear to them. Kim Beazley Sr was one of the latter.</para>
<para>His own experience, from a boy standing in the back row, as the Leader of the Government has said, for the royal visit with the other children whose parents could not afford shoes, to the future unlocked for him at Perth Modern School, to teaching in the state school system, left Beazley with a powerful understanding of the role education played in transforming lives, and an abiding conviction of the responsibility government bore in making that transforming opportunity available to all Australians.</para>
<para>Struck by the vast difference between education opportunities available in the state’s public schools and private schools, Kim Beazley joined the Australian Labor Party with the aim, he later wrote, of bringing to Australia high-quality universal education. His education in politics followed.</para>
<para>Western Australia was not immune to the thorny issue of state aid. Beazley found there was no great political will in the Western Australian Labor Party at that time to wade into the debate of funding, or lack thereof, for the Catholic school system. He came to believe that the antipathy between the government and non-government systems was the root cause of successive governments’ inability to provide high-quality universal education. It took nearly 30 years but before the end of his parliamentary career Beazley was able to say that he had overcome that obstacle and achieved the aims that first took him into politics.</para>
<para>He was a minister for only three years but in those three years he had responsibility for what became some of the Whitlam government’s most enduring and iconic reforms. As Minister for Education, Kim Beazley oversaw the ending of the funding divide that separated private and public schools and the introduction of free tertiary education. Those policy reforms changed the landscape of Australian education. Two ideas were firmly enshrined in Australia’s education policy: the principle that university access ought to depend on merit, not wealth; and the idea that the government is responsible for ensuring the quality of education for all Australian students.</para>
<para>There are a great many Australians today who have had an opportunity to make far more of their lives than they otherwise could have because of their access to education—access that they owe to the reforms introduced by education minister Kim Beazley in the Whitlam government. Beazley was so dedicated to the reforms that he worked night and day, criss-crossing the country until he collapsed from exhaustion. The legislation was introduced while he was in hospital.</para>
<para>The expansion of access to high-quality education may be the greatest of Kim Beazley’s legacies but it was neither the only cause he championed nor the only success he had. He held strong opinions about the direction of the Labor Party, opinions that placed him at odds with his own party branch in Western Australia. Although not a Catholic and never a Grouper he had a deep antipathy to the atheist convictions of the Communist Party and a belief that the tragedies of the world were due to mankind ignoring the tenets of religion.</para>
<para>He did not leave the Labor Party during the split but, as for so many members of the Labor Party in that era, the split had a long-lasting effect on Kim Beazley’s career, as it did on the fortunes of the Labor Party. Beazley lost his membership of the federal executive for defying the left-wing state secretary, Joe Chamberlain, by voting to support Gough Whitlam’s intervention into the unelectable Victorian branch and voting against intervention into the right-dominated New South Wales branch. He paid and was willing to pay a personal price to support Whitlam’s leadership and his very necessary party reforms, without which there would not have been a Whitlam government.</para>
<para>In other ways I think his views could be described as to the left of the party. His experience in 1961 as a member of the Select Committee on the Voting Rights for Aborigines, which travelled 21,000 miles to hold hearings all around the country, had a profound impact on Beazley’s views. He became a long-time supporter of the rights of Australia’s first inhabitants, championing the principle of what was then termed ‘tribal title’ but what we now know as land rights. He argued for government recognition that Indigenous people had a relationship to the land that was different to but not lesser than the European model. He also understood that economic security was a fundamental right for all Australians, and that for Indigenous Australians economic security had to start with title to their land.</para>
<para>He believed in listening to Indigenous communities, not to officials and welfare officers, and it was from listening to and talking with Indigenous Australians that he developed his views. He was resistant both to assimilationist insistence that Indigenous Australians completely surrender their heritage and to the brand of noble-savage racism that sought to impose unwanted paralysis and stagnation.</para>
<para>The ability to meet his fellow men as equals regardless of race or nation influenced his views on foreign policy. Beazley was able to see Australia in the context of our region without the fear of Asia that poisoned so many of his contemporaries. When it came to national security, international relations and the rights of the original inhabitants of Australia, his views would not be shared by the majority until long after his retirement from parliament. In these respects he was ahead of his time. There is a certain irony that the internationalism and antiracism that informed these views grew from the deep and abiding religious convictions and advocacy of moral rearmament that led many to characterise him as behind the times.</para>
<para>It is often said of Kim Edward Beazley that he might well have led Labor were it not for the enemies he made through his devout faith and moral rearmament convictions. I think this is perhaps a little simplistic. His views were strongly and sincerely held, were always rooted in conviction, and were without desire for personal or political gain. However, they were, in many cases, not the views of the Australian Labor Party or the Australian people.</para>
<para>On matters that are traditionally regarded as questions of conscience—such as the availability of divorce—Kim Beazley was, even in the days of the Whitlam government, part of a minority fighting to hold back a tide of change. His declaration that he had made a decision to ‘concern myself daily with the challenge of how to live out God’s will and to turn the searchlight of absolute honesty on my motives’ was viewed with consternation by some political colleagues. Nor was his enthusiastic evangelising on questions of personal morality welcome in all quarters. Although some of his views may seem alienating to us, the sincere impulses from which they sprang, I think, can only be viewed as admirable.</para>
<para>Kim Beazley Senior’s childhood was marred by the poverty and fear that followed his father’s struggles with alcohol. In his unpublished memoir he recounts going around the house hiding all the razors, believing his father might even use them on his family. At the same time his mother, a bastion of love and security for Kim and his six older siblings, emphasised the importance of education and of religion—education as the escape from poverty and insecurity, and religion as the guide to a decent and moral life. Throughout his life, Kim Edward Beazley would continue to be guided by these values.</para>
<para>His lifelong determination, expressed in political activism and religious faith, was to be a good husband, a good father and a good man. At his funeral, his family testified movingly how well he lived up to the first two of those ambitions. Speaking as a member of the Australian Labor Party, to which Kim Edward Beazley gave so many decades of service and in whose name he achieved so much on behalf of the disadvantaged, the marginalised and the embattled in our community, I believe it is undeniable that he achieved the third as well. Knowing Kim Edward Beazley’s son Kim Christian Beazley so well, we of course feel this loss very keenly. Our sympathies are with Betty Beazley and all the Beazley family. We have lost a colleague. They have lost a dearly beloved husband, father and friend.</para>

<para>—It was quite a moving funeral service for Kim Beazley, and I thought it was a testament to him that six former Labor leaders attended. I do not think I have seen a bigger gathering of former Labor leaders. I express from the Labor Party’s point of view, too, our appreciation to the many Liberal members of parliament who attended the funeral, right in the middle of a vigorous election campaign. It was a great tribute you gave him to turn up and to see him off in the way you did.</para>
</talk.start>
<para>At the funeral my memory went back to 1966, to a lounge room in East Bentley. The Henty Young Labor Association had as a guest speaker that night Kim Beazley. He was the first federal politician I had ever met. He came along and gave up the whole night to address just 15 members, and he was inspiring. I probably would not say that I share a lot of things in common with him in terms of religion and other things but, as a young 18-year-old, I found him absolutely inspiring as a federal member of parliament. We all used to listen to parliament in those days, so every time I knew he was due to speak we would always listen to parliament to hear him.</para>
<para>Mention has been made today of Kim Beazley’s contribution in the education area, but I think one point has been overlooked. It was not so much his passion for kids and what he did for them: his activities helped mark the end of sectarianism in this country as we knew it. This country, up until 1970, had a great sectarian divide between Catholics and Protestants. The police forces were divided. Political parties were divided on these lines. Indeed, on occasions even our national cricket side divided on these lines. His great contribution—and he was not alone in it; he had friends on the other side of the House who contributed—was that around 1970 to 1972, almost overnight, sectarianism disappeared in this country. We are a much greater country for it, and Kim Beazley contributed enormously to that.</para>
<para>Not many people in Australian politics have been successful in politics when they have succeeded a prime minister in their seat. If you look back at all those individuals who have inherited or taken over a seat from a prime minister, you see that very few have succeeded. You might argue that Andrew Peacock did in Menzies. You can argue, certainly, for Kim Beazley. But for most people the anticipation is just too great and they never amount to having the sort of career their predecessor had. Several people have talked today about how soul destroying it must have been for him to be in opposition so long, but I have to say that that was the norm at the time. If you were a Tasmanian Liberal, you would have been in opposition for 33 years, from 1935 to 1968, as you would have been if you were a Liberal member in New South Wales from 1941 to 1965 or a Labor member in Victoria from 1955 to 1982. And imagine being a Liberal or a Country Party member in Queensland where you were only in power for 2½ years out of 42. So it was quite a common thing in Australian history. But at least you did not have to travel every week or every second week from Western Australia to the national capital.</para>
<para>Kim Beazley was one of five members of the House of Representatives on the Labor side who saw out the entire time, from 1949 to 1972. Arthur Calwell saw out the 23 years of opposition. Charlie Griffiths did so and made, I think, six speeches in that entire 23 years. There were also Clyde Cameron and Fred Daly. So five of them spent the 23 years in opposition. I look at the two Liberals opposite who spent 13 years in opposition here. You know how long it is, and we have just spent 11½ years. Imagine almost doubling that, being in opposition for that long and having the persistence to stay involved—an absolutely remarkable quality, I think.</para>
<para>John Faulkner alluded to it but did not really expand on a much tougher thing that Kim Beazley had to do. Kim Beazley was an outsider. He was an outsider in his own state branch and for several years never knew, from day to day, week to week, whether he would be expelled. That is a very hard political life, when you keep your faith, when you keep your principles. They were at odds. And this was in an era when, in Western Australia and Victoria, the democratic centralism was only excelled by the politburo in Moscow—nowhere else. This was a time when there was no tolerance of another point of view, and no real will to win. That is where the modern Labor Party at least has changed and is different. And he had to live through the frustration of that, knowing that he was not appreciated by his own state branch and, quite often, by his own federal caucus. Yet he overcame all that—odds that would have daunted most of us and  led us to give it away. So he lived his life very much as the outsider.</para>
<para>It is also true to say that his biggest disappointment in politics came late in his political life. He bore a great shame about the Iraqi loans affair in 1976, and so he should have. It was the lowest moment in the history of the Australian Labor Party—a matter that I am still ashamed about. But you learn from those mistakes; you do not give up. But it was a horrendous moment for him. He resigned from the front bench and left politics a year and a half later, in 1977. I am sorry he went out that way, but he did not, of course, just say, ‘Well, that’s it.’ He went on to give meritorious service in education inquiries and, as the leader has referred to, the inquiry into parliamentary privilege in Western Australia. He went on to be a constructive citizen for the rest of his life.</para>
<para>Of course, we know him partly from knowing him and partly through the prism of his son, someone I admire immensely. It was a very tough time for Kim Beazley Jr. As those who were at the funeral know, he spoke magnificently about his father, something that must have been very difficult for him to do. So could I pass on my condolences to his family and his friends and, again, thank all those who made the effort in the middle of an election campaign to attend his funeral.</para>

<para>—I join in the condolence motion on behalf of the Australian Democrats and offer my condolences on the sad passing of Kim Edward Beazley on 12 October 2007. We were represented at his funeral by my colleague Senator Andrew Murray. I also want to express my most sincere sympathy to his family—to his wife, Betty, and to his children, including Kim Beazley Jr.</para>
</talk.start>
<para>Kim Beazley Sr had a long and distinguished record within the parliament. He was described as a political giant, as a student prince, even, in some of the clippings I have seen. He was intelligent and passionate, but he was also a moderate and a reasonable man and a great orator. At 27 he was the youngest person to enter the House of Representatives and he went on to become one of parliament’s longest serving members, lasting 32 years. In that time he made an enormous contribution, one which he continued after leaving politics.</para>
<para>Kim Beazley Sr was education minister in the Whitlam government from 1972 to 1975. I must say that I owe him a debt of gratitude because, when he was education minister, the government abolished university fees due to his initiative, as I understand it, and I was the beneficiary of that—as, I suspect, were many now in this place. On taking office, one of his first initiatives was to arrange for Aboriginal children to be taught in their own language, with English as a second language. This was a very farsighted initiative on his part. By the time Kim Beazley left the ministry, Aboriginal children were being taught in 22 of their own languages. I think it is a great pity that we do not now see very many schools offering Indigenous languages. Educationists know that it is preferable for children who come to school without English to be able to start in their own language. I think it is also a great pity that so many Indigenous languages around the country have been lost. Very few have in fact been recorded and are used, except perhaps in the Northern Territory.</para>
<para>He also introduced needs based funding for all schools through his Schools Commission, and that started funding for non-government schools in the interests of greater equality. He had a great affinity for Indigenous Australians and in 1952 he made the first speech on Aboriginal reconciliation. He would no doubt have been very proud of the welcome to country ceremony which took place this morning before the opening of parliament.</para>
<para>He was awarded an AO in 1979 and I think that he will be remembered very well in this parliament and at large for his many contributions to this country. I want to finish with one quote from him: ‘If you can read and write, your future is in your own hands.’ I think that is very good advice indeed. We should be very grateful to the Hon. Kim Edward Beazley for his contribution to education in this country.</para>

<motion>
<para>That the Senate records its deep regret at the death, on 3 November 2007, of Peter James Andren, former member for Calare, and places on record its appreciation of his long and meritorious public service and tenders its profound sympathy to his family in their bereavement.</para>
</motion>
<para class="block">I thank the Senate. I note, as is so appropriate, that as I rise here the Prime Minister is speaking about the magnificent contribution to parliamentary life that Peter Andren made in the House of Representatives. Last year, when he knew that he was terminally ill, Peter Andren said, ‘I look back on the last 11½ years with great pride, having forever silenced the sceptics who say an Independent is wasted space within the political system.’ That pride was warranted.</para>
<para>Peter was a son of Gulargambone, a much-loved independent member for Calare and one extraordinarily good Australian. To quote his fellow independent, Tony Windsor:</para>
<quote>
<para class="block">He never took a backward step when it came to representing the people of Calare and, more broadly, country Australians.</para>
</quote>
<para class="block">Peter Andren was also described as the conscience of Australia’s parliament. He put himself to the people of Lithgow, Bathurst, Orange and all the rest of Calare and, when they said yes, he turned out to be an outstanding representative for them and for the country. At each election since, he won by a bigger margin. That is not because Peter followed opinion polls. Rather, he was a leader who knew the thinking of his constituents. He worked hard for Calare, disproving the notion that, if you are not in government, you languish. As Prime Minister Rudd said in the House, Peter Andren gave the instruction to his staff that, when members of his electorate phoned the office, that call was to be treated as the most important thing going on in that person’s life on that day.</para>
<para>In his first speech to the House in 1996, Peter outlined his independent viewpient as follows:</para>
<quote>
<para class="block">There is a growing awareness in the electorate that honest, effective representation of constituents’ interests can be achieved through channels other than political parties. Inflexible ideology on either side will bring swift retribution. People want fair and reasonable government, no domination by one school of thought whether it be union or rationalist economics.</para>
</quote>
<para class="block">In a note to me in 2003, Peter Andren spoke about ‘grit, determination and ethic’, which are three words that fit his politics like a glove. His ethics were shown in his stand for Aboriginal Australians. His grit was shown in his insistence that the <inline font-style="italic">Tampa</inline> refugees be treated with decency. His determination was shown by his attempts to get better transport, telecommunications and other essential services for his people of Calare. He saw the sale of Telstra as economic rationalism, serving the interests of the big end of town rather than those of the people of Millthorpe, Trunkey Creek or Molong.</para>
<para>Peter took on the systematic abuse of parliamentary travel allowances. He said:</para>
<quote>
<para class="block">Here is a golden opportunity to lift the standards, and I am sure the Prime Minister—</para>
</quote>
<para class="block">he was referring to Prime Minister Howard—</para>
<quote>
<para class="block">will address it.</para>
</quote>
<para class="block">After hurling a few disgruntled words at the member for Calare, Prime Minister Howard did lift the standards. It was over this issue that Peter said he got his dander up, so he stood up again and objected. But instead of listening, the Speaker had Peter ejected. Peter said, ‘That was probably one of the silliest things the Prime Minister has done in question time since I have been here because it focused attention on the issue and I got calls from all over Australia.’ Tandberg drew the famous cartoon of Peter Andren being booted out of the House, showing it to the Australian people gathered outside. The cartoon carried the words:</para>
<quote>
<para class="block">The cheek of him! Coming in here representing the mob.</para>
</quote>
<para class="block">Peter enjoyed his political life, but he spurned the blatant self-interest of politicians’ superannuation and pay rises, which are so often a matter of public opprobrium. He wanted hard-working MPs to have a fair reward, but he was the voice for all Australians in insisting that the 69 per cent top-up of MPs superannuation be brought back to nine per cent, which was what all other citizens could expect.</para>
<para>What is not well known is that Peter never took up the $15,000 of overseas travel that he was entitled to each time he was re-elected. Nor did he take the $180, or thereabouts, per night in travel allowance when out of his electorate, because he saw the $39,000 per annum electoral allowance as generous enough. Who of us knows anybody else in this parliament who has that attitude?</para>
<para>He gave politics a good name indeed. In an article she wrote in the <inline font-style="italic">Bulletin</inline>, the then columnist, Maxine McKew, who replaced Prime Minister Howard as the member for Bennelong, observed:</para>
<quote>
<para class="block">He certainly makes a three-hour drive from Sydney to his electoral office in Bathurst more than worth while. It is hard to think of another politician who is so waffle free. Andren indicates nothing. He gives you the facts and tells you what he thinks.</para>
</quote>
<para class="block">Peter campaigned for better rural health services. He argued:</para>
<quote>
<para class="block">Communities without a doctor want to know why taxpayer-trained doctors can’t be required to work for a period in the country in return for taxpayer-funded Medicare provider privileges. Globalisation, competition policy and government hands-off markets may work well at the top end of town, but can have devastating effects on rural and regional areas.</para>
</quote>
<para class="block">He spoke out for a free East Timor during all those years in which the major parties—no matter who was in government or in opposition—endorsed Indonesia’s military occupation. And time has proved him right of course. Peter said, ‘I might only be a pinprick on an elephant hide, but I can raise matters at national level.’ People told him, ‘You stick your neck out. We don’t always agree with you, Peter, but we know you are not being driven by other forces.’ That is so true.</para>
<para>His driving force was the people of Calare, their children and their grandchildren, and this nation of Australia. His decency was noted across the political spectrum and throughout the press gallery, which was stunned and saddened by the news of his illness in the middle of last year. An editorial in the <inline font-style="italic">Daily Telegraph</inline> put it:</para>
<quote>
<para class="block">They say in politics we get the MPs we deserve—which would suggest the people of Calare are possessed of exceptional character and decency.</para>
</quote>
<para class="block">Peter Andren ended his first speech here in Canberra by saying:</para>
<quote>
<para class="block">To my father and mother, both deceased, thanks for the strength and guidance—</para>
</quote>
<para class="block">On behalf of his admiring colleagues and all the Australians in the future who ever put up their hands for high office and, seeking a lead, read about his contribution to national life, Peter Andren, now that you are deceased, to you we can say, ‘Thank you for your strength and your guidance.’</para>
<para>On a personal note, I will never forget Peter coming with his partner, Valerie Faber, to walk in Tasmania’s giant forests, which were and are threatened needlessly by woodchipping and now by the Gunns pulp mill. In fact, after that visit, the two of them held a magnificant fundraising dinner in Orange in the mists on Mount Canobolas to help save the forests of Tasmania so far away. In the Styx Valley, which is a living wonder of the world, we talked about how much we human beings rely on nature for the air we breathe, for the food we eat, for the medicines that give us aid and for the inspiration that wild nature brings to every heart. This notable member of parliament went out of his way for those forests, as he did for the people of his beloved Calare. Like the great eagles of the forest, Peter Andren’s integrity, his example, and his impact on Australian affairs will forever soar high in this nation’s political history.</para>

</talker>
<para>—Before I start, I would just like to put on record how deeply moved I have been listening to the condolence comments in the chamber this afternoon. They have been particularly moving and give great dignity to the people about whom they were created.</para>
</talk.start>
<para>I want to talk about one of the icons of Australian entertainment, and that is Margret Roadknight. I want to stress at this point that her name is Margret, as she says when she gives her unique performances: M-a-r-g-r-e-t Roadknight. Last Saturday evening I was very privileged be able to attend a concert in Brisbane which was sponsored by the Brisbane Labour History Association with the help of the wonderful Woodford Folk Festival people and also sponsored by the Queensland Council of Unions. That particular concert was put on to celebrate songs of protest. It went by the astounding name of <inline font-style="italic">Rekindle the Flames of Discontent</inline>. Who better to be one of the headline acts at that particular function than Margret Roadknight?</para>
<para>During 2007 Ms Roadknight celebrated 44 years of performance across the world. Not just in Australia, but most particularly representing Australia across the world. You can see by looking at her performance history that she has worked on all continents. She has brought her unique style and also her passion for community, her passion for social justice and, most importantly, her passion for engaging the community with her skill. She has brought that to people across the globe, and done us proud as Australians as she has been there, so often, representing Australia.</para>
<para>I will quote from one of Margret Roadknight’s many reviews, and I do encourage people who may be listening to follow up some of the reviews that Margret has received in the last 44 years of performance. Margret has travelled to America many times because of the linkages with the folk and the music scene there. This was quoted in the <inline font-style="italic">Oakland Tribune</inline> in San Francisco:</para>
<quote>
<para class="block">... as much as for her impressive voice and choice of songs, Roadknight is delightful because she sheds so much fresh light on the nature of the world and its people.</para>
</quote>
<para class="block">This is her gift. She enjoys the world, she learns from her community and then she takes her special gift, her craft, her musicality and her wonderful voice to engage all of us.</para>
<para>Margret has been known most commonly for her love of social justice. When you look at her biography, you see that she has taken song to engage all of us in so many issues of social justice. While she is performing, she consistently tells stories to the audience—not just in her performance, but in anecdotes, sharing over those many years of performance and over 35 recordings. She laughingly says that her career spans the history of recording. She holds up LPs and then looks at video disks and DVDs. That shows that she has gone through most of the recent years of seeing how this industry developed.</para>
<para>In that time, she has taken her gift to look at what has been happening in our world. When performing, she often talks about one of her favourite experiences—one which we can share, because it is about the issue of peace. She has been a genuine peace activist for all of her life, not just in her recording period. She talks with great pride and humour about when she was privileged to play at a United Nations event in 1982 talking about nuclear war and disarmament. That is a continuing argument that we have in our world. Margret talks about performing in front of the world audience and doing her particular interpretation of that wonderful song, <inline font-style="italic">Imagine</inline>. Anyone who has been privileged to hear Margret Roadknight perform <inline font-style="italic">Imagine</inline> will not forget that experience.</para>
<para>As Margret performs, she engages with the audience and encourages all of us to use our voices because she says that voice is our tool; voice is communication. She says with authority that, towards the end of her performance before this massive audience, the electronic digital machinery around the top of the area began, without warning, to pick up the words of <inline font-style="italic">Imagine</inline>. So as her voice was ringing across the square, with thousands of people there and an international audience, as she was singing about peace, imagining a world with peace and crying for a world where we can make peace, across the area which shows the international news and also the Wall Street figures, the words of <inline font-style="italic">Imagine</inline> were being printed. She stood alone with her guitar and her voice and the world heard this message. She states that the world must continue to hear this message because we still have not attained peace. But Margret Roadknight will continue in the battle to ensure that we can.</para>
<para>Ms Roadknight also has the gift of engaging and teaching all of us to use our voices, because she is committed to see that the world can sing. Over these many years, she has always had voice workshops where she challenges all of us to use our own voices and she says quite rightly, ‘When you are happy sing; when you are sad sing louder.’ She says that is the way to perform and to make our lives better.</para>
<para>I am particularly keen to talk about Margret in this place tonight because over 20 years ago when this building was being created Margret was actually part of the Deep Bells Ring touring program, which she helped to develop, in which she and others travelled around work sites and talked to workers and people who were gathered around work sites and engaged them with the power of voice and the power of linking voice with getting across your message. I was speaking with Senator Lundy the other day and she was at the Parliament House work site when Deep Bells Ring headlined by Margret Roadknight was performed. I ask all of you who are here to think about how that message—with the workers gathered, talking about the songs of workers, the songs of construction—took a moment in the creation of this building. Now we are, more than 20 years later, talking about a major celebration of this wonderful building. I hope that, when we are actually celebrating 20 years of our Parliament House, we will be able to have Margret Roadknight’s voice again in this area, speaking about how with our voices we can share and make a difference to our world.</para>
<para>Margret speaks often about her travels and about the wonderful experience you can have travelling through other lands, learning their instruments, learning their music and sharing. For those of us who know Margret, she says that she ‘does not blend in easily’. She is a woman who I think claims a height of six foot five or more and she talks about travelling through China in the 1970s and 1980s. That image brings to mind a particular, classic image of a very tall and impressive European woman working with many of the Chinese people. She did stand out, but she was welcomed and loved and she still in performances today recounts some experiences and some of the beautiful melodies that she learnt from the Chinese people which she integrates into performance now. Margret learns from other communities. She engages with and enjoys their music. She then gives that the Roadknight touch, and that splendid voice, which is distinctive and extremely impressive, gives us the chance to learn so much about so many other cultures and ways of performing.</para>
<para>Margret is not a songwriter; she consistently says that she does not write songs. She gathers songs from other people and then presents them in her own way. It can be Chinese folk music, Israeli dance music, or the magical rhythms of South America or South Africa. I think some of my favourites of hers are from Australian songwriters. As a young woman, I remember going to folk festivals and hearing her particular version of <inline font-style="italic">Girls in Our Town</inline> and its message stays in my mind about the hope and the hopelessness of young women growing up in country towns. I also think she has a particular relationship with the music of Ted Egan. Some of her music celebrating women as pioneers have become anthems for women in our country and others. I want to give great praise to Margret Roadknight for her skill, for her passion, for her social activism and for all the entertainment and enjoyment she has given me and so many others. We remember her message: ‘When you are happy sing; when you are sad sing louder.’</para>

</talker>
<para>—Tonight I stand to speak on my view that the Rudd Labor government should be condemned for the loss of 150 Centrelink call centre jobs in Launceston, which was announced today. I am calling, on behalf of the Tasmanian Liberal Senate team, on the Rudd Labor government to reverse this decision. I am calling on the Tasmanian federal Labor senators in this place to stand up and state their position either in support of this decision or in support of the people of Launceston and the people of Tasmania who are going to have their jobs axed.</para>
</talk.start>
<para>I highlight the point that the new federal Labor member for Bass, Jodie Campbell, has failed in her first major test. I also wish to speak to the issues of the Ouse and Rosebery hospitals and to the communities of the west coast of Tasmania and the central highlands districts who have been gutted by the withdrawal of the $1 million that was not only promised but paid to those communities to upgrade and support those local hospitals. I highlight also the concerns I have for the Launceston General Hospital in particular, about the promises made, commitments given and plans that are now being sketched and prepared as a result of those commitments to the Launceston General Hospital.</para>
<para>But firstly, to the cruel hoax that has been perpetrated on Launceston working families. I am personally disgusted that the Rudd Labor government today had Centrelink do its dirty work by confirming the job cuts, in a feeble attempt to protect the federal member for Bass. Before parliament had even started for the year, this Labor government was already politicising and manipulating government agencies. Centrelink has confirmed today that up until this week it was ‘in the middle of a recruitment process for those 150 jobs’. Those jobs were announced by the Prime Minister last year on 13 July, well and truly before the election was called. He said on that day:</para>
<quote>
<para class="block">I am pleased to announce that the Australian Government will expand its Centrelink staffing numbers in its Launceston call centre operation by an estimated 150 full time equivalent employees. ...</para>
<para class="block">While selection for these positions will be subject to the usual Australian Public Service recruitment process and based on merit, given the skills and experience of the Telstra employees, I expect that a large number of these people will be successful in gaining positions in Centrelink.</para>
<para class="block">The agreement to expand the Centrelink call centre network will importantly keep these skilled jobs in the region.</para>
</quote>
<para class="block">The former Prime Minister noted that:</para>
<quote>
<para class="block">This expansion comes on top of an announcement earlier this year to expand Centrelink’s Port Macquarie Call Centre ... and call centres in Hobart and Coffs Harbour by 125 employees in mid-2008.</para>
</quote>
<para class="block">Of course, we found out today that the 125 extra jobs for Glenorchy, in Hobart, are also being axed. I am very upset about this on behalf of the Tasmanian Liberal Senate team and on behalf of the local community where I live in Launceston. People have been very concerned for over a week. The concern is that the federal Labor member has done nothing. What has she done? She has failed in her first major test as the member for Bass by emerging empty-handed on Monday from a meeting with the Minister for Human Services, Senator Joe Ludwig, where she sought assurances about the jobs. The concerns were first brought to light over a week ago on 5 February, when I was tipped off about those concerns, and I expressed concern that the Howard government’s pledge of 150 more jobs at the Centrelink call centre in Launceston would fall victim to the Rudd Labor government’s budget razor gang. That is what I said in the media. It is on the public record. So you would think that the local federal member would make inquiries and that local federal Labor senators would also make inquiries and stand up for their communities and for those jobs. They have not done so and they have failed.</para>
<para>So tonight I ask federal Labor senators Nick Sherry, Carol Brown, Kerry O’Brien, who lives in Launceston, and Senator Helen Polley, who lives in Launceston: what is your position? Will they state their views as to whether they support these 150 jobs being cut in Launceston? In doing so, I highlight the fact that the Premier of Tasmania today has put out a statement headed ‘Disappointment at Centrelink call centre decision’, saying he has:</para>
<quote>
<para class="block">...  written to the Prime Minister voicing the State Government’s extreme disappointment at confirmation that the 150-seat Centrelink call centre proposed for Launceston will not go ahead.</para>
</quote>
<para>               …              …              …</para>
<quote>
<para>Now, less than three months on, the Rudd Government gives the people of Northern Tasmania every reason to feel their votes have been taken for granted.</para>
<para>It is extremely disappointing that the new government has chosen not to honour this important commitment; to renege on a promise to save 150 call centre jobs in Launceston.</para>
</quote>
<para class="block">This the Labor Premier of Tasmania. The statement continues:</para>
<quote>
<para>Mr Lennon said the decision was especially harsh given that federal Labor gave every appearance of supporting the Centrelink jobs when announced by John Howard well before caretaker conventions were triggered.</para>
<para>He said the enviable reputation of the Launceston call centre and its workers, combined with a projected federal budget surplus of more than $14 billion in 2007-08, made the decision even harder to fathom.</para>
</quote>
<para>        …             …             …</para>
<quote>
<para>Sacrificing this investment in the name of cost-cutting is a bitter pill for the North.</para>
</quote>
<para class="block">Goodness me! What more do you need, federal Labor senators? What more do you need, federal Labor member for Bass, than to get that message from your premier? The deputy leader of the Liberals in Tasmania, Jeremy Rockliff, was onto this about a week ago, highlighting his concerns. I congratulate the Tasmanian state Liberals for standing up for their communities. Well done, Will Hodgman, Jeremy Rockliff, Peter Gutwein and Sue Napier, for standing up for your communities—unlike their state colleagues. I commend Michelle O’Byrne, the state member for Bass, for expressing—I will not say in a feeble way—in a moderate way her concerns about the fact that the federal Labor government should abide by this decision and not axe these jobs.</para>
<para>Ms Campbell has claimed that the Centrelink jobs were unfunded. This is wrong. Mr Tanner, in his media release of 6 February, pointed to the $5.1 million in savings. I have the document here. This is a federal Labor  government document. It says:</para>
<quote>
<para class="block">Reversal of measure—Centrelink—further call centre supplementation.</para>
</quote>
<para class="block">They have reversed the decision—the money was committed, the decision was made, the promise was given, commitments were made, interviews were had, and so on, but they have reversed the decision and are not now going ahead with that. I asked the federal member for Bass: when did you first learn of this decision? Was it in the meeting with Senator Joe Ludwig or was it before then? Why did she remain silent for six days after federal minister Lindsay Tanner announced, on 6 February this year, the government’s intention to axe the funding? I feel for the families of those Telstra call centre workers who banked on Jodie Campbell and banked on a job with Centrelink based on John Howard’s announcement eight months ago. I note that Jodie Campbell has made a statement today attacking me and also attacking the former member for Bass, Michael Ferguson, who fought so hard to get these jobs and was successful in his efforts. I congratulate him and thank him for standing up for Bass and for trying to make Bass strong again. The federal member, Jodie Campbell, has attacked me personally and Michael Ferguson in a statement today, saying that the promise was never specifically funded. That is clearly wrong.</para>
<para>In conclusion, I want to make it clear that I have spoken to a number of people in the community today who are very upset. I have spoken to Damon Thomas, from the Tasmanian Chamber of Commerce and Industry, and I have got a call in to the local mayor, Albert Van Zetten. A lot of other local people are very upset and concerned about the 150 jobs that are going to be axed. What are the implications? I ask for this government to reverse that decision and to change its view. I empathise with the people of the west coast and thank the west coast mayor, Darryl Gerrity, for fighting so hard for his local community. I thank the Rosebery hospital action group for fighting so hard for their community and to upgrade their hospital. I also want to thank Mayor Deirdre Flint and the Ouse hospital action group for their efforts to save the $1 million that was promised and delivered to them last year by the Howard government that has now been taken back by the federal Labor government. I acknowledge their work. I say thank you to them on behalf of their local communities for standing up. With support, with effort and with their local communities, we can do that.</para>
<para>Finally, I say that there are concerns regarding the Launceston General Hospital. Money has been committed and decisions have been made. In fact, it is a huge amount of money that has been committed to the Launceston General Hospital—millions of dollars for a cardiac unit, $8 million for patient transport services along the north-west coast and further millions of dollars. It is a serious concern and I draw that to the attention of the Senate, the Labor government and those Labor senators in this place. I ask them to please reverse this decision for the sake of Tasmania.</para>

<para>—Tonight I want to speak about the important social inclusion agenda that is part of the new Labor government. I want to remind people of something that Hugh Mackay wrote not too long ago:</para>
</talk.start>
<quote>
<para class="block">In the past few years, many Australians have simply lost interest in the political process. Their response to their sense of powerlessness was not to take to the streets in angry demonstrations, but to turn away from the issues of the day and take refuge in their own local, immediate, personal concerns.</para>
</quote>
<para class="block">He wrote:</para>
<quote>
<para class="block">As a nation, we took our eye off the big picture; our focus turned inward; we became self-absorbed.</para>
</quote>
<para class="block">A few things have happened since Hugh Mackay wrote that, most importantly the election of the Labor government on 24 November last year. In the Governor-General’s speech today he gave impetus to the social inclusion agenda of the Rudd government and tonight, as the Parliamentary Secretary for Social Inclusion and the Voluntary Sector, I want to elaborate a little bit on that agenda and what it really means for people who are suffering from entrenched disadvantage in Australia.</para>
<para>A social inclusion agenda is about making a tangible difference to people who face barriers to participation in aspects of Australian life that most of us take for granted. That is about work or education, but it is also about engagement with family and friends and the local and broader communities. Social inclusion recognises that there are complex reasons that prevent people from participating. These might be poverty, education and literacy, access to transport and housing, disability, drug and alcohol problems, chronic ill health or mental illness. It may be the circumstances of older Australians, people living in rural, remote or even growing regions or those who have recently come to Australia. All of them face particular barriers to participation in work and in their communities. Our national social inclusion strategy is about finding innovative ways to remove barriers to participation in the nation’s social, economic and civic life, as one means to address entrenched and localised disadvantage in Australia.</para>
<para>We have heard a lot in recent years about the term ‘whole of government’. It has become a commonplace term. It is thrown around all the time in public policy, but what it means in the social inclusion context is both common sense and radical. It is about realising that people’s lives are not easily segmented by government department. Social inclusion demands a whole-of-government strategy because the people who face the most significant barriers to participation in our society do not fit neatly into a category. The barriers that they face fall within the jurisdiction of more than one department, and of course they are interconnected. They affect each other and how any one person might access the services they need to find a path out of disadvantage.</para>
<para>Social inclusion is about realising that, if we want to make our country a fair place to live and for everyone to have an opportunity to live a happy and fulfilling life, we need to look at wider issues than just poverty. What better example do we have than what we heard about Kim Beazley Sr in the condolence debate this afternoon. He was propagating this agenda all those years ago. This is a burning issue—it is alive for the Labor Party; it is certainly alive for the Labor government—and it is one that I hope to champion throughout my career as parliamentary secretary.</para>
<para>But there are other people who are championing such an approach. An extraordinary thing happened that really takes us back to Hugh Mackay’s comments about people waking up, engaging again in the big picture and focusing much more on the kind of country that they want Australia to be. That occurred last year in a campaign that was run by GetUp! Action for Australia. It developed a ‘People’s agenda for the new parliament’, and what great hope we as a Labor government provide to the 32,500 people who participated in this extraordinary and unprecedented exercise in real democracy on Tuesday, 11 December last year. Thousands of people met all around Australia in informal gatherings—‘vision get-togethers’, they were called. People who shared a postcode met at their local club or in lounge rooms around the country to decide their priorities for the recently elected parliament, and they have come up with some extraordinary priorities.</para>
<para>Significantly, these people want the country to become environmentally sustainable and they want to combat climate change. They want the country to have high-quality primary, secondary and tertiary public education and they want us to respect the rights and improve the living standards of Indigenous Australians. Those three top priorities of the GetUp! campaign were reflected accurately in the Governor-General’s address this afternoon and have been reflected in all of the messages that the Prime Minister has given to the nation since his election.</para>
<para>In terms of the issue of social inclusion, which I am responsible for and intimately engaged with, the GetUp! campaign demanded that the national government address the issue of entrenched poverty. Their fifth priority was combating entrenched poverty and narrowing the divide between the rich and the poor. This is the very important message to this parliament from 32,500 ordinary, engaged Australians who for the last 10 years have not wanted to be part of a political process but have found a way of doing it by connecting locally in their communities:</para>
<quote>
<para class="block">We need the political will and vision to address the issue of entrenched poverty which stretches over many different issue areas, some of them covered in this Agenda. That national vision must address both the causes and the symptoms of inequality. We want affordable housing to be a focus, especially for the homeless, low-income earners and renters. A culture that enshrines human rights as a prism to view all policy areas through should begin to alleviate the conditions producing poverty and widening the gap. Access to the system must be improved for rural and Indigenous communities.</para>
</quote>
<para class="block">The message is that our social inclusion agenda has to be seen in terms of ‘the measure of the failure of our economic systems’. They also tell us:</para>
<quote>
<para class="block">Poverty is the single most preventable factor in inequities in health and access to education and living opportunities. Take care of this one and there will be a marked influence on aboriginal health, educational opportunities, social cohesion ...</para>
</quote>
<para class="block">The ‘People’s agenda’ is a stunning document that brings us back to the fundamental concerns of ordinary Australians. It takes us to the issues of Iraq. It takes us back to the issues of protecting our human rights and our civil liberties. It focuses on preventative health care. These are the big picture agenda issues that were outlined by both the Governor-General this afternoon and the Prime Minister in his addresses to the nation. And, of course, it goes to the issue of our relationship with Indigenous Australians. And what better indicator could there be than the welcome to country ceremony that marked the beginning of the 42nd Parliament and of course the sorry debate that we are going to have tomorrow.</para>
<para>I was heartened this morning at the ecumenical service that also marked the beginning of the 42nd Parliament to have proudly stood with over 100 senators and members of parliament and their families, members of the diplomatic corps, members of the Canberra community and many schoolchildren today, who have taken great hope and enthusiasm from the direction of the Rudd Labor government. I am proud to be part of it.</para>

<para>—The Minister for the Environment and Water Resources has provided the following answer to the honourable senator’s question:</para>
</talk.start>
<quote pgwide="yes">
<list type="decimal">
<item label="(1) (a)">
<para>There have been three nominations to the National Heritage List relating to the Burrup Peninsula and Dampier Archipelago. (b) The nominations are from the International Federation of Rock Art Organisations, Indigenous groups from the region, and the National Trust of Western Australia. (c) The nominations were received on 25 March 2004, 10 May 2004 and 24 May 2004, respectively.</para>
<para>I have not, nor has my Department, received a nomination for World Heritage listing. In accordance with the World Heritage Convention only the Australian Government can nominate places within its jurisdiction for inscription on the World Heritage List.</para>
</item>
<item label="(2)">
<para>Yes. A request for emergency listing of the area was received on 19 May 2004. The request was subsequently withdrawn and the matter was concluded. A second request for emergency listing was received on 12 December 2006. On 22 December 2006 this request for emergency heritage listing was declined.</para>
</item>
<item label="(3)">
<para>, (4) and (5) There are no provisions in the Environment Protection and Biodiversity Conservation Act 1999 for appeals against proposed inclusions in the National Heritage List.</para>
</item>
<item label="(6)">
<para>Yes. The Western Australian Government provided information under [then] section 324G (available on the WA Department of Industry and Resources website) and [then] 324H of the Environment Protection and Biodiversity Conservation Act 1999 in relation to the potential National Heritage List boundary and the economic and management implications if the place was included in the National Heritage List. I received correspondence from the Western Australian Deputy Premier in March and met with him on 16 April 2007 to discuss the timing of a decision on National Heritage listing and the development of Western Australian management arrangements. I also received correspondence from the Deputy Premier regarding the list on 2 July. My Department also met with officials from the Western Australian Government to discuss procedural aspects of the inclusion of the Dampier Archipelago in the National Heritage List and options for addressing the potential economic, social and management implications.</para>
</item>
<item label="(7)">
<para>In 2003 there was correspondence leading to informal discussions between officers from my Department and Western Australian Government officials about preliminary and procedural aspects of a possible World Heritage Serial Rock Art nomination. These discussions did not continue following the commencement of the National Heritage listing processes.</para>
</item>
<item label="(8)">
<para>Yes. The Department has commissioned two reports. The first report was completed in 2005 and was a desktop study of scientific values for Indigenous cultural heritage on the Burrup Peninsula and Dampier Archipelago. This report has been released to the nominators and to the persons identified under s.324G(4) of the Environment Protection and Biodiversity Conservation Act 1999 as owners and occupiers and Indigenous persons with rights and interests in the nominated area. In 2006 this report was updated, as information that could not be accessed in 2005 was subsequently made available for consideration. This second report was completed in August 2006.</para>
</item>
<item label="(9)">
<para>On 3 July 2007 I acknowledged the Dampier Archipelago and Burrup Peninsula’s outstanding heritage value to the nation by including it in the National Heritage List. I also acknowledge it has significance of an international scale.</para>

<para>—The Attorney-General has provided the following answer to the honourable senator’s question:</para>
</talk.start>
<quote pgwide="yes">
<list type="loweralpha">
<item label="(a)">
<para>The following information has been sourced from the Department of the Treasury and the Australian Institute of Criminology.</para>
<para>The taxation system applies equally to cyberspace commercial activities and conventional commercial activities.</para>
<para>Internet and related technologies do reduce the barriers to entry for certain types of commercial activities, including international transactions. In addition, these technologies can create variations on the types of challenges that occur in the taxation of conventional commerce. However, there are no challenges which are unique to cyberspace commercial activities.</para>
<para>The Australian taxation system presently addresses international transactions, including those conducted by cyberspace. Through work with international bodies the Australian Government is ensuring that there is increasing international cooperation between countries in relation to all types of international transactions.</para>
<para>The Australian Taxation Office (ATO) has an ongoing program of environmental scanning to identify developments, patterns, trends and drivers in the economy and assess these for their tax implications. As part of that program the ATO monitors developments in relation to cyberspace commercial activities and electronic commerce and the use of technology by business.</para>
<para>The ATO has also engaged the Australian Institute of Criminology (AIC) to conduct research into serious taxation fraud including the risks created by information and communications technologies. The results of this research are expected in late 2007.</para>
<para>In relation to the challenges posed by cyberspace commercial activities, the ATO first published an internationally recognised report in 1997 and continues to apply the tax laws to cyberspace commercial activity in the same way as the laws are applied to conventional commerce.</para>
</item>
<item label="(b)">
<para>The following information has been sourced from the Department of the Treasury, the Department of Communications, Information Technology and the Arts and the Australian Institute of Criminology.</para>
<para>When dealing with an Australian business, consumers are afforded the same protection in cyberspace commercial activities that they would be in a physical consumer environment. The <inline font-style="italic">Trade Practices Act 1974</inline> protects consumers from unconscionable conduct and misleading or deceptive conduct.</para>
<para>However, cyberspace commercial activities entail different risks to those that a consumer might usually encounter. The Australian Government, through its <inline font-style="italic">Consumers online</inline> website portal (www.consumersonline.gov.au) provides guidance to consumers about shopping online. The site refers consumers to the Australian Competition and Consumer Commission’s (ACCC) internet shopping web page, which outlines <inline font-style="italic">10 Things to Check before Shopping on the Internet</inline>. In addition, the site provides a link to the Ministerial Council on Consumer Affairs’ online publication, <inline font-style="italic">Shopping in the electronic age</inline>, which provides lists of ‘do’s’ and ‘don’ts’ in electronic transactions.</para>
<para>The Australian Government is also committed to providing online businesses with the information they require to interact effectively with consumers in an electronic environment. In March 2006, the Australian Government published <inline font-style="italic">The Australian Guidelines for Electronic Commerce</inline> booklet which provides guidance to businesses on how to deal with consumers when engaged in business-to-consumer electronic commerce.</para>
<para>Unfortunately, consumers can become the target of unscrupulous operators both in an offline and online setting. The Australian Government understands the risks posed by scams and is committed to providing consumers with the information necessary for them to avoid being caught in a scam.</para>
<para>To assist in this process, the Australasian Consumer Fraud Taskforce was launched in 2005. The brief of the Taskforce is to work collaboratively to enhance the Australian and New Zealand Governments’ enforcement activity against fraud and scams and create a co-ordinated information campaign for consumers. The Taskforce has also contributed to the Scamwatch website (www.scamwatch.gov.au) which explains how to recognise, and how to help stop scams. The AIC has undertaken research for the Taskforce on the nature of consumer fraud victimisation and the extent to which risks emanate from the Internet.</para>
<para>To raise awareness of the types of scams consumers may encounter, the Australian Government first published <inline font-style="italic">The Little Black Book of Scams: A Consumer’s Guide to Scams, Swindles, Rorts and Rip Offs</inline> in 2006. The book details some of the different types of scams which are prevalent both online and offline, how to avoid them and who to contact when a consumer is approached by a scam operator. The book has proved to be instructive for consumers and a fifth edition has recently been published. This information is also available for free download from the ACCC website or from www.consumersonline.gov.au.</para>
<para>The Australian Government, through the Department of Communications, Information Technology and the Arts and the AIC, also provides some important information regarding e-security and internet crime to educate and empower consumers in their electronic transactions. For example, the AIC as part of its research work for the Australian High Tech Crime Centre (AHTCC) has published a series of “High Tech Crime Briefs” and other reports which provide information on the nature and extent of current and future risks of technology-enabled crime for Australians. In addition, a major national survey of Australian businesses is being conducted by the AIC in 2007 to assess the computer security risks which they face and how they are responding to them.</para>
<para>The Australian Government recognises that building and maintaining consumers’ trust and confidence in the online environment is imperative to the continuing growth in the information economy and the productivity that it generates. A package of measures to enhance the protection of home users and small businesses against electronic attacks and fraud was announced in the 2007-08 Budget. These initiatives will focus on raising the level of e-security awareness of home users and small businesses with a view to improving their computer defences and the security of their online behaviours. The Australian Government has also conducted a number of awareness raising activities to assist Australian consumers to transact online in a secure manner.</para>
<para>Other initiatives which protect Australian online consumers include anti-spamming legislation which was introduced in 2003, a review of the legislative framework in relation to spyware, and involvement of Australia’s major banks in investigating phishing or hoax emails.</para>
</item>
<item label="(c)">
<para>The Australian Government has always been quick to respond to changes in the technological landscape that affect commercial exploitation of copyright works online. In 2000, the Australian Government’s ground-breaking Digital Agenda copyright law reforms modernised Australian copyright law to balance protection for creators in the online environment with access to copyright material through new communications technology. Since that time, business models for the commercial exploitation of digital copyright material have grown in number and sophistication.</para>
<para>Last year the Australian Government responded by implementing new copyright laws to protect the digital locks which secure the release of copyright works in the digital and online environment. Providing a strong regulatory system for copyright owners to exploit their works ensures that a variety of copyright material is released in the Australian market to the benefit of the Australian consumer.</para>
<para>The Australian Government is also committed to a robust global copyright regime and is currently preparing to accede to the World Intellectual Property Organisation Internet Copyright treaties. In joining the treaties, Australia will strengthen international copyright protection.</para>
<para>As the content of defamation laws in Australia is determined by State and Territory legislation, questions about the operation of the law in a particular State or Territory jurisdiction should be directed to that jurisdiction.</para>

<para>The movement in the departmental appropriation receivable balance between 30 June 2006 and 30 June 2007 can be attributed to the annual operating result, capital expenditure and balance sheet movements specifically annual changes in receivables, creditors and employee entitlements account balances.</para>
<para>National Blood Authority</para>
<para>There was a nil movement in Appropriations Receivable under an Appropriation Bill. The movement in the Appropriation Receivable Special Account between the 2005-06 balance and the estimated 2006-07 balance was a reduction of cash held in the Official Public Account of $0.192m. The reduction relation to cash drawn down to meet agency expenses during the 2006-07 financial year.</para>
<para>National Health and Medical Research Council (NHMRC)</para>
<para>The movement relates to the appropriation receivable balance which transferred when NHMRC was established as an entity separate from the Department plus departmental appropriation funds not drawn down in 2006-07.</para>
<para>Professional Services Review Scheme</para>
<para>The movement in the appropriation receivable balance between 30 June 2006 and 30 June 2007 can be mainly attributed to the operating surpluses accumulated over recent years as a result of delays in the processing of cases involving legal challenges in the Federal Court, and a reduction in requests for review from Medicare Australia.</para>

<para>The Department manages its annual operating performance with the aim of balancing the budget or achieving small operating surpluses each financial year. In addition, the Department’s creditors and receivables have historically remained relatively constant whilst employee entitlement provisions have generally increased. As a consequence of these factors the Department’s appropriation receivable balance has gradually increased over time. However, the Department’s accommodation strategy anticipates the refurbishment or relocation to new property leasehold office space over the next five years. The Department will utilise its appropriation receivable balance to fund this capital expenditure. Similarly, the Department also anticipates utilising the appropriation receivable balance to improve the Department’s IT environment.</para>
<para>Australian Radiation Protection and Nuclear Safety Bureau (ARPANSA)</para>
<para>The agency manages its annual budget with the aim of achieving a balanced budget each financial year. This is not always possible due to external factors impacting on project progress, particularly those associated with international contractual obligations. Delays in the delivery and installation of scientific and IT equipment also affected the year end position. ARPANSA will be implementing a large scale IT update program including a staged desktop refresh and backup facility enhancement. The appropriation receivable balance will be applied to improve the Agency’s ICT infrastructure.</para>
<para>Cancer Australia</para>
<para>The estimated end of financial year appropriation receivable for the 2006-07 financial year will include accumulated depreciation relating to future asset replacements of $75,940 and provisions for employee entitlements of $137,473. Please note, an estimate of employee entitlements for prior service is not yet available and as a result this balance equates to provisions relating to employee tenure at Cancer Australia only.</para>
<para>National Blood Authority</para>
<para>For the 2007-08 financial year $1.1m has been identified to fund employee entitlements (2008-09: $1.2m, 2009-10: $1.3m, 2010-11: $1.4m) and $0.8m to fund asset replacements (2008-09: $0.5m, 2009-10: $1.4m, 2010-11: $0.1m).</para>
<para>National Health and Medical Research Council</para>
<para>$1.8m has been identified to fund asset replacements and an estimate of $2.7m to fund employee entitlements.</para>
<para>Professional Services Review Scheme (PSR)</para>
<para>PSR is anticipating a significant increase in the number of cases being referred by Medicare Australia which will necessitate additional staffing and other resources. PSR will closely monitor progress to determine if costs can be met from recurrent funding. Asset replacements will include IT equipment of some $500,000 over the next two financial years.</para>

<para>The movement in the departmental appropriation receivable balance between 30 June 2006 and 30 June 2007 can be attributed to the annual operating result, capital expenditure and balance sheet movements specifically annual changes in receivables, creditors and employee entitlements account balances.</para>
<para>National Blood Authority</para>
<para>There was a nil movement in Appropriations Receivable under an Appropriation Bill. The movement in the Appropriation Receivable Special Account between the 2005-06 balance and the estimated 2006-07 balance was a reduction of cash held in the Official Public Account of $0.192m. The reduction relation to cash drawn down to meet agency expenses during the 2006-07 financial year.</para>
<para>National Health and Medical Research Council (NHMRC)</para>
<para>The movement relates to the appropriation receivable balance which transferred when NHMRC was established as an entity separate from the Department plus departmental appropriation funds not drawn down in 2006-07.</para>
<para>Professional Services Review Scheme</para>
<para>The movement in the appropriation receivable balance between 30 June 2006 and 30 June 2007 can be mainly attributed to the operating surpluses accumulated over recent years as a result of delays in the processing of cases involving legal challenges in the Federal Court, and a reduction in requests for review from Medicare Australia.</para>

<para>The Department manages its annual operating performance with the aim of balancing the budget or achieving small operating surpluses each financial year. In addition, the Department’s creditors and receivables have historically remained relatively constant whilst employee entitlement provisions have generally increased. As a consequence of these factors the Department’s appropriation receivable balance has gradually increased over time. However, the Department’s accommodation strategy anticipates the refurbishment or relocation to new property leasehold office space over the next five years. The Department will utilise its appropriation receivable balance to fund this capital expenditure. Similarly, the Department also anticipates utilising the appropriation receivable balance to improve the Department’s IT environment.</para>
<para>Australian Radiation Protection and Nuclear Safety Bureau (ARPANSA)</para>
<para>The agency manages its annual budget with the aim of achieving a balanced budget each financial year. This is not always possible due to external factors impacting on project progress, particularly those associated with international contractual obligations. Delays in the delivery and installation of scientific and IT equipment also affected the year end position. ARPANSA will be implementing a large scale IT update program including a staged desktop refresh and backup facility enhancement. The appropriation receivable balance will be applied to improve the Agency’s ICT infrastructure.</para>
<para>Cancer Australia</para>
<para>The estimated end of financial year appropriation receivable for the 2006-07 financial year will include accumulated depreciation relating to future asset replacements of $75,940 and provisions for employee entitlements of $137,473. Please note, an estimate of employee entitlements for prior service is not yet available and as a result this balance equates to provisions relating to employee tenure at Cancer Australia only.</para>
<para>National Blood Authority</para>
<para>For the 2007-08 financial year $1.1m has been identified to fund employee entitlements (2008-09: $1.2m, 2009-10: $1.3m, 2010-11: $1.4m) and $0.8m to fund asset replacements (2008-09: $0.5m, 2009-10: $1.4m, 2010-11: $0.1m).</para>
<para>National Health and Medical Research Council</para>
<para>$1.8m has been identified to fund asset replacements and an estimate of $2.7m to fund employee entitlements.</para>
<para>Professional Services Review Scheme (PSR)</para>
<para>PSR is anticipating a significant increase in the number of cases being referred by Medicare Australia which will necessitate additional staffing and other resources. PSR will closely monitor progress to determine if costs can be met from recurrent funding. Asset replacements will include IT equipment of some $500,000 over the next two financial years.</para>

At its most basic level, weight gain, which may eventually lead to obesity, occurs as a result of an energy imbalance.

<para>Border Protection Command (BPC) is unable to provide a figure for sightings of illegal foreign fishing vessels. BPC-controlled aerial surveillance assets report all sightings of foreign fishing vessels in Australia’s Exclusive Economic Zone (AEEZ).

It is not possible to positively identify which of these vessels are fishing illegally until they are intercepted by a surface response vessel. Additionally, as many foreign fishing vessels are of very similar construction and carry no identifying markings, the same vessel may be “sighted” (counted) by successive flights on the same or subsequent days.</para>

<para>On the basis of evidence specified in paragraph (2)(a) below, a delegate of the Secretary of the Department of Health and Ageing concluded that Mr Graeme Menere was acting as one of Saitta Pty Ltd’s key personnel at Belvedere Park Nursing Home.</para>

<para>On the basis of the following evidence, a delegate of the Secretary of the Department of Health and Ageing concluded on 16 August 2007 that Mr Graeme Menere was acting as one of Saitta Pty Ltd’s key personnel at Belvedere Park Nursing Home:</para>
<para>- On 8 August 2007 an assessor employed by the Aged Care Standards and Accreditation Agency advised a Departmental officer that the assessors who were undertaking a Review Audit at Belvedere Park Nursing Home reported that Mr Graeme Menere informed them on the morning of 8 August 2007 that, as the Care Manager was on sick leave, he would be acting in her position for the next few weeks.</para>
<para>                - On 11 August 2007 a Departmental officer spoke to Mr Russell Menere, a director of Saitta Pty Ltd, by telephone. During the course of the telephone conversation, Mr Russell Menere asked the Departmental officer to liaise with his brother, Mr Graeme Menere, on matters relating to the Service. Mr Russell Menere told the Departmental officer that he had sent a facsimile indicating that Mr Graeme Menere had his authority to act as a contact person for Saitta Pty Ltd. The Departmental officer stated that the Department had not received the facsimile and that she understood that the Aged Care Standards and Accreditation Agency had received such a facsimile. The Departmental officer explained to Mr Russell Menere that the Agency was a separate body to the Department and she outlined their respective roles.</para>
<para>                - On 13 August 2007 a Departmental officer spoke to Ms Joan Menere, a director of Saitta Pty Ltd, by telephone to confirm arrangements for a meeting to be held on 14 August 2007 and in the course of the conversation Ms Joan Menere stated that Mr Graeme Menere would be attending the meeting. The Departmental officer stated that it would not be appropriate for Mr Graeme Menere to attend, as he is a disqualified individual. The Departmental officer asked Ms Menere whether she was aware that Mr Graeme Menere is a disqualified individual and she responded that she was aware of this fact.</para>
<para>                - In the course of the meeting held on 14 August 2007, Mr Russell Menere stated that he employs Mr Graeme Menere to do odd jobs at the Service. When a Departmental officer drew Mr Russell Menere’s attention to the fact that the email address for the Manager of the service given to the Department by the approved provider was gpm10@bigpond.com and that this would appear to be Mr Graeme Peter Menere’s personal email address, Mr Russell Menere stated that the approved provider would change the email address.</para>
<para>                - In the course of the meeting Mr Russell Menere stated that the Care Manager at the service was on extended leave. When asked who was managing Belvedere Park Nursing Home while the Care Manager was on leave, Mr Russell Menere was unable to name the person who was currently managing the service.</para>

<para>Not at this time. The approved Product Information (PI) document for health professionals already warns that codeine-containing drugs should be avoided in breastfeeding women. There are also extensive precautionary statements in the PI in the section “Use in Pregnancy” where it states that regular use during pregnancy may cause physical dependence in the foetus, leading to withdrawal symptoms in the neonate. Caution is also advised in regards to the administration of codeine during labour as it may cause respiratory depression in the newborn infant.</para>
