Unless any senator wishes for me to ring the bells again, I propose to move straight into the second ballot. No senator requests for the bells to be rung, so we will proceed to the ballot relating to the Foreign Affairs, Defence and Trade References Committee. Pink ballot papers will be distributed. I indicate that the two candidates are again Senators Burston and Lambie. Senators, could I just propose this question: if any senator—and it is awkward because I don't want people to have to declare as it is a secret ballot—wanted to change their vote then we would proceed to a ballot. If senators wanted to keep the same vote they had in the first ballot then it would make no sense in having a second ballot. However, I am in the hands of senators as to whether you want to proceed to a ballot or not. Maybe if I just ask the question of the two leaders: do we wish to proceed to a ballot? The candidates?</span>

The government is bringing this motion forward in order to give the Senate the opportunity to reconsider its decision not to support the government's proposal to give all Australians on the electoral roll the opportunity to have a say on whether or not the definition of marriage should be changed and whether our laws should be changed to allow same-sex couples to marry. Now, this is an issue on which good people right around Australia have strong and sincerely held views on both sides of the argument, and all of us are aware that this is an issue that has come before this chamber on a number of occasions. So far, on each occasion, the parliament has reconfirmed the current definition of marriage in the Marriage Act as being, of course, between a man and a woman. As we also know, that has not resolved the issue, because on those occasions, the losing side of the argument was not prepared to accept that this settled the issue. While some of the views in this parliament may have evolved to a point where there might be a different outcome on this occasion, we believe that if we were to proceed with a vote in the parliament before giving the Australian people the opportunity to have a say on this, the losing side of the argument, even if it were the other side on this occasion, would not accept the outcome. We believe that the best way forward for our country, the best way forward for all of the good people across Australia, who have strong and sincerely held views on both sides of the argument, is to do as we promised them we would do before the last election—that is, to give them the opportunity to have a say via a plebiscite on whether or not they believe our laws should be changed to allow same-sex couples to marry. At the end of that process there will be an outcome, and the government certainly is firmly of the view that the parliament would respect whatever the outcome would be. If there is a 'yes' vote at the end of that process in favour of changing the laws, the parliament will change the laws in order to give effect to that. If there is a 'no' vote, then the government certainly would not be facilitating the change to the law that is being proposed. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">That is the reason why the government last year put forward a bill to conduct a compulsory, personal attendance plebiscite. It was proposed for that to happen on 11 February. Obviously, that particular bill was defeated, and we are proposing for the Senate, here this morning, to reconsider this proposition by the government. We continue to be of the view that this is the best way to ensure that a decision by the parliament on this issue is a unifying moment for the country, and that the losing side of the argument, whichever side that is, can accept the outcome. And we continue to hold the view that the best way to do that is to make all of the Australian people part of the decision-making process.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">If the Senate were to agree to reconsider its position, I can advise on behalf of the government that we are in a position to make all of the necessary arrangements for the compulsory personal attendance plebiscite to take place on Saturday, 25 November 2017, which should enable the parliament in the last sitting fortnight before the end of the year in the case that the 'yes' vote is successful to consider the relevant changes to our Marriage Act to change the law such that same-sex couples would be able to marry.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The reason there's a diversity of views in the parliament is that there is a diversity of views in the community. We are a reflection of that, of course. Some people who argue against this plebiscite make the case that, somehow, Australians are not able to conduct this debate in a way that is appropriately courteous and respectful. We happen to disagree. We trust the Australian people. We trust that the Australian people are able to handle this debate. We believe that the Australian people can handle this debate. Difficult issues are always best handled by allowing a democratic debate and, ultimately, a ballot to take place.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">In this chamber we have debated this for a long time. In recent times, we have debated this issue in our own party room. I absolutely and utterly respect those who have a different view to mine. All of us come to this issue with a set of personal beliefs that guide our decision making. I put myself forward for election to the parliament as a candidate with my views on this issue very well known. I am not a bigot or a bad person because I happen to think that the definition of marriage should be a particular way. I respect the alternative view, and I respect those who pursue an alternative view. I think it is very important for all sides to respect the right for all of us to have and to represent people across the community who have alternative views.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">If there are those who do not participate in this debate in a respectful way that is regrettable. I think that the Australian community is able to deal with this and to handle this. With this sort of process, we have a three-month period in which there will be a conversation across the Australian community which will ultimately lead to an outcome. I should advise the chamber that, in order to address some of the concerns that were raised by various stakeholders in the context of the debate last year, the government have decided, should this bill successfully be restored to the <span style="font-style:italic;">Notice Paper</span> and should we go to the second reading debate and ultimately to the committee stage, that we would amend the bill to remove the public funding for the 'yes' and 'no' cases in order to facilitate the best possible context for this decision by the Australian people. In the end, the Australian people know what their views are on this. It's not going to be a complicated proposition for the Australian people to make a decision, one way or the other. It's not going to be a complicated decision for the Australian people to make, one way or the other. On that basis, the government have made that decision.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I should say that if this proposal of the government for a compulsory personal attendance plebiscite on 25 November is, again, unsuccessful in the Senate then the government believe that we do have a constitutional and legal way forward to keep faith with our commitment to the Australian people at the last election to give them a say and make them part of the decision-making process on whether or not our rules should be changed to change the definition of marriage to allow same-sex couples to marry.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Indeed, if this bill is not restored and if this bill does not ultimately pass the Senate, then the government will be working, through the Australian Bureau of Statistics, to survey all Australians on the electoral roll, giving them the opportunity to have their say on whether or not they believe that the law should be changed to allow same-sex couples to marry, and we will get an outcome at the end of that process. It will be a voluntary postal plebiscite. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The government is very confident that we have the constitutional and legal authority to make this happen, and I will share with the chamber why the government is of that view. Firstly, of course, all senators would be aware of section 51 of the Constitution, which gives the Commonwealth parliament powers to make laws in relation to censuses and statistics. Indeed, the Commonwealth parliament has chosen to make such laws—namely, the Census and Statistics Act 1905 and the ABS Act 1975. Under those laws, the Australian Statistician and the ABS can request information of all Australians on the electoral roll. Indeed, there is express provision in the ABS Act for the ABS to have access to the electoral roll, so the ABS is in a position where they can, at the direction of the Treasurer, seek information from all eligible electors that are validly enrolled on the electoral roll and ask them for their views on whether or not they believe that the law should be changed to allow same-sex couples to marry. Now, that is not our preferred option, but it's the next-best option in order to keep faith with our deep commitment with the Australian people and our respect for the diversity of views across the Australian community—sincerely held views across the Australian community—and bring this issue to a resolution. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Furthermore, as the finance minister, the parliament has appropriated to me in Appropriations Act (No. 1) 2017-18 what is called a Finance Minister's Advance to deal with unforeseen expenditures, amongst other things. Of course, this was an unforeseen expenditure at the time that the appropriations bill was dealt with. There is a Finance Minister's Advance, which essentially enables me to make appropriations of up to $295 million for unforeseen items of expenditure. This is an unforeseen item of expenditure, which will help us cover the cost of up to $122 million for this exercise designed to give the Australian people a say on whether or not they believe the definition of marriage should be changed. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">In summary, the ABS and the Australian Statistician have the power to ask the question. I have the power to appropriate the money. They have the power to expend the money under the section 61 of the Constitution—a combination of section 61 of the Constitution, of the executive power, and the powers out of the various pieces of legislation governing their overall operations at present. They have the power in relation to that. They have the power to get access to the electoral roll and, of course, the ABS also has the power under section 16A of the ABS Act to arrange the secondment of officers to the ABS. On this occasion, the secondment of officers that would be arranged is the secondment of officers from the Australian Electoral Commission. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The intention would be for this process to get under way as swiftly and efficiently as possible—namely, for the requests for information from the ABS to Australians on the electoral roll to start getting posted as of 12 September, for there to be a period until 7 November for people to return their filled-in forms and provide the information to the ABS on what their views are in relation to the definition of marriage, and for us to have a final outcome in relation to this voluntary postal plebiscite process by 15 November. Again, that puts us into a position where, if there is a positive outcome, we would be able to deal with this issue once and for all in the final sitting fortnight this calendar year. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Some people say voluntary ballots are not as credible as compulsory ballots. Given that most democracies around the world actually operate under a voluntary voting system, I find that very hard to accept. Because, in the end, if people feel strongly about it, or if they have a view about it one way or the other, they have the opportunity to participate and they will participate. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I certainly would encourage all Australians to participate in this process. One hundred per cent of Australians on the electoral roll will have the opportunity to participate in this process and to express their view. So nobody who is entitled to vote will miss out. Everybody who is entitled to vote is actually able to put their hand up in relation to this exercise. Furthermore, postal voting is also quite an established way of organising democratic processes in Australia and in other parts of the world. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Again, I say to those senators and to those Australians who have concerns about the voluntary postal plebiscite that there is a better way, of course. A better way is that which we are putting before the chamber again today—that is, to go through the normal, compulsory, personal attendance exercise on Saturday, 25 November. If the Senate votes to restore this bill to the <span style="font-style:italic;">Notice Paper</span>, if the Senate votes to engage in the second reading debate on this bill and if the Senate ultimately passes this bill, then all Australians, through the established democratic processes here in Australia, in a way that is very closely aligned to the way federal elections are conducted in Australia, would have the opportunity to have their say. At the other side of this debate, this actually then puts Australia into a position where those Australians who feel strongly about this but are on the losing side of the argument will be in a better position to accept the change that will then happen. That is our submission to the chamber, and I commend this motion. </span>

                  <a href="00AOU" type="MemberSpeech">
                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Senator WONG</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">South Australia</span>—<span class="HPS-MinisterialTitles">Leader of the Opposition in the Senate</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">10:11</span>):  This motion is not about giving Australians a say. This motion is about weakness and division on that side of the parliament. This motion is about a government so divided and so legalist that they have to handball a hard decision to the community to make it because they can't make it in their party room. That's what this is about. And no amount of words from my colleague can hide us from the fact that this is one big massive handball, because this is a government without a leader and that is utterly divided on this issue. That is what this vote is about. I will come back to the substantive motion in a moment, but let's just talk about the procedural issue. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">This is a government that is so weak, it won't even bring the bill back. Do you know what the motion before you is? It's saying: 'Oh, you know that second reading vote we had? Well, we did not like the outcome, so can we have it again?' That's what this motion is. Those opposite don't even have the guts to bring it back through the lower house, probably because they don't know if they can hold all their people. So they put a motion on the <span style="font-style:italic;">Notice Paper</span> saying, 'Oh, we just want to restart the second reading, even though you all voted against it.' That's what they're doing. It's a motion to overturn a clear decision made last year by this Senate, where 33 senators voted against and only 29 in favour, and the second reading was defeated. The matter was settled—comprehensively. But, because the Liberal Party room cannot accept that, now we've got to come in here and deal with a procedural motion to try and bring the second reading debate back on, instead of reintroducing the bill here or in the House, and instead of going through the normal process.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The reality is that this is all a stunt. And everybody knows that. I have a lot of regard for Senator Cormann. He's generally a very decent person to deal with, and he's trying valiantly to create some logic around what is an utterly ridiculous position, which is: 'We just want to keep not having a vote, and we can't decide to have a vote, so we're going to have all these mechanisms, even though the Senate said no. We want a plebiscite. If we can't have that, we'll have a postal ballot, because we can't get to a decision inside our own party room.' It's a stunt. It's a damaging stunt and it's an expensive stunt. There are a lot of things you could do with 120 million bucks, aren't there? It's about three million GP visits or a couple of thousand teachers. I'm sure we could go through a whole range of things that $122 million could be spent on, far better than a vote that is not going to be binding. Let's understand that.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We can talk a lot about democracy and Australians having their say. Eric Abetz is not going to change his vote if this is successful. Senator Bernardi is not going to change his vote. He and I have vehemently disagreed. He's not going to change his position. It's like one big opinion survey to get over the fact that the Liberal party room can't make a decision because they're so divided on this issue and because Malcolm Turnbull, regrettably, has not had the courage of his conviction.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">This is a vote whose sole aim is to stop the members of this parliament being given a chance to do their job and vote. This is a vote because some in the coalition can never countenance equality, and they're never going to change their minds. They simply cannot countenance people like me, and others, being equal. It is as simple as that. They're not going to change their minds on this issue. If you would just bring on a vote, we could save the country $120 million and, frankly, put us all out of the misery of having to keep talking about this issue. Frankly, the country has moved on.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I'd also make this point: we live in a parliamentary democracy. We're elected to do a job. Sometimes we do it well and sometimes we do it less well. We're elected to come here to vote, to make decisions. This country did not have a plebiscite or a postal ballot on the Racial Discrimination Act, the Sex Discrimination Act, native title legislation, the scrapping of the White Australia policy or whether women should get equal pay. I don't think Tony Abbott took to a people's vote the cutting of billions of dollars out of health and education. I don't think the government took to a people's vote whether or not corporations should get a big tax cut. But on this they want us to say that we handball it to the community, and it is simply to do with their internal divisions.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I do want to respond to the comment by Senator Cormann that this could be a unifying moment and that people could be respectful. I hope that people watching me debate wouldn't think I'm a shrinking violet. And I know what a hard debate's like. But I tell you: have a read of some of the things that are said about us and our families and then come back here and tell us that this is a unifying moment. The Australian Christian Lobby described our children as 'the stolen generation'. We love our children, and I object—as does every person who cares about children and as do all those same-sex couples in this country who have kids—to being told that our children are a 'stolen generation'. You talk about unifying moments? That's not a unifying moment. It's exposing our children to that kind of hatred. I wouldn't mind so much if you were prepared to speak out on it, if the Prime Minister were prepared to stand up and say, 'That is wrong.' But what does he do? He says it's a dreadful reason, to not trust the Australian people. He says don't be silly; of course we can have a sensible debate. Well, maybe he should stand up for some of the people who don't have a voice, because we know the sort of debate that is already there. Let me say, for many children who are parented by same-sex couples and for many young LGBTI kids, this already ain't a respectful debate.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Labor will be opposing this motion, and we do so because of our longstanding position, which has been considered by the party and our opposition to a plebiscite. And what I would say to the crossbench is that you made the right decision last time; please make the same decision on this occasion.</span>

It's expensive—over $100 million that could go towards the building of a new school or having new medicine listed on the PBS or saving the Great Barrier Reef; there are so many better ways to spend $100 million. We oppose it because it's unnecessary. We're paid good money in this joint. We've got a job to do. We're legislators. We should just get on and do it. I know this government likes outsourcing. It's taking it to a whole new level. This is a job for the parliament to do.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We oppose this motion because, far from being a unifying moment, it will, totally unnecessarily, unleash hatred and bigotry within our community and expose people to the sort of debate that they should never be exposed to. We do it because, ultimately, the outcome of this plebiscite is meaningless. We've got members of the government who say, 'If the plebiscite is supportive, we won't change our view,' and we've got other members who say, 'If the plebiscite says that Australians don't want marriage equality'—something I find hard to believe—'we'll continue to vote in favour of marriage equality.' What's the point? </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Most importantly, we will not support this plebiscite because it violates a fundamental principle in any liberal democracy, and that is you never put a question of discrimination of human rights to an opinion poll. That is the antithesis of the way in which any modern liberal democracy deals with questions of basic human rights. In fact, we recognise that, when it comes to the protection of minorities, it is the role of us in this parliament to show some leadership rather than putting those questions to a glorified opinion poll. </span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">So we don't support a plebiscite. We never have. Now we are in this ridiculous situation that, should the plebiscite as originally conceived by the government not proceed, we're going to see a postal plebiscite. My goodness! You can't write this stuff. We've entered into a parallel universe here. What next? Carrier pigeons being inflicted upon the community? This is Bizarro World stuff.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">Why is it happening? Let us name it. It's a government that is divided. It's in turmoil. It's making decisions in its own self-interest rather than in the interests of the Australian community. That is what's happening right now. I have to say it is very sad to see a Prime Minister so diminished, so contorted, so confused and so weak that he has given in—a total, complete capitulation—to the hard Right within the Liberal Party. The sad reality is that, if this Prime Minister cannot lead his party, he cannot lead the nation. </span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We should come out of this chamber with a clear view that our job is to stand up for people right across the community, to end discrimination wherever it exists and to make sure that, where two people love each other, we respect and acknowledge that love. We need to use the most precious thing that we are given when we are elected to the Australian parliament—our vote—to support those values. That is what the Australian Greens will do every time we are confronted with a bill on marriage equality. Let us get this thing done and let us show those many millions of Australians who want us to do it that we stand with them rather than making decisions that are in our own narrow self-interest.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Victoria</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">10:23</span>):  As I said in question time yesterday to the Attorney-General, 'Let us do our job.' We're here to vote on this. We voted down a plebiscite the last time. I have quoted before various people, including the heroes of the Liberal Party. John Howard said in 2004:</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Small">We've decided to insert this into the Marriage Act to make it very plain that that is our view of a marriage and to also make it very plain that the definition of a marriage that should rest in the hands ultimately of the parliament of the nation and should not over time … be subject to redefinition or change by courts, it is something that ought to be expressed through the elected representatives of the country … </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">There's no mention of a bloody plebiscite and no mention of a postal plebiscite. That's John Howard. Tony Abbott has said in the past that it shouldn't be left to the courts. Tony Abbott said when a plebiscite was pushed through the party room the last time that it would only exist for the life of the 44th Parliament. This is the 45th Parliament.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">As for people who say that Malcolm Turnbull promised—he did promise. He honoured that promise. He took that promise to the parliament. He got it through the House of Representatives, through the other place. He brought it here and he lost. So where's plan B? </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">With every other bit of legislation, they take it back downstairs, they bring it back here or they bring it back in with amendments. I will commend the government for the amendment they are putting up—and they can technically say that this is a slightly different bill, because they are going to amend it to cut out the public funding, which is a stupid idea. That'll save them $20 million. They should save $122 million for the other place. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Tony Abbott also said, on 2GB—sorry, the former Prime Minister—that marriage was between a man and a woman, and that it was brought in to protect women and children and therefore any move to break up a marriage would be a disastrous situation, shouldn't be done. Yet how come the Liberals' light on the hill—their light on the hill; Prime Minister Bob Menzies attacked so-called man-and-woman marriage, because he was the person who said there will be a conscience vote, back in 1958, a conscience vote for no-fault divorce. What's going to protect marriage, if you believe this more than that? No-fault divorce. He said:</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Small">As the question of divorce closely touches the individual conscience of members, we propose that, though it will be a government measure, it shall not be treated as a party measure. Therefore, honourable members will be in a position to discuss it according to their own lights and views.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I'm going to steal from Menzies and say: as the question of same-sex marriage closely touches the individual conscience of members. I propose that there will be a government measure—we would hope. It should not be treated as a party measure, and honourable members will be in a position to discuss it according to their own lights and views. Although I know there's going to be a move to try to kill this off before the government gets its second reading—it's tempting—but I voted against the plebiscite before. I wanted the government to have their say, even though there's nothing left to be said about same-sex marriage. I will support them as they try to get the second reading up. But then I will tell you: this man is not for turning. I don't care who comes at me or with what. I will vote a plebiscite down again, and I would also vote down any foolish postal plebiscite, which I think is open to fraud. </span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">And is this government of all the people—what about young people? Young people wouldn't even know how to open a mailbox. What about them? Are you going to have text votes? Are you going to have email votes for young people? And older people—this one will be voluntary, so you will get the special-interest groups on both sides coming out with the hardest and toughest areas. I think it's a disgrace. </span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I watched the New Zealand parliament last night pass their same-sex marriage bill. I watched them pass it, and the moment in that house in New Zealand—and it's a single house—after it passed, equality for all people, they all came out and the gallery started singing 'Pokarekare Ana'. It was the most wonderful moment of unity. This government could unify Australia, if they just pass this damn bill, get it through, get it off the agenda. </span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">New South Wales</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">10:28</span>):  I indicate that I will support this motion. I also indicate that I support same-sex marriage not for reasons of equality, as is often the argument used by its supporters, but because I don't believe it's any role of the government to tell people who they can marry. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I have supported same-sex marriage since I have been in this place. I have supported it ever since it was ever mooted. I believe I'm the only senator in this place who, in the last parliament and the current parliament, has supported it at every opportunity, including procedural votes. The question we are debating, though, is how to achieve it. The issue, I think, that really underlies this discussion is: is there a perfect way to achieve it? I don't think perfection should be the overriding factor here. I think achieving same-sex marriage should be the end result, and we shouldn't be too fussy about how we get there, as long as we do get there. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We have three options available to us. The free vote is my first choice, but I have to say I am not at all certain that, if there were a free vote, it would pass both houses of parliament. I am not at all sure, and I question why people are so adamant that a free vote is the only way to do this. How can they be so confident that it's going to pass? A plebiscite has its flaws; however, it was previously, in years past, supported by Labor. There is a cost aspect which can't be ignored. My preference would be to hold the plebiscite at the next election. I would've been happy for it to be held at the last election too. I'm absolutely confident—and opinion polls support this—that a plebiscite would be overwhelmingly in favour of changing the Marriage Act to allow same-sex marriage. Yes, Senator Di Natale makes a valid point about voting on other people's rights, and I think that's a legitimate objection, but there are countries—democracies every bit as robust and secure as ours; Switzerland is obviously right at the top—where they vote on these sorts of things all the time, and the sky doesn't fall, so I don't think it's a very profound objection. Then there's the postal vote option. It has its flaws but it could work; I'm certainly not going to condemn it out of hand. </span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">In the end, my concern is for the same-sex couples that want to get married. They're the ones I'm concerned about. I will not let the perfect be the enemy of the good in achieving that.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">South Australia</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">10:31</span>):  My colleagues Senators Griff and Kakoschke-Moore and I cannot support this motion. This motion seeks to restore to the <span style="font-style:italic;">Notice Paper</span> the very same bill that the Senate rejected on 7 November last year by 33 votes to 29. The government is using a little-known, little-used procedure. It's a quite proper procedure that they're entitled to use, but we are also entitled to say this should not go ahead. We've already dealt with this issue. It does not need to be dealt with again. We do not need to revisit a debate on a bill which was comprehensively defeated at the second reading stage. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">There ought to be a free vote of the parliament on this issue. I, along with my colleagues, am strongly supportive of marriage equality. We should deal with this. That's what we're being paid for as members of parliament: to deal with this issue. Senator Leyonhjelm makes a good point that there are other robust democracies in the world—the United States, in California in particular; and Switzerland—where citizens vote on issues all the time, but the fundamental difference is that they're initiated by citizens, they are binding and there is a process in place where citizens can say, 'The parliament is not listening to us, and we need to deal with this issue.'</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">This is the opposite. This is a case where the parliament is not listening to the people. We ought to deal with this issue as a matter of urgency. For those who have put to me, privately—and I respect their views—I want to pick up on what Senator Cormann said: we need to have a respectful debate. I support marriage equality but I also respect the views of those who do not. I think it's important that we have a debate free of rancour and bile, one that is considered and respectful on this important issue. But when it comes to the alternatives that have been put to us—if you don't vote for this, we're going to end up with a postal vote, which is a far worse option—can I say there is a third option, which is for the parliament to decide this issue as a matter of urgency. This really is a case of <span style="font-style:italic;">Groundhog Day</span>, but we're not in Punxsutawney; we're in Canberra. It seems that we're going to keep repeating the same mistake over and over again until there is a free vote of the parliament to deal with this issue comprehensively, once and for all.</span>

This parliament has the ability to have a vote on equal marriage. We could have a vote on equal marriage this week. Our Prime Minister could pay some attention to and take his lead from Germany, where Angela Merkel, despite not being in support of equal marriage, made the decision to allow a free vote in the German parliament. That was on a Monday. They achieved marriage equality on the Friday. Instead, this government is putting the lives of LGBTIQ people through a torturous obstacle course. That is what this plebiscite is—let alone the shonky, illegitimate harebrained scheme of a postal plebiscite, if that is what comes to pass.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">I've got news for this government: LGBTI people exist. We are here, and our relationships are as valid as any other people's relationships in this country. I am married to my partner, Penny. We have been married for 31 years. Penny is transgendered. Under our current legislation, with the current ban on people of the same sex being married, if Penny were to change her gender on her birth certificate from male to female—she is female—we would have to be divorced. This is the sort of discrimination that still exists. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I feel very privileged that we are married and that we had the opportunity to be married 31 years ago. But what about all of those people who haven't had the opportunity to be married, particularly the ageing couples who have a partner who is dying? That's what people are asking for. They are asking for their relationships to be treated equally, as all other people's relationships in this country are. Not having our relationships treated equally has gone on far too long for us. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We know that we've got a majority of parliamentarians in this parliament who support equal marriage. We know that there is a majority of Australians across the country who support equal marriage. Opinion poll after opinion poll after opinion poll show that to be the case. Yet, because of the internal politics of the government, we cannot move forward. It is so frustrating. There is anger and disappointment around the country, yet what is being proposed is just more delays—more of this torturous obstacle—and putting our rights to a public vote. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">There are very good reasons why you don't put issues of human rights to a public vote, as Senator Di Natale pointed out. The reality is we know what's going to happen if we have either this plebiscite or this shonky postal vote: the hurt, the hatred, the attacks on LGBTI people are going to be amplified in our community. We have already seen evidence of that. We've already seen stories in the press today about the leaflets that are being prepared. They are saying that the children of gay and lesbian parents are more prone to 'abuse and neglect' and:</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Small">Married biological parents have a better record for providing safety and development of healthy, well-adjusted adult children. They minimise abuse and neglect of children.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">This is awful stuff, and that is what having a plebiscite—putting our rights to a public vote—is going to unleash upon LGBTI people and their families. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">You will have children of same-sex couples being told that their parents' relationships aren't as valid and, for some reason, in their families, they are going to be more prone to abuse and neglect. This is not what we need to be doing. In Ireland, where they had to have constitutional change, they had to have a public vote, and we have the evidence of the damage that that debate caused. We don't need to do that here. What we need to do here is to move on as quickly as possible to having a free vote in this parliament so that our relationships can be legalised. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We are not going to be blackmailed by those who say, 'If you, the Senate, don't support this plebiscite then we've got to have this opinion poll'—this $122 billion, non-binding, non-compulsory opinion poll that we know is going to be illegitimate, that we know would have low voter turnout and that we know would disenfranchise young people. We are not going to be blackmailed into saying, 'We've got to support this legislated plebiscite rather than go down that track', because they are not the options that should be on the table.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The option that needs to be on the table is having a free vote in this parliament as quickly as possible. When we do that, we know what is going to happen. When we do that, when this legislation, as it inevitably will, passes this parliament, there will be celebration. There will be joy on the benches of both the House of Representatives and the Senate. There will be massive celebrations in the community. The end result will be that people will be able to marry the person that they love. That is going to be a wonderful thing. It's something that has been so long in coming. I'm looking forward to that day. What I ask the government is to stop all of this torturous obstacle course that they're putting us through—the torturous process that we're being put through. Let's move on as quickly as possible to having a free vote so that we can join in that celebration and join in the celebration of the love of two people for each other.</span>

At that time, I indicated that the government supported the policy of banning the offering of lines of credit, but that it was our preference to pursue that issue via the National Consumer Protection Framework that we're developing with the states and territories. Nonetheless, the government understands that the will of the Senate is that the Commonwealth legislate this ban as part of the bill.</span>

Credit betting by small on-course bookmakers, as opposed to the large online corporate operators, has been a longstanding traditional practice at racecourses for decades. It forms an important part of the business of on-course bookmakers. The government's consultation with bookmaker associations revealed that the amendment that was passed would have had a serious detrimental impact on many of the around 500 on-course bookmakers who operate across Australia, all of whom are effectively small businesses. It's important that I acknowledge that my belief is that certainly wasn't the intent of the colleagues who supported that amendment.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The government undertook consultation on an alternative set of amendments, including with the Australian Bookmakers Association, Responsible Wagering Australia, Financial Counselling Australia and Tabcorp. I should also note that, on 27 April, state and territory gambling ministers agreed to the proposition which was put forward in the House by the government. Those consultations gave the government confidence that the government amendments, which the House of Representatives agreed to in June, will enact the spirit and intent of the original Nick Xenophon Team amendments whilst avoiding the unintended consequences.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">In summary, the government amendment moved in the House will prohibit wagering operators from providing or offering credit to customers. It will prohibit operators from promoting or facilitating credit via a third party, such as small account credit contracts, also known as pay-day lenders, which was not captured in the original Senate amendment. It will provide criminal and civil penalties for contravention of the credit prohibitions—up to $675,000 per day for companies, which is higher than the original Senate amendment. It will provide an exemption for on-course bookmakers, all of whom operate as small businesses, to provide credit via telephone. It will allow a transition period of six months before the prohibition comes into effect to allow wagering operators and consumers to adjust their business and betting practices, and no time limit is placed on the recovery of debts. It will give authority to the Australian Communications and Media Authority to undertake a statutory review after three years to assess the effectiveness of these new provisions. Credit will not be permitted to be provided via online means by any wagering operator. This measure will deliver on the government's 2013 election commitment and its response to the 2015 illegal offshore wagering review to ban lines of credit being offered for online betting altogether.</span>

                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I thank my Senate colleagues for their constructive engagement and cooperation with the government as we worked to develop these amendments. I particularly want to acknowledge the work of my colleague Minister Tudge who has taken primary carriage of this matter and who has worked hard to achieve the important reforms that are contained in the bill.</span>

                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">South Australia</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">10:54</span>):  I thank the minister for that explanation. Again, Senator Kakoschke-Moore will have a number of questions in relation to it. Clearly, credit betting is very problematic when it comes to fuelling, accelerating and causing gambling addiction, but I understand that credit betting from on-course bookmakers—not the corporate bookmakers; the online bookmakers—is very different in terms of levels of harm and the safeguards that can be implemented with on-course bookmakers. The fact that there is that physical contact is quite different—and we acknowledge that.</span>

                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Of course, I do not support credit betting at all, but I'm also trying to be pragmatic and I do not want the perfect to be the enemy of the good. Having said that, I think that a compromise has been reached. Whilst not perfect, it has been done in good faith with the government. We want to see how effective it will be and there obviously needs to be continual review for those parts of the bill that we thought should have gone further. But, for those parts of the bill that did good work in this space in terms of dealing with online gambling and dealing with problem gambling from online betting, this bill is overall a beneficial bill and that is why we should not stand in its way.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Of course, we do want to go further. I am pleased that the minister has sought the advice of Financial Counselling Australia. I launched their report a couple of years ago on the impact of online betting, which was a trigger for introducing the legislation that I introduced, and Senator Kakoschke-Moore has worked with me very closely in terms of this. So we do not stand in the way of these amendments, but we think it is important to raise some concerns about loopholes in relation to the bill and the continual monitoring that needs to take place in respect of that. Having said that, we will not oppose this bill but we think that there are some legitimate questions to ask in terms of the ongoing monitoring of this bill as to its effectiveness.</span>

A situation that comes to my mind could be where a customer creates an account for an online wagering provider, provides details that indicate that they are living in the US when in actual fact they're living in Australia. Can you provide the chamber with some more information about how the decision is made that the sports betting company has acted in good faith in providing credit to that customer whom they believed was outside of Australia?</span>

                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">New South Wales</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">11:01</span>):  I have a few remarks on this revisiting of the Interactive Gambling Amendment Bill. The Senate is again fiddling with it. The bill seeks to ban in-play gambling, in-play sports betting, with Australian providers and is operating under the deluded idea that other countries will somehow respect Australia's prohibition approach, even when they don't agree with it themselves and their preferred approach is to regulate, monitor and tax. I am led to believe that Australia is even contemplating taking a leaf out of China's book by IP blocking if that does not work. </span>

                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This is despite the evidence about online poker—which is my primary concern in relation to this legislation and is again caught up in this ban. Online poker is less harmful than other services that are allowed under the Interactive Gambling Act, like online sports betting. This was confirmed at a recent hearing of the inquiry into online poker which I established. Online poker is a game requiring considerable skill and results in very little problem gambling. Poker can, of course, be played in pubs, clubs, casinos and private homes but not online, unless on an overseas site, where consumer protections are far less utilised. This is absurd. I call on the government and other senators to commit to enacting the inquiry's recommendations in relation to online poker when the committee reports next month. </span>

The only comment I would make is that this legislation is, in part, seeking to give effect to the original intent of the IGA, which did not envisage that poker would be legal in the form that some people had the view that it was. So part of the purpose of this legislation is to make clear the original intent of the original legislation. </span>

                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">New South Wales</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">11:04</span>): Labor has always maintained a strong stance to ensure appropriate harm minimisation measures are in place to protect and assist our community. The majority of people who bet enjoy it and gamble in a responsible manner. However, Labor also knows that gambling in our community can, in some cases, have devastating social, financial and emotional consequences. That's why we have supported many elements of the Interactive Gambling Amendment Bill. This bill is an important starting point that will go towards improving the protections for those who choose to wager within an online environment. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">With regard to the government's amendment, Labor's been very clear on its position when it comes to a ban on credit betting. We think a ban on credit betting is an important part of harm minimisation measures, especially in relation to problem gambling. It is very pleasing to see the government has picked up on this element of harm minimisation reform. However, I have to say, although we are pleased by this measure, we are disappointed the government was slow to act to ban credit betting. As part of the first tranche of reform, the government's Interactive Gambling Amendment Bill 2016 fails to include a ban on credit betting, even though this has been coalition policy since August 2013. Unlike Labor, coalition senators also failed to support a Senate amendment prohibiting credit betting. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I'd also like to take this opportunity to acknowledge the consultation that has occurred in relation to the track-side bookmakers and the exemptions that will be provided in this bill for them. When it comes to that exemption, I understand my colleague in the other place the member for Franklin has sought some assurances from the government and the minister that the turnover of $30 million is an appropriate threshold to have this exemption for track-side bookmakers. It is, of course, only intended for track-side bookmakers that this occurs. So, if there is any way that any other of the gaming operators try to get through this loophole, we would expect the government to act on that. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">So, in relation to this bill, we are, on this side of the chamber, really pleased to see that, finally, we will get some harm minimisation for people in an online gambling environment. Consequently, we will be supporting the government's amendment. Thank you. </span>

We're proposing it, through the framework, with the states and territories, but we do recognise the will of the Senate on this matter, and the legislation in its current form will give effect to that.

                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">
                    <a href="AI6" type="MemberSpeech">
                      <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Senator CAMERON</span>
                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">New South Wales</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">11:10</span>):  Just to reiterate, we have dealt with a number of amendments—amendments (2), (3), (4), (5), (7), (9), (11), (12) and (13)—on sheet 8143, and they were agreed to by the government. In hindsight, I think that the government's agreeing to these amendments demonstrates how badly this bill was drafted. Whereas we have no tolerance for corruption in any form, the bill is based on recommendations by Commissioner Heydon in the final report of a royal commission that was a public and political attack on the trade union movement. The final report of that royal commission was released more than 12 months ago, yet the Department of Employment has confirmed that there was no stakeholder consultation on the process of drafting the bill. I suppose if there had been some stakeholder consultation the concerns that were raised by the ACTU, the employer groups and the Law Council of Australia would have been considered by the minister. But, as is typical of this minister, anything that can be done to attack the trade union movement, diminish collective bargaining and weaken workers' access to proper advice and conditions on the job will be done.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The department first issued drafting instructions on 10 February 2017 and the bill was introduced on 22 March, so it took just a few weeks to draft this bill. What this has shown is that the minister has had to capitulate on so many of the amendments that we have put forward. This was an inadequate process. There are still problems in the way in which the offences have been drafted, and the Ai Group have said that some important changes are needed to the bill to ensure fairness to employers, employees, registered organisations, officers of registered organisations and employees of registered organisations. Given the flaws in the bill identified by both employer and employee representatives, Labor is proposing a reasonable package of improvements. None of them could be said to thwart the intention of the bill or render the offences impotent. On the other hand, they do address some of the overreach, whether intentional or not, in the drafting of the offences, which have potentially significant consequence for both unions and employers.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I just want to take the opportunity to have a look at this government's position on alleged corruption within the trade union movement and consider it against the blind eye that they turn to corruption in a range of areas, particularly in business. You know, we've had offshore-bribery allegations against some of the biggest companies in Australia. Do you ever hear that lot over there, that rabble of a government, get up and take any umbrage about those issues? No, you don't hear any speeches about that, but you hear speech after speech after speech against the union movement in this country, designed to try to diminish the union movement's capacity to operate effectively for its membership. Offshore bribery is an international offence and it's got huge implications for companies in this country and huge implications for our economy. If some of these companies get banned from operating internationally, you watch the job losses; you watch the problems that will be identified.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We had the Panama papers from Mossack Fonseca, where Australians were named about moving money offshore for illegitimate purposes. Did we hear any speeches from this rabble of a government? No, we don't hear anything about that. We've got multinational corporate profit shifting—shifting their profits overseas to minimise tax payments in this country. It gets hardly any attention from this government. We have banks behaving badly, banks behaving illegally, and banks ripping off ordinary Australians. I have to concede that Senator Williams has been consistent in his position in relation to banks. But do you ever hear much from the coalition itself on the issue of banks? No. Why won't they have a royal commission? Senator Williams knows why there should be a royal commission. We understand why there should be a royal commission.</span>

                    </a>  'Should've had it years ago,' says Senator Williams. I think that's right. Senator Williams and I were on the economics committee when we did deal with that issue. That's been taken up, subsequently, by Senator Williams and Senator Dastyari in relation to a banks royal commission.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Labor is of the view that, if you're going to be serious about corruption and you're not biased against the trade union movement, you should deal with these issues. We have had the Greens say that we should have a national corruption oversight. Well, as I said, I don't disagree with that, but I have to indicate that there is a committee looking at that issue now, and that should be dealt with. I'm of the view that this is simply an attack on the trade union movement. It's a biased approach from this government. It's an incompetent approach by this government. We've had bank bill swap rates problems at Westpac and we've had money laundering with the Commonwealth Bank. Do you hear them getting up and saying anything about that? Not very often. They do the minimum they have to do to stop any ongoing inquiry, and they are opposed to a royal commission into the banks.</span>

                    </a>  I apologise for not addressing my remarks through the chair, but Senator Williams and I have been working on these issues for many years. I understand Senator Williams's frustration at his own party and the coalition that he's part of not dealing with these issues and not dealing with them effectively—the whole web of funding entities across the coalition. Do they do anything about that? No, they do not.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">And we have the latest one: the Leader of the Opposition in Victoria, Matthew Guy, attending a fundraiser with mafia figures and attempting to get funding. It is unbelievable that they don't deal with the problems on their own side, but they always concentrate on the trade union movement. We have Damien Mantach, a former state secretary of the Liberal Party both in Tasmania and Victoria, ending up in jail. That's one who's in jail, Senator Williams! A former secretary of the Liberal Party is in jail for defrauding the party of $1.5 million. Again, why is it that it's always the trade union movement that gets hauled up in this place by this rabble of a government?</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">In the CBA inquiry, concern was raised over whistleblowers. Has the government done anything on whistleblowers to help the public get some protection? All they did was introduce legislation for whistleblowers in the trade union movement, but not the banking industry. So if we're talking about corruption and you're talking about dealing with corruption, this mob is not dealing with corruption effectively. When we get the outcome of the parliamentary inquiry into a national ICAC, it will be interesting to see whether this lot will actually do anything about it. The evidence so far would be that, no, they won't, because they are so ideologically committed to trying to destroy the trade union movement—to destroy workers' rights to collectively bargain, to destroy workers' access to union advice on the job—that that's all they focus on when corruption is mentioned. It's always about corruption in the trade union movement.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">When you look at the issues, even after a royal commission, they are miniscule against the corruption and the illegality that's going on across this nation by business and the people who donate to Senator Cash and her party—but they won't touch them. They won't go near them. There are big issues in relation to this. Every bank—the CBA, the ANZ, Macquarie Bank, the National Australia Bank, Westpac—has problems, but what do this mob do? They do nothing. They defend the banks and they will not go to a royal commission to deal with corruption there.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We have to be a bit cynical about what this is all about. We are of the view that this is simply about diminishing the capacity of the trade union movement to operate effectively. That's why we have a range of amendments that we are putting up to try and make this bill a bit better, but I'm not sure that all of the advice that we are providing through this approach in the committee will be heeded by the government. I'm not sure if this government is ever going to treat the trade union movement with the respect it should have in this country. We've seen the Reserve Bank Governor say that, if workers don't get wage increases—and the key way workers get wage increases in this country is through the actions and support of their unions—then the economy will continue to decline.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">There are huge issues in relation to this bill. The incompetence in the context of the bill that's before us is unbelievable. We have a range of amendments that we are proposing. Our amendments would go some way to dealing with the problems in this bill, but, Minister, can you explain why the focus is on the trade union movement and the other issues are ignored?</span>

You are also completely, totally and utterly wrong in relation to the inference that this bill targets unions. You will be aware that the bill clearly targets both employers and registered organisations. The bill is drafted to stop illegitimate payments between employers and employee organisations. The bill makes it an offence to both offer or provide and to solicit or receive a corrupting benefit. Therefore, an employer who offers or pays a corrupting benefit to an official will be guilty of the same offence as an official who requests or receives the benefit.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I will give you an example: payments made by an employer in the maritime industry totalling approximately $540,000 to the MUA, ostensibly for sponsorship of maritime industry conferences. The royal commission found that the payments were more likely made for industrial peace, as the company declined to have its logo displayed at the relevant conferences despite its sponsorship. In that case, the employer is as liable as the registered organisation that received the benefit. So, Senator Cameron, in response to your allegation that the bill only targets unions, you could not be more incorrect. The commissioner himself found that giving a payment and receiving a payment is as bad, and that is why the bill is clearly drafted to apply equally to registered organisations and employers.</span>

The Corporations Act imposes broad duties on officers and employees of constitutional corporations. Breaching these duties can give rise to criminal liability in respect of receiving corrupting benefits. This is in contrast to the duties imposed on union officials under the registered organisations act, which are presently limited to the financial management of the organisation. </span>

                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Under section 184, a director or officer commits an offence if they are reckless or intentionally dishonest and fail to exercise their powers or discharge their duties in good faith in the best interests of the corporation or for a proper purpose. Section 184 also makes it an offence for a director, officer or an employee to use their position dishonestly with the intention of gaining advantage for themselves or someone else. Section 79 of the Corporations Act extends liability to those who are involved in a contravention of these offences, so union officials bribing employers to act improperly could also be captured. Basically, in answer to your question, the situation of persons bribing directors and officers of other employers is already prohibited by the Commonwealth Corporations Act. </span>

The minister just is not capable of identifying the equivalence between the Corporations Act and the new penalties that are engaged in this bill. The Law Council itself has said clearly that this goes far too wide, that it is a bill that is unclear, that the penalties are not well defined and that people are not aware of some of the issues that they could face jail over. They were scathing about this bill. Do you have any comment, Minister, about the Law Council's concerns in relation to the bill? </span>

You would be aware that the issues raised by the Senate Standing Committee for the Scrutiny of Bills were dealt with in the normal way, and I responded in the normal way. Again, in relation to submissions that were made to the Senate inquiry, they were dealt with by the Senate inquiry and the Senate committee. The Senate committee recommended that the bill be passed.</span>

Everyone else who looked at the bill and all of the experts that looked at the bill—the eminent legal advisers to the Parliamentary Joint Committee on Human Rights, the eminent legal adviser to the Scrutiny of Bills Committee, the Law Council of Australia, the Australian Industry Group—said there are huge problems with this bill, but your defence is that simply the committee made a decision. That is pretty weak. I am not surprised, Chair, that the minister can't defend the bill as it has been drafted, because it was so badly drafted.</span>

That is an intention to influence. At the moment, the bill sets the test of intention for offering a bribe at 'intention of influencing', whereas the intention for receiving a bribe is 'intention to tend to influence'. Again, this is bad drafting. Again, this is a bill that has been rushed. Again, this is the result you get when you don't consult with people who actually know what they're talking about in this area. I'm not sure, Minister, whether you're prepared to accept amendment (8). If you are, maybe we can move that as well. </span>

In the first instance, the bill does apply the same level of culpability to both sides of a corrupting transaction, and the same penalties apply to both sides. The bill was drafted to use both the terms 'influence' and 'tend to influence'. There is no material difference between the two offences, and both involve the same kind of intention on the part of the defendant. However, for the benefit of the opposition, who have requested the clarification and that the same wording is used throughout the offence, the government is more than happy to support the amendment. </span>

Nothing like this happens anywhere else, in any operation across the country. The government determines what is proper. There is no limit anywhere in the corporate world or the professional world similar to this. This is why the minister won't accept these amendments—because they go to the fundamental rights of unions to operate unencumbered by influence from government. Free unions that operate all over the world do not have anything like this. This is a problem. This is overreach from this government. This is absolute overreach. As I have said, there is nowhere else in the corporate or professional world that this applies. It is extraordinary to single out an employer-registered organisation relationship in this way. It is subjecting people to serious criminal penalties, to the loss of liberty, for behaviour which is not dishonest or corrupt or improper. What's going on? The Ai Group was so concerned—that is, the employers were so concerned—with this legislation that in their submission to the Senate inquiry they called for the criminal penalties to be removed from the bill. That is, that the offence should not carry a maximum penalty of two years imprisonment but only a fine. The ACTU noted that these proposed offences have the potential to criminalise terms of enterprise agreements, made pursuant to Section 172 and approved by the Fair Work Commission, which relate to the relationship between employers and the employee organisation, terms which are perfectly proper and legal.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Another reason why this offence is to exist at all on the Commonwealth statute book is that it must be directed towards dishonest transfers of cash and benefits. If things are not dishonest, you should not go to jail for two years. But that is what this bill does. Professor Andrew Stewart supported the proposition of outlawing corrupting benefits, and Labor has said, 'We are not going to defend corruption.' But he said, in his submission: </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">The question, however, is whether the Bill achieves these objectives without creating undue uncertainty or having unnecessary consequences.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">So it has unnecessary consequences and it creates uncertainty. He goes on to say:</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">As the Bill stands, I believe its drafting fails on both those scores. The essential problem is that, rather than identify with some specificity the types of practice or arrangement that are to be outlawed, the Bill relies on overly broad prohibitions for which extensive exclusions must then be formulated.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">So it basically throws the net out and says that anything caught in that net, unless the government says it should not be kept in the net, is in the net. Professor Andrew Stewart, an acknowledged expert in this area, says it is 'overly broad'. He goes onto say: </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">Moving on to proposed ss 536F–536G, these create incredibly broad prohibitions on employers giving or being asked to give money, goods or services to a registered union or someone connected to such a union. In order to prevent these catching the most mundane and unremarkable of industrial arrangements, a series of exceptions are created. But it is far from clear that these operate as widely as they should.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">He is saying that the exemptions are not wide enough, so people will get caught for carrying out transactions with an employer that are legal. He goes on to say:</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">For example, an employer may decide to provide catering for a meeting, or to allow unions to use its information technology system to disseminate information to its members. It is not obvious that any of the stated exceptions would apply – yet surely these are not 'corrupting' benefits.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The government's stated purpose for these offences is to prevent corrupt or illegitimate payments. Therefore, these offences should have a fault element of dishonesty. So, if you are going to have a position where people can go to jail for two years, then they must have behaved dishonestly. This would ensure that the offence does not inadvertently criminalise benign conduct, including by employers. And the example given by the Law Council is of an employer who makes charitable donations at the suggestion of or following the example of a union. So for making a donation to charity, you could go to jail for two years under this legislation. What is wrong with this mob? This is just ideology gone mad. This is ideology that is determined to lock people up for two years, even if they don't commit a criminal offence.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The Law Council recommended the introduction of a fault element, and Labor agrees with the reasoning. The definition of dishonesty is imported from the Criminal Code so that the test of corrupt behaviour for officials of registered organisations and employers is the same as that which currently exists for Commonwealth officers. Senator Leyonhjelm has proposed amendments which, while going some way to addressing the serious concerns raised by the Senate Scrutiny of Bills Committee, do not resolve the core flaw with this offence. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This proposed offence, even with Senate Leyonhjelm's amendments, casts such a wide net in criminalising what are otherwise legal and proper payments between employer groups and unions—payments that this government has no problem with, if they are made between companies or between employers—is simply not something the chamber should support. It's simply not appropriate for this government to design a criminal offence which has serious ambiguity about what activities are and aren't covered and that has a real impact of criminalising perfectly normal activities carried out with no dishonest or improper intent and for which a person can be deprived of their liberty for two years. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">So the Scrutiny of Bills Committee, the Joint Committee on Human Rights, the Law Council and the legal experts that have looked at it—Professor Andrew Stewart. The unions and the employers say: 'This is wrong. This is bad. Don't do it.' Yet, we have heard that this minister is determined, for ideological reasons, to try and destroy the trade union movement to put these penalties in place that exist nowhere else in the form that they exist in this legislation. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">On that basis, I would ask the chamber to reject this bill, if it contains that proposal that would criminalise perfectly legal behaviour. We are asking that amendments (14) and (15) be supported by the chamber to go some of the way to resolving this terrible situation where you do not know what offence you might commit, and there is no certainty and you could end up going to jail for two years for an offence that is not a criminal offence.</span>

                      <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Senator CASH</span>
                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Western Australia</span>—<span class="HPS-MinisterialTitles">Minister Assisting the Prime Minister for the Public Service, Minister for Employment and Minister for Women</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">11:52</span>):  The government, as I have already articulated, will not be supporting these amendments. The government worked constructively with the crossbench and the shadow minister in relation to a number of amendments that we were pleased to accept to enhance the clarity of the bill. But, these particular amendments—(14) and (15)—go exactly to the heart of what the bill is doing. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The bill is unashamedly anticorruption and pro worker. Any payment being made between an employer and a union should only ever be for the benefit of the worker. That is why we have set out clearly in the bill those legitimate payments. For example, employers will be able to provide a payment to a union, if the payment is for membership fees or a legitimate wages deduction authorised by the employee. If the payment is intended to benefit the employers' employees, unlike what Senator Cameron has said, the bill clearly states that a legitimate payment is a genuine gift made to a deductible gift recipient. I think what Senator Cameron refuses in his comments is, under our bill, the payment must be a genuine gift; for goods and services supplied at market value, and supplied in the ordinary course of the organisation's business and the defendant's business; a payment made in accordance with Australian law; a payment made in accordance with a court or tribunal order, judgement or reward; or a non-corrupting payment provided in accordance with the regulations. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We will also accept the majority committee's recommendations that this list be updated, and I understand we have agreed to update those benefits. But let us be very, very clear here. This is why Labor does not support the bill as drafted and has proposed these amendments. Most of the corrupting benefits uncovered by the royal commission involved secret payments from employers to unions in return for industrial peace or, worse, conditions for workers. Let me be very, very clear: these payments and these deals do not involve dishonesty. That is the fundamental difference. These payments are made quite honestly between the employer and the union, but they are not for the benefit of the worker. In no way, if you are anti-corruption or pro-worker, can you ever say that they should fall within the legitimate payment exceptions.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I am going to now give the chamber some examples of payments that would be legitimised if these two amendments, because this is just what employers and unions do. They make honest payments between each other that do not benefit their workers. For example, $100,000 from Toll to TEACHO, a TWU entity, to secure an enterprise agreement with a promise to pay a further $50,000 for information about Toll's competitors—a secret payment made between the employer and the union that, under Labor's amendments, is absolutely legitimate. It is not. Those payments should never be allowed to be made. They are secret payments. They are corrupting payments, and both the employer and the union should face a penalty.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Then there is the example of $1 million from Saipem to the Maritime Employees Training Fund, an MUA entity. At the time Saipem was negotiating the use of foreign crude boats on a gas project in Darwin. Under Labor's amendments, this payment is a legitimate payment. The nearly $1 million from Dredging International to the MUA, apparently to secure an enterprise agreement, is, under Labor's amendments, a legitimate payment. Over $1 million from the employer Van Oord to the MUA to avoid industrial disputation is, under Labor's amendments, a legitimate payment. Over $210,000 from construction companies to a CFMEU ACT organiser in exchange for work in Canberra—'Let's break that cartel'—is, under Labor's amendments, a legitimate payment. Then there's over $400,000 from Thiess contractors to the AWU Workplace Reform Association—ironically or, should I say, not ironically, unfortunately controlled by then firm Bruce Wilson—in return for a good relationship with the union. The payments were siphoned into a slush fund controlled by Wilson who then used the money for his personal benefit. Under Labor's amendments, this is a legitimate payment.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The thousands of dollars from Ausreo to AWU Victoria, again, in return for a good relationship with the union, is a legitimate payment if these amendments pass. Thousands of dollars from Potters Industries to the AWU in Victoria, again in return for good relations with the union, is, under Labor's amendments, a legitimate payment. One that I think all Australians are aware of—and I would hope they hang their heads in shame at what occurred—is the $75,000 from the employer Cleanevent to the AWU in Victoria. Let's remind ourselves as to why the employer happily handed over the money to the AWU. Why? It was to maintain an enterprise agreement that paid cleaning workers well below award rates and stripped them of penalty rates, overtime and shift loadings. Entry-level casuals working at events were entitled to 176 per cent more per hour under the award than under the agreement that was negotiated by the employer and the union, who was meant to be acting in their best interests.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Unibilt gave $32,000 to Bill Shorten to fund his 2007 campaign for federal parliament. Chiquita Mushrooms gave $24,000 to the AWU Victoria to avoid industrial unrest while it was transitioning its mushroom-picking workforce to labour hire. What is worse in this case is the AWU falsely invoiced the payments as 'paid education leave' and never disclosed the payments to Chiquita employees. Employer Winslow Constructors gave $200,000 to the AWU Victoria for multiple benefits—including advanced notice of the terms of their competitor's enterprise agreement—and good relations with the AWU. Winslow also provided lists of employee names that were secretly signed up to the union. BMD construction gave $30,000 to the AWU Victoria—again, to secure industrial peace, but the employer also provided lists of employee names that were secretly signed up to the union.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The list of payments goes on and on and on. These payments were absolutely not made known to the employees. They were made quite honestly. There was an intention to provide the payment. There was nothing dishonest in making these payments, except for the fact that none of these payments, in any way, benefited the workers.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The government does oppose these amendments because they go to the heart of exactly what this bill is seeking to do: stop the corrupt payments between employers and unions, and ensure that any payment that is made between an employer and a union is a legitimate payment made for the benefit of the worker.</span>

                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">New South Wales</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">12:03</span>):  Where do you start with that diatribe? This is simply about principles in law. It's about legislation—actually applying principles fairly and evenly across the nation. This government will not accept these amendments, even though they've been exposed to have so badly drafted this bill that, in the minister's own words, she has had to accept 90 per cent of the amendments. But when it comes to treating the union movement differently from corporations, she is not prepared to move—not prepared to move.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This is about ensuring that workers and their unions get treated fairly, and this is not happening. It's not a coincidence that the ACTU and the employer organisations—Ai Group, one of the biggest employer organisations in the country—raised this issue as a fundamental problem. If you're going to push onto the trade union movement certain new laws that differ from the laws that apply employer to employer, then there is something wrong. The Scrutiny of Bills Committee recognised that. The Parliamentary Joint Committee on Human Rights, which has Liberal and National Party members, actually raised concerns about this, and they are advised by eminent lawyers who deal with these issues.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">What's happening here is that dishonesty underpins any breaches of the law if you're a government official. Dishonesty has to be proven if you're a member of parliament, but not if you're a union official—you don't have to prove dishonesty; you don't have to do that. This is a nonsense. This is a blatant attempt to further weaken the trade union movement from a government whose history in this place has been of attacking the trade union movement. I find it galling that this minister stands up and says she's acting in the interests of working people. This would be the first time, Minister, you ever have. It would be the first time I've ever seen you doing it.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">But you know that's not the truth; this is not about a government acting in the interests of working people. This is a government who introduced Work Choices. As soon as they had the opportunity and the numbers in this place, they set about diminishing the rights of ordinary workers, who lost their penalty rates, lost their annual leave loading and had their rates of pay cut under individual contracts championed by the coalition. That is what this government's about; let's not make any bones about that. As soon as this government gets a chance to diminish collective bargaining in this country, it sets about doing it. It never acted in the benefit of workers. It never has and still has not stood up for the 700,000 workers who are going to lose penalty rates as a result of the decision of the Fair Work Commission after the commission was bullied by coalition members who were out there calling for penalty rate cuts for months, if not years, before that decision was taken. Nor has the Prime Minister. This is a Prime Minister who is so weak that he cannot effectively run his own government, a Prime Minister that is so jelly backed that he has to give in to a former Prime Minister and some of the most extreme members of the government, a Prime Minister who is a captive of Deputy Prime Minister Barnaby Joyce, a Prime Minister who has given up any semblance of standing up for his principles.</span>

                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">When you have a weak Prime Minister and a government that is ideologically driven, you end up with a situation like this: 90 per cent of this legislation has had to be changed when it has been subject to scrutiny and analysis by the opposition. This is bad legislation. It's designed to ensure that ordinary working people do not have access to effective trade unions. It's about ensuring that trade unions are treated differently from employers. It's about ensuring that trade unions are treated differently from members of parliament. We have to act dishonestly before we would end up going to jail, and government officials would have to act dishonestly before they end up going to jail, but not for a trade union official under this legislation. I would appeal to the crossbenchers not to fall for what's been put by the minister. Every expert that's looked at this—either scrutiny of bills, human rights or the Law Council of Australia—who put in a submission on this bill, then wrote to the Labor Party and said to shadow minister Mr O'Connor that our amendments were consistent with the submissions that they put.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">It is absolutely essential, for the fair operation of the law in this country and for everyone to be treated equally under the law in this country, that these amendments are accepted because it's creating different classes of organisations under the law. And it just so happens that it's the Liberal and National parties that are treating the trade union movement differently from everyone else in the country. If you're a corporation, you're not faced with this. If you're a corrupt public servant, you're not faced with this. If you're a corrupt member of parliament, you're not faced with this. What it means is that people operating within the law can end up going to jail for two years. This is, despite all that the minister has said, treating people differently under the law, depending on what organisation they're in. If you're the Commonwealth Bank, you don't have to worry about anything like this. If you're Westpac, you don't have to worry about anything like this. If you're a corrupt public servant, you don't have to worry about anything like this. And we know what happens around the world when governments impose politically and ideologically based legislation on the rights of working people to organise. It means that workers' wages fall; it means that rights at work fall. You can't get any dignity at work; you cannot operate effectively as a trade union movement in this country. </span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">So this is bad law, this is unequal law, and it should be rejected. I would ask the crossbenchers to support the amendments that we have put, because it means that everyone will be treated fairly and equally under the law. This does not achieve that.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The Fair Work Act, with its minimum wages, its unfair dismissal law and its inordinate red tape, is preventing hundreds of thousands of Australians from getting a job. It's a cause of sheer misery. My party, the Liberal Democrats, would abolish the Fair Work Act. As a result, employers would not be forced to negotiate with unions and the artificial power of unions to extract kickbacks would disappear. </span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">While the Fair Work Act remains, the Liberal Democrats support the government's attempt to ban kickbacks. As such, we support the intention of the government's Fair Work Amendment (Corrupting Benefits) Bill 2017. However, in its exuberance to attack union kickbacks, the government has forgotten the liberal values that underpin Western civilisation. One of these liberal values is the principle that the criminal law by which a person can be put in jail should be determined by the parliament. The government's bill violates this principle by seeking to empower the minister to expand a criminal offence by issuing a regulation. </span>

It is true that a regulation expanding this criminal offence would be disallowable by the Senate. But, if a disallowance vote was tied, the regulation would remain. The criminal offence would be expanded, despite the government not achieving a parliamentary majority in support of such an expansion. This is undemocratic.

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The remaining amendments on sheet 8191 remove strict liability. Under strict liability, a defendant can be found guilty of some harm, even if the defendant did not intend to cause harm and was not reckless about the risk of harm. The defendant can try to keep out of jail by claiming a relevant excuse, but the onus for proving this excuse would rest with the defendant. It is illiberal to put blameless people in jail and to treat someone as guilty until proven innocent. The reversal of the onus of proof is contrary to the most fundamental premise of the Australian legal system. The government has a criminal law policy that an offence punishable by imprisonment should not be an offence of strict liability. Unfortunately, the government somehow forgot its own policy and proposed a strict liability offence as punishable by up to two years for when an employer provides a benefit to a relevant a union official. Through my amendments, an employer or union official will only go to jail if they intended this to happen or are reckless about the risk. This is how it should be. </span>

Fundamental to its success is the rule of law, where we are innocent until proven guilty and where only the blameworthy can be denied their liberty and thrown in jail, rather than just people the ruling powers do not like.

This doesn't go far enough. It doesn't protect the trade union movement. It doesn't protect working people. If that's the best you can do, Senator, I suppose that's the best you can do.

I do indicate that the government will be supporting amendments (2) and (3) and items (1) and (4). We are of the view that Senator Leyonhjelm's amendments are reasonable alternatives that are consistent with the purpose and intent of the legislation. I don't think it will come as a surprise to anyone in this place that the regulation-making powers in the bill are, as they are in many Commonwealth acts, designed to allow for developments in law or practice that affect relevant provisions of the bill. Again we are happy to accept the amendment in relation to the changes, and it will be the existing list of legitimate payments in the bill.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This amendment changes the definition of 'related party' in relation to the new requirements to make disclosures during negotiations of enterprise agreements. The bill imposes disclosure requirements during the negotiation of enterprise agreements where a proposed term of an agreement will give either the union or the employer a financial benefit. The bill requires the union to disclose any potential benefits from an enterprise agreement that may flow to a related party, which, as currently defined, is an extended, unreasonable list of people and entities. The amendment defines 'related party' clearly and precisely as the branch or branches of the organisation which the members of the organisation—that is, the bargaining representatives—are members of, an officer of that branch, an entity controlled by the organisation, or a spouse of a divisional committee of management provided that an officer of the branch referred to in paragraph (a) is also a member of such committee. Again this is overreach. The amendment is needed to make this bill consistent with all the expert advice to the committee and the minister.</span>

This amendment actually has the effect of limiting disclosure and transparency. What is being proposed by the opposition would prevent workers from finding out what benefits are flowing to those closely associated with their union—for example, payments made to a company run by a union boss. It would hide from workers the kinds of payments the royal commission uncovered that were regularly being made by employers to slush funds that were actually controlled by union bosses. We on this side of the chamber believe that these payments should be disclosed, as should payments to any legitimate entity controlled by a union official that is receiving payments from the employer. Again, this amendment will have the effect of limiting the disclosure and transparency that I would hope we're all trying to achieve. </span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">In terms of the definition of 'related party' that is currently in the bill: it is an existing concept and it has been taken from the Fair Work (Registered Organisations) Act 2009. This is nothing new. There really is no credible argument for deviating from that definition. Again, the effect of the amendment would be that you may end up creating legal loopholes, particularly for employer organisations. This is because much of the proposed definition of 'related party' hinges on the existence of a branch of an organisation, whereas not all organisations are actually defined by 'branches'. This is a significant deficiency that we would not support, as the bill should apply equally to disclosure by unions and employer organisations.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The reason is obvious: we need to tighten this inadvertent loophole. We need to stop corrupt or corruptible union bosses and companies from continuing to steal from honest union members and honest workers. We need to stop the cabal of large companies, employers and union bosses from hurting small businesses and we need to protect the taxpayers.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Yesterday I discussed some examples. Here are some more. Chiquita Mushrooms paid the AWU Victoria $24,000 to avoid industrial unrest while it was transitioning its mushroom picking workforce to labour hire. The AWU falsely invoiced the payments as paid education leave and never disclosed the payments to the Chiquita employees—the very people they were steal the money from and supposed to be supporting. Winslow Constructors paid the AWU Victoria around $200,000 and provided the union with lists of employee names that were used to secretly sign up employees to the union. In return, the AWU provided Winslow with advanced notice of the terms of a competitor's enterprise agreement, giving them a competitive advantage. The AWU hid the payments behind false invoices for OH&amp;S training, health and safety training, workplace inspections and similar. This is why we need this amendment.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">BMD Constructions paid the AWU—there it is again, AWU Victoria—more than $30,000 and provided the union with a list of employee names that was used to secretly sign up employees to the union. The payments were made around the time of enterprise agreement negotiations and appeared to be a move to secure industrial peace. In 1992, the Gyles royal commission found that employers made numerous corrupt or improper payments to union bosses associated with the NSW branch of the Building Workers Industrial Union. These payments were apparently made to secure industrial peace and good relations with the union. And on and on it goes. Union bosses are now a law unto themselves in some unions. That's unlawful. They are outlaws.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Labor and the Greens are simply protecting their cash flow from corrupt union bosses. We need to tighten the wording to protect union members and their money from corrupt companies and union bosses. I commend this amendment.</span>

These amendments clarify what kinds of payments will be considered to be legitimate payments for the purposes of the offence. The insertion of the term 'directly' in relation to benefits to employees clarifies that employees must see an immediate and explicit benefit. The insertion of the term 'reasonable' in relation to membership fees clarifies that a payment ostensibly for membership fees cannot be exorbitant and used as a means of achieving the malintent outlawed by this bill. The government supports the amendments on the basis that they provide further clarity as to what qualifies as a legitimate payment under the bill.</span>

                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Queensland</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">12:44</span>):  Here's the empirical evidence. In 2003 The Cole royal commission found instances where employers made improper payments to unions that were disguised as donations, often through the use of false invoices or false contracts. The payments were made to maintain industrial peace or achieve employers' objectives. That is not reasonable.</span>

There is a clear difference, and if you put a limit on membership fees that means I think this would be in breach of ILO conventions. Unions are entitled to operate free from undue government interference. It doesn't happen much in this country, but this is a big problem. Workers will suffer because of this One Nation coalition axis. This is not good.</span>

                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Senator REYNOLDS</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Western Australia</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">12:45</span>):  Australia is a close and longstanding partner to Papua New Guinea. Papua New Guinea is a country that I have visited many times over the last decade and I have come to develop a great affection for. From the 25 to 30 June, I had the great privilege of representing the Australian government as one of four Australian observers to the 2017 PNG elections.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I would like to start by warmly congratulating Papua New Guinea on the successful conduct of their ninth election since independence. I also congratulate all 111 successful candidates who were elected, and also Peter O'Neill on his re-election as Prime Minister. I was accompanied by my Senate colleague, Senator Moore, and also MPs, Andrew Laming and Cathy McGowan. I spent my time between two provinces. The first was the Eastern Highlands and the second was the Gulf Province—two very rich and wonderfully diverse communities and societies with two very different approaches to democratic elections.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">This observer mission demonstrates Australia's commitment to supporting Papua New Guinea's democracy and the observations of all four of us will inform Australia's ongoing support to strengthen PNG's electoral systems. Geographic proximity and also our deep historical ties have given Papua New Guinea a very special place in Australia's foreign relations, and our bilateral relationship is certainly one of the most complex and wide-ranging with any nation. We are increasingly working together to strengthen governance in line with PNG's own policy priorities. Australia's official development assistance to PNG last financial year was over $500 million.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Having supported Australian programs—this is myself—to encourage female candidates, but also to strengthen political parties in PNG, on a very personal level this election provided mixed results in both areas. It was wonderful to see the evolution of political party administration and professionalism in Papua New Guinea. I would like to congratulate my friend, Dr Alphonse Gelu, for his tireless commitment to this cause over many years. But it was personally very disappointing to see that not a single woman will now sit in the PNG's next parliament. For this election, Australia provided training for a quarter of all female candidates standing for election in Papua New Guinea. That is 42 out of 165 women who stood at this election.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I would like to take this time to commend the outgoing female members of parliament, Delilah Gore, Julie Soso and also Loujaya Kouza for the important contribution they have made to Papua New Guinea's democracy, and I have no doubt that they will continue the work in encouraging more women to stand, and be in a position to win, in five years' time.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Our longstanding support for the Papua New Guinea Electoral Commission has also helped enable implementation of practical measures for women who are voting, and to do so in a way that is unimpeded by others at the booth. One of those in particular was the advent of a separate line for men and women going into the polling booth. I was very pleased to see at most of the polling places I went to that this was observed—in a number of different ways, but it was observed—and I think it was of benefit to a number of the women who were seeking to exercise a free vote.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Papua New Guinea is without question an endlessly fascinating and complex nation where locals will always tell you to expect the unexpected. On my return from Papua New Guinea, I was more convinced than ever that Australians would benefit from a bit more of the spirit of Papua New Guineans. That is, a spirit, a passion, for democracy. I think all of us here in Australia would be far better from a little bit more of that spirit of Papua New Guinea, and not being afraid of having robust and passionate debates of issues of importance and importance to our democracy.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The Papua New Guineans whom I know, my friends, all have wonderful senses of humour, a generosity of spirit, deep religious beliefs and a great love of and connection to family and to tribal lands. One of the things that I greatly admire in Papua New Guineans is that, over centuries, they have developed the ability to robustly and respectfully debate important issues within their communities but also then accept a consensus community decision. The tough subsistence living of so many, which I again witnessed on this visit, is unimaginable to most Australians today. But it does make Papua New Guineans an incredibly resilient and endlessly patient society. With over 1,000 tribes and 800 language groups, they also mostly manage cultural and ethnic diversity very well, albeit still with the occasional clan and tribal skirmishes. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Ultimately, however, what unites the nation of Papua New Guinea is a deep love for family, community, rugby and participating in elections. It unites the entire nation. Despite the well-documented problems with the administration and conduct of the election, there has been a result, and PNG democracy will continue to survive, but I believe it will evolve in a very distinctly Papua New Guinean fashion. In a way, what I saw there was that it is evolving and adapting classical democratic concepts and processes and merging them with tribal traditions to meet their own needs and requirements in the 21st century. I definitely saw this in action in a number of communities in the Eastern Highlands. All of this is not to underplay the significants socio-economic challenges Papua New Guinea still faces. PNG society, like society elsewhere in the world, is changing. Urbanisation is putting strain on traditional cultural values and family and societal structures, norms and support. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Responsibility for delivering this election lies with the Papua New Guinean government. In line with the Papua New Guinean electoral processes, and the expectations of the Papua New Guinean people, the PNG Electoral Commission was led by Commissioner Gamato, who I have to say had a very challenging role in delivering this election. Australia worked very closely with PNG to support the delivery of this election, including assisting the Papua New Guinea Electoral Commission with wide-ranging logistical support and training of electoral staff. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The Papua New Guinean terrain and the dispersal of communities mean that it is one of the most logistically challenging locations in the world in which to conduct an election. I was very proud, when I was up there, to see the ADF helping with transport. They transported over 90 tonnes of material, nearly 1,000 local election staff and over 600 members of the Papua New Guinea Defence Force who were involved in election delivery. It was great to see over 200 Australian personnel up there, quietly but very effectively providing air assets to transport materials and people to over 18 airfields—some of the most challenging to get to in the world. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I had the pleasure and the honour of meeting with the ADF personnel deployed on Operation Hannah, the ADF's contribution to supporting the PNG elections. I was honoured meet with Operation Hannah headquarters staff at Murray Barracks and thank them for the valuable work they were doing to contribute to Papua New Guinean democracy. The operation also, significantly for Australia, provided an environmental understanding for us in the lead-up to APEC 2018 and the Bougainville referendum, which we are committed to supporting. That the ADF was able to undertake such a significant operation overseas whilst simultaneously delivering effectively all other overseas operational deployments, but also Exercise Talisman Sabre, is a real testament to the enhanced operational capabilities of today's ADF. I congratulate them all. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I would like to finish by thanking Heather Murphy from DFAT, who was my liaison officer throughout the observer mission. She succeeded in not losing a senator in the highlands of Papua New Guinea. I thank her very much for that and for her professionalism and commitment. I also thank the High Commissioner, Bruce Davis, and the Deputy High Commissioner, Bronte Moules, both of whom provide very professional and very wonderful support. They do Australia proud, they and their team, in their support of the Australian government in Papua New Guinea.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The Australian government looks forward to a productive working relationship with Prime Minister O'Neill and Papua New Guinea's new government and parliament. I wish the new government well. I will do all I can personally to support the Australian government's continued work with the Papua New Guinea Electoral Commission to further strengthen electoral administration, particularly in relation to voter identification; to strengthen the integrity of the common roll; and, of course, to work with their women.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Tasmania</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">12:55</span>):  Early in my working career, I was employed as an early childhood educator. I worked in childcare centres and then I ran my own family day care business. While the profession used to be simply referred to as 'child care', it was in those times that the title 'early childhood educator' was adopted. It was adopted to recognise that there is a much broader role for workers in this industry. We are not just carers but also skilled educators who help young children to learn and develop. We understand that learning begins from birth and that those who provide professional care for children while their parents are working or studying have a huge responsibility for that learning. As skilled professional educators, we understand a great deal about childhood development. As a former early childhood educator with over a decade of experience, I feel qualified to make some comments about the transition from early childhood education to school.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">There's a debate going on right now in my home state of Tasmania about a state government proposal to lower the school starting age by half a year. This proposal is a bad idea for many, many reasons. It's bad for schools, it's bad for the early childhood education and care sector, and, most importantly, it's bad for the children. The Tasmanian government education minister, Jeremy Rockliff, claimed that their proposal would bring Tasmania's school starting age into line with other jurisdictions. This is simply not true. An analysis of school starting ages commissioned by the Australian Childcare Alliance shows that if the proposal went ahead Tasmania would have the lowest compulsory school starting age in Australia. This would be despite having the highest precompulsory school enrolment in Australia—that is, an enrolment in what we call kindergarten of 98 per cent, equal only to the ACT. While Western Australia, the Northern Territory and the Australian Capital Territory have similar compulsory school starting ages to Tasmania, their preschool/kinder programs are offered through early education and care services, not in schools.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">Under this proposal, Tasmanian children would enter a formal school environment a full year before most of their mainland counterparts. Unlike early childhood education, school-based kindergarten programs do not provide 3½-year-olds with the kind of play-based learning that they require. I want to make it clear that I'm not criticising Tasmania's highly qualified and hard-working teachers, but they've studied and gained their teaching qualifications in the expectation that they would be teaching a particular age cohort—that is, children who are ready for school, not children who belong in early education and care services. Now, a lot of people think there is little difference between the ages 3½ and four, but this is a period of rapid development for children, especially when you consider those developmental changes across a classroom of 15 or 20 students. In Tasmania, it's quite often more. This presents the challenge of teachers having to supervise more young children who, because of their age, have a shorter attention span or cannot go to the toilet unattended—tasks which early childhood educators are trained to deal with.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">If the government's proposal goes ahead, teachers will need more resources to help them in the classrooms. Granted, the state government has allocated funding for this initiative, but it's funding that could be better directed to initiatives that make a positive difference to educational outcomes. For example, why not direct the funding to reducing teacher-to-student ratios, providing more one-on-one support for children with disability or learning difficulties, or reinstating pathway planners? So, while the lower school starting age proposal would put a strain on Tasmania's education budget, it will also have a devastating impact on the early childhood education and care sector. Taking thousands of children out of early childhood education and placing them in formal schooling will lead to many childcare centres becoming unviable and being forced to close, particularly in regional areas. Analysis by the sector's peak body, Early Childhood Australia, found that upwards of 500 early childhood educator jobs could be lost as a result of this proposal. Lowering the age that children go to school would also lower the average age of children enrolled in child care. And because there is a requirement for higher staff ratios for younger children, childcare fees would increase significantly. Modelling by the Australian Childcare Alliance shows that fees could as much as double in some centres due to their high fixed costs and the loss of this more profitable age group. While those parents whose children have entered school early might save on childcare fees, the cost will be borne by those parents whose children remain enrolled in child care.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I've mentioned the impact this proposal would have on schools and early childhood and care sector, but an even more important reason I oppose this policy is that it is just simply bad for the children. Prominent author and child psychologist Steve Biddulph wrote in an opinion editorial in the <span style="font-style:italic;">Mercury</span> of Hobart last year that research overwhelmingly supports a later school starting age of around six or seven years of age. He pointed out that around 88 per cent of the world starts school at around this age, and that:</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Small">Australia as a whole is out of step with the world, and our State Government is seeking to make that worse.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Among the reasons against starting children at school too young is that they find sitting at a desk for long periods uncomfortable, and their motor skills and executive function are generally less well-developed than older children. Mr Biddulph's view is backed up by a study from Stanford University, which found that children who started kindergarten at the age of six had much better self-control than those who were enrolled at five. In Queensland, suspensions of children who are five years old and under have doubled in three years—suspensions! And more children are being referred to support services for ADHD.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The Tasmanian government's proposal has been roundly condemned, not only by childhood development academics and experts like Mr Biddulph but by the early childhood education sector and many parents and teachers. With the weight of evidence against this proposal and so much opposition to it, I cannot understand why the Tasmanian government is persisting with this misguided and ill-thought-out plan. The only possible reason I can think of is that they have invested so much political capital in it that they have no dignified way of retreating from it completely. Minister Rockliff has at least managed a partial retreat, I will give him that. In August last year, the education minister changed his proposal to allow parents the choice of whether to send their children to school early. This is possibly worse than the original plan. I know the idea of giving choice to parents sounds like a good one, but it places an incredible burden on them. Some parents may feel quite comfortable about making the decision, but many others have told me that they are already feeling anxious about it. They are asking themselves: 'What do I base my decision on? Where do I seek advice about what's right for my child, and what if I get it wrong?' If they get it wrong, it can have huge social impacts on those children. In particular, low-income families may be influenced in their decision by financial pressures, as has been pointed out by educational psychologist Professor Andrew Martin from the University of Sydney. As Professor Martin said:</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Small">Low socio-economic students may be disproportionately more likely to be entered early so their parents, for example, can get to work.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The results of different parents making different decisions will be classrooms with children more than a year apart in age, and the gap will be even wider in combined prep and kinder classes, where children could be up to three years apart in their abilities. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">In the early years, children progress in their learning and development very rapidly. It is clearly unacceptable to have three-year-old children in a classroom with children six years of age. How could one teacher or even two teachers possibly supervise a class of children spanning ages three to six? And let's remember, a lot of three-year-olds still have a sleep throughout the day. How could they possibly give those children the attention they need, tailoring various curriculum programs to each age group? Without individual attention, this age gap will compound the problem of children becoming anxious and disengaged, because they struggle to keep up with the older peers. This age gap and disadvantage could potentially continue throughout a child's entire school life.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">
                  <span style="font-style:italic;" />The Tasmanian state Labor opposition is firmly against this proposal, and I believe their position is in step with the majority of the Tasmanian community. This opposition was reconfirmed last month when I spoke to, and seconded, a motion carried unanimously by Labor's state conference against lowering the school starting age. I cannot imagine many Australians would agree that a three-and-a-half-year-old child is old enough to begin school. Since the government is ignoring the community and ignoring the evidence, the power is in the hands of Tasmania's Legislative Council, so I hope they're listening and I hope, for the sake of Tasmania's children, that they make the right decision. I will continue to speak up against this ill-considered and short-sighted proposal until it is dropped by the government. <span style="font-style:italic;">(Time expired)</span></span>

                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Senator WHISH-WILSON</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Tasmania</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">13:05</span>):  The MP citizenship issue has been a significant matter of public interest in recent weeks. I was personally devastated by the news that Scott Ludlam and Larissa Waters resigned from parliament over issues with dual citizenship. These two people—indeed, friends of mine—have served the party and the country with distinction and brought so much to this chamber. I'd like to pay tributes to both of them, and I certainly hope to see them back in this place one day.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Scott, Larissa and our leader Richard Di Natale have brought great credit on themselves and on the Greens in how they have dealt with this question with complete integrity, openness and grace. This is in stark contrast to the Liberal-National Party and, today, One Nation, who have announced they will refer Senator Roberts to the Court of Disputed Returns, but only after the Greens and others had forced the issue.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I came under public scrutiny over my citizenship because my parents were in Singapore when I was born, as my father was serving in the Australian Air Force during the Vietnam War. However, because of Singaporean law—where you can only become a citizen of Singapore if you have one Singaporean parent—there was no way I could have inadvertently become a Singaporean citizen. Despite this, like many in this place, I was under a lot of media and constituent pressure to publicly provide documentation on my citizenship status. So I sought advice, records and a statement from the Australian High Commission and the Singaporean High Commission and have provided this to the media.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I have been open with my documentation. I also know that Senator Di Natale has been open about his, but it has been brought to my attention that one person in this chamber has not been willing to clear up public speculation and doubts about their efforts to rid themselves of dual citizenship when they were duly first elected: Senator Eric Abetz.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We know that Eric Abetz was once a German citizen. We know that he is now no longer a German citizen. What we don't know is whether—or how long—he sat in this chamber before he rid himself of his dual citizenship. It could've been anything up to 16 years. We don't know whether he took all reasonable steps to renounce his German citizenship before he took his place in the Senate. He has previously said he would publicly release documentation, but I understand he has not done so.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The government has been very vocal in the media about Larissa and Scott. It is only fair to subject senators on the government's side of the chamber to the same scrutiny—in fact, all senators. This is why we have moved for a general AEC audit of all sitting senators' and MPs' citizenship records and status. Given Labor and Liberal are disappointingly not likely to support this motion, it would then be a simple matter for Senator Abetz to clear up this issue by publicly providing the documentation about the steps he took to end his citizenship. This would be easy to do and would put him above doubt, which we all must be. I ask him to come to this chamber and do so.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Now, onto Venezuela. Since I last spoke on the issue in June, Venezuela has taken further steps away from democracy and towards chaos. With the establishment of a so-called constituent assembly, the Venezuelan President, Mr Maduro, has effectively set the stage to perpetuate himself in power at the expense of Venezuelan democracy and the human rights of the Venezuelan people. Many international human rights groups, like Amnesty International and Human Rights Watch, have condemned the constituent assembly, as have governments from around the world, including Venezuela's Latin American neighbours and the European Union.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">There are many concerns with a constituent assembly, and I will outline some of the most egregious aspects here. It is entirely made up of ruling party loyalists, including the President's own wife. It's impossible to ascertain the truth regarding the voter turnout given there were no independent observers and the media were, generally, not allowed to get close to the voting centres. But it's widely believed that turnout was low. Millions of Venezuelans had previously expressed their opposition to the proposal through a plebiscite on 16 July. It has the power to stop the national assembly—Venezuela's democratically elected parliament—from operating. Indeed, the new body is meeting where the opposition-controlled assembly holds its sessions. It removed the Attorney-General, Luisa Ortega Diaz, from her position in one of its first decisions. Ms Ortega was once a government loyalist, but, more recently, she has been a critic.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The chair of Transparency International, Jose Ugaz, said:</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Small">Without an autonomous judiciary that provides for checks and balances to the government, democracy is impossible. The lack of an independent Attorney General Office in Venezuela will result in even more impunity for illicit enrichment in a country where corruption is already rampant.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Indeed, Venezuela ranks amongst the most corrupt nations on the planet. It can indefinitely suspend elections. Elections for governors, which were supposed to take place last year, are now scheduled for December 2017. Presidential elections should take place in 2018. It will be critical to ensure that elections proceed as planned. That is not to mention the fact that the assembly itself is unconstitutional. Instead of holding a plebiscite to ask voters whether they approved of his plan, as experts generally agree is required, Maduro did it through a presidential decree. And I note that previous the President, Chavez, held a plebiscite on changing the country's constitution, which was defeated and which didn't go ahead.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">In addition to the establishment of the constituent assembly and the sacking of the Attorney-General, on Sunday 20 people in military uniforms attacked a military base and stole weapons. The attackers said they wanted to save the country from total destruction, but this is a very disturbing development, especially in light of international experts' concerns that Venezuela will slide into civil war with devastating consequences for the instability of the region and, of course, for human rights. This attack is an example of the increasing chaos in Venezuela. I call on all sides, both government and opposition, to deplore violence and stand up against human rights abuses and to move towards restoring democratic processes. Given the violence and deaths that we are seeing on our TV screens—and it is increasingly being covered here in Australia and in newspapers—the violence seems to be progressively worsening. I have met with a number of Venezuelans living in Australia, including in Tasmania and in Melbourne. They are all good people and they have very, very grave concerns for their families and loved ones back in Venezuela. It's on their behalf that I stand here today and represent this issue in the Australian parliament.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">With the last few minutes I have left, I would like to quickly touch on <span style="font-style:italic;">Four Corners</span>' stunning expose on the waste and recycling industry in Australia in recent days. This is a problem that has been a long time coming. My first senator's statement in here five years ago was how we need to tackle waste issues in this country, especially the issue of marine waste. I said in that senator's statement that it was one of the key reasons I came to parliament. Every Senate estimates I have repeatedly pushed the government to do something on this issue. Time and time again, they have stonewalled. The federal coalition has completely stalled our national waste policy. They abolished the COAG Standing Council on Environment and Water. They have not issued a national waste report in four years. They have not issued a single policy objective. They have vacated this space. The result is that the recycling industry is now in crisis, and public trust is sure to follow.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Last night, the ABC reported that the New South Wales regulator was recorded joking with industry about stopping his own government from introducing a plastic bag ban. This is no laughing matter, but it is what we are up against. It suggests that even when conservative ministers such as in New South Wales want to do something on this significant matter of public importance, the industry and regulators have got in the way. The environment minister must act now to save the industry and help restore public faith by recommitting the federal government to developing a national waste policy, including binding, mandatory national targets.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The Greens support the Senate Environment and Communications References Committee's recommendations. I note there was no dissent across the political divide. I very much respect the work that Senator Back did in that committee. There is the call for the federal government to step in and legislate for a national container deposit scheme and plastic bag ban if the states have failed to act by 2019. We also desperately need mandatory product stewardship schemes for a range of problematic waste streams, including tyres, mattresses, paints, batteries and other electronic equipment.</span>

                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Senator IAN MACDONALD</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Queensland</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">13:17</span>):  Today I want to talk about two significant industries in what we all know and acknowledge and agree is the best part of Australia, and that is northern Australia—in particular, northern Queensland. There would be no-one in this chamber who would argue with that description. The two industries in the north of Queensland in particular that I want to talk about are the tourism industry and the banana industry. In the tourism industry, I particularly want to talk about a wonderful feature called Paronella Park, which is otherwise called 'The story of a Spaniard's dream'.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Before I get to that, I want to briefly mention another great Australian industry, and that is the banana industry, which is centred principally around Tully, Innisfail, some parts of the Atherton Tablelands and up further, at Lakeland in the north of Queensland. In doing that, I wish to correct a misstatement I made previously when I told the chamber that Australians consume five million bananas each and every day. I was wrong in saying that and I want to correct the record. I'm told by the industry that it's actually six million bananas each and every day.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">

              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">

                    <span class="HPS-MemberContinuation">Senator IAN MACDONALD:</span>
                  </a>  It's a wonderful statistic. But when you think of the uses bananas are put to and the way they are readily consumed by most Australians—particularly young Australians—you can understand that that statistic of six million bananas being consumed in Australia each and every day of the year is accurate. For young people, of course, when parents pack a lunch for the kids to take to school, a banana has in-built wrapping—it comes in its own wrapping facility. And, of course, it is wonderfully tasteful. Not long ago, the industry in the north achieved a Guinness record of having the world's longest banana split. It was something that happened as a new world record of 8.04 kilometres. That's a pretty big banana split.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">It's a great industry. It employs a lot of people in tropical North Queensland. It's well run and well managed. They obviously do have their difficulties with diseases and importations but, by and large, it's a wonderful industry. Along with Senator O'Sullivan, I had the pleasure of attending the annual banana growers' conference during the break and saw firsthand the wonderful things they are doing: the way they are farming so sustainably; the way they have a concern about the environment in which they work; the sustainability, marketability, and future of their industry. All congratulations to the Australian banana growers on what they do. I thank them for their hosting of the banana growers' conference and wish them all the best in the future.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The other industry in North Queensland that I particularly want to highlight today is the tourism industry. There are so many wonderful aspects of the tourism industry in North Queensland that it would take more than 10 minutes—in fact, more than 10 hours—to properly detail them. In what is wrongly called the 'break' over the last month or so, I was in the area of Tully and the Atherton Tableland. I had been up to a local government conference at Yungaburra and Atherton, and that was followed by a meeting with the Mareeba Shire Council and the Mayor, Councillor Tom Gilmore. It was more than a meeting; I actually opened a facility of theirs. I've done a lot of openings in my time, and some of them were pretty schmick sorts of openings, but this was the opening of a sewerage plant—not quite as glamorous as many of the other openings I do. But, thanks to the Minister for Regional Development, Senator Nash, who happens to be in the chamber, $5 million was made available through the Stronger Regions Fund, which Senator Nash administers, to the Mareeba Shire Council to do this new sewerage plant, which will stop run-off of effluent contaminating some of the gulf rivers. It is visionary and provides for the future.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">On the way home from those parts of the Atherton Tableland, I thought it was time I again went to have a look at a wonderful venue called Paronella Park. For those who are not aware of this, Paronella Park is a Spaniard's dream. It is a Spanish castle built in the rainforest. A man named Jose Paronella arrived in Innisfail in 1913, having sailed from Catalonia in northern Spain, to plan a splendid life for himself and his fiancee, Matilda. He worked for eleven years—cutting cane, I might say, in those days—and created some wealth for himself. He then went home with the intention of getting Matilda to join him in Australia. He was going to build for Matilda this wonderful Spanish castle in the middle of the rainforest at Mena Creek just outside Innisfail, on the backroad between Innisfail and Tully. Unfortunately, in the long time Jose had been in Australia, Matilda thought he was never coming back and married someone else. Never mind, Jose married the sister, brought her back and then built this magnificent Spanish castle right in the middle of the rainforest.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">It has had a chequered history over the years. In the prewar and immediate postwar years it was the social venue for anyone in that part of North Queensland. It had a ballroom and a theatre. It is on the banks of Mena Creek, which is a fast-flowing waterfalled creek in that part of tropical North Queensland. It is a magnificent site right in the middle of the rainforest. In the middle of that he built this Spanish castle with turrets, walkways and a love tunnel. It's really interesting.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Over the years it became a tourist attraction. Following Cyclone Larry and Cyclone Yasi it fell into disrepair and the jungle started to take over. Since then two very enterprising people, Judy and Mark Evans, acquired Paronella Park and have restored much of the property. They have improved the surrounds and the grounds. They have wonderful tours through there. While I am at it I want to thank Pablo, the young Spaniard, who conducted the tour we took when we visited that place. They've turned this around so it is a very successful tourist attraction in tropical North Queensland. Not only do Mark and Judy Evans own Paronella Park and all that goes with it; they own the old hotel across the road, the caravan park and the skywalk through the forest not far away. They have done a wonderful job. They employ 80 people. They tell me that, if they did not have to pay the payroll tax they pay to the Queensland government, they could employ another two people.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">It is a wonderful enterprise. Mark and Judy Evans have done a wonderful job not only in restoring Paronella Park, the castle and the grounds, but in building a real tourist enterprise that provides real jobs for 80 of my fellow North Queenslanders. I congratulate them on all they have done. Any senator who happens to be up that way—if there is a committee meeting up that way—should take time off and travel the hour or so from Cairns to see Paronella Park. It would be well worth their while.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">
                  <a href="112096" type="MemberSpeech">
                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Senator LINES</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Western Australia</span>—<span class="HPS-MinisterialTitles">Deputy President and Chair of Committees</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">13:27</span>):  Today I want to talk about the custody notification service that has operated in New South Wales and the ACT for quite some time. It's a program that provides 24-hour legal advice for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people if and when they are taken into police custody. It was set up in New South Wales and the ACT in 2000. It followed one of the recommendations and the model that was outlined in the Royal Commission into Aboriginal Deaths in Custody. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">It has been about two years since I have spoken in this place about the custody notification system, or the CNS. It was under threat at one point. The New South Wales government was going to cease funding it. After quite a battle the federal government put some money in and the New South Wales government, I am very pleased to say, continued the service.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Why is it so important? Since its operation in New South Wales and the ACT, single-handedly the CNS has meant that, up until a tragic death earlier this year, there had not been one single death in custody in a police cell in New South Wales. It is because when the police take an Aboriginal or Torres Strait Islander person into custody, they must phone the Aboriginal Legal Service, who runs the CNS program. That gives the person in custody early legal advice from an ALS lawyer, making sure that their fundamental legal rights are respected, and it has led to fewer Aboriginal people being imprisoned. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">But the ALS lawyer will also ask the person being taken into custody, 'Are you okay?' And the answer is often no. There might be threats of self-harm or suicide. There might be concerns about access to medication, immediate medication that's required—that's a common concern—and they can also notify if they have any injuries or any injuries that may have been sustained in the arrest that need to be examined by a medical practitioner. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The CNS is absolute value for money. It costs just over half a million dollars a year to run—almost the same cost as locking up two juveniles. In New South Wales and the ACT, it assists over 15,000 people per year, averaging 300 calls per week. So for qualified legal advice for that welfare support, that wellbeing—court, bail and diversion efficiencies—it's not expensive for any government. As I said, significantly, it has prevented deaths in police cells up until the tragic death of Ms Maher last year. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Last year, I am proud to say, that the WA Labor Party adopted the CNS as part of its platform, indicating that it would, once in government, institute a CNS because WA has, along with the NT, very, very high rates of Aboriginal incarceration and we continue to have significant numbers of absolutely unavoidable deaths in WA. So I was really pleased to read in the paper last week that our Attorney-General, Mr John Quigley, has instructed his department to consult with relevant agencies and the federal government as to the procedural and operational details to implement the CNS in WA. I know that Minister Scullion has been fairly active around the implementation of the CNS, because he sees the value of it as it's happened in New South Wales and the ACT. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">So what we are looking at now in WA is the introduction of this service and, unfortunately, it's come too late. After the tragic and avoidable death of Ms Dhu in custody in Port Hedland, it was one of the recommendations of the coronial inquest into her death that WA introduce a CNS. Unfortunately then, the Liberal government, Mr Barnett's government, was still in power and they ignored that advice from the coroner—in fact, they behaved disgracefully around the whole passing of Ms Dhu, as we know. Even more so, the federal government offered WA some funding to implement a CNS, and guess what? Mr Barnett, when Premier, refused. He thought that the visitor system—or indeed, his deputy at the time, or the person responsible, Mrs Harvey, who's still in the parliament, I might add, along with Mr Barnett—which operates in prisons across the country, is adequate. It is far from adequate. It does not offer legal advice. It happens after the event. It's a completely inadequate response and shows just how little the Barnett government really cared about the high rates of imprisonment of Aboriginal people that that offer was refused. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Certainly there is no doubt about it—there is no doubt in my mind or the minds of her family—that Ms Dhu would be alive today, if we'd had a CNS in place in Western Australia. She begged for help for severe pains in her stomach. If she'd been given access to an ALS lawyer on admission to that prison cell, the ALS could've agitated for that to happen. I am sure that agitation—external to the pleas that Ms Dhu was making—would have been acted upon. We know that she was taken twice to the local hospital where medical officers said there was nothing wrong with her, and we saw a police officer, in that shocking footage that the family wanted released, minutes before her death telling her she was faking it. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">That's a disgraceful episode in our Western Australian history. Unfortunately, it's not unique. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">If we get this CNS, as proposed by the McGowan government, and, indeed, Attorney-General Mr Quigley, that will go some way to rectifying and making prison a safe place if Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people find themselves arrested and taken to prison. Ms Dhu's mother, Della, said after the coronial inquest that she never ever wanted any other family to go through the trauma and the tragedy of her daughter's death. She said:</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Small">We do not want this to happen to anyone else. Our families are heartbroken and the pain has not left us. My daughter should be with us today. Her loss haunts me each day and it will remain but it will give me at least an ounce of peace to see the CNS implemented.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">That was after the coroner recommended that Western Australia establish that.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">In Western Australia, along with the Northern Territory and South Australia, we convict Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islanders at amongst the highest rates in the world. The CNS is a small step. I know that the McGowan government wants to change the record when it comes to Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander incarceration. We know that Indigenous people are imprisoned at something like 17 per cent or 18 per cent higher than non-Indigenous people, and we really do need to change that record. I am not suggesting for a moment that the CNS is the be-all and end-all. It is a tiny little step. Much more needs to be done. We need to be doing much better on early intervention strategies.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">In Western Australia, the McGowan government has inherited the highest rate in Australia of out-of-home care of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander kids. They are 16 times more likely to be taken from their families and placed in foster care, and of significant concern is that babies are being taken at birth. In the Kimberley region, every single child who finds themselves in out-to-of home care is an Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander child, and we know that there is a very strong correlation between out-of-home care and finding yourself in trouble as a juvenile.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I do note the sadness in Port Hedland. I was up there last week and I visited the youth centre, which is a fabulous centre. Those people knew Ms Dhu as a child and they all told me what a wonderful, remarkable care-free child she was. Her life was taken at the age of 21. The CNS would definitely have meant that Ms Dhu lived today.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">
                  <a href="241710" type="MemberSpeech">
                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Senator SMITH</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Western Australia</span>—<span class="HPS-MinisterialTitles">Deputy Government Whip in the Senate</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">13:37</span>):  I would like to begin by reflecting on Senator Macdonald's comments this afternoon. Those people who know Senator Macdonald who are listening on the broadcast will know that he's an enthusiastic, energetic senator for Queensland. But he was only half right when he reflected on how great Far North Queensland is, because the other half of that statement is, of course, how great the far north-west of northern Australia is—that place we know as the Kimberley region.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">During the recess, I had an opportunity to catch up with Elsa Archer and others—Senator Rachel Siewert was there and the new regional development minister, Alannah MacTiernan, was also there—at the Kimberley Regional Forum, where, with local shires, we discussed a variety of issues that are important to continuing jobs growth and continuing economic development opportunities for the very large and remote numbers of Indigenous communities. I had the opportunity to talk about native title reform and how I think native title reform is necessary if we are going to lift and change that terrible scourge that is Indigenous disadvantage by giving Indigenous people better access to how they might utilise their lands for better resource extraction and for better pastoral lease operations.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The Kimberley is a remarkable place. I know that people say that but, when you visit there—and I know that you, Mr Acting Deputy President Sterle, are a regular visitor to the Kimberley region—you can't but be impressed by its natural beauty—that's a given. But what is happening up there in terms of the pursuit of innovative agricultural techniques is really remarkable. I am not so worried about who brings good ideas to the people of the Kimberley, but you have to agree that the water-for-food initiative, which was a Colin Barnett Royalties for Regions Mia Davies initiative, has really transformed key parts of the Kimberley and it is a very, very exciting part of the world.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Can I just also extend my very, very personal thanks to Elsa Archer. People who know her know she is a stalwart of the Derby community and a stalwart of the Kimberley community, and I have been very heartened by the messages of encouragement I have received from Elsa Archer over the last few days, and of course people across the Kimberley.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I would just like to talk this afternoon about a great deed. I am an active member of a variety of community groups across Western Australia, but one of the proudest groups that I am involved in is the Perth Rotary Club. The Perth Rotary Club, with the Salvation Army in Western Australia, under the fantastic leadership of Rebecca Tolstoy has had for the second year what they call the Path of Hope Foundation Annual Gala Ball. It raises hundreds of thousands of dollars to beat domestic violence. It raises that money to support the great work that the Salvation Army does at the women's hostel in Perth's inner northern suburbs. It's not appropriate for me to identify its location, but they do some fantastic work. The Path of Hope Foundation has worked tirelessly since its establishment in 2012 to break the cycle of family and domestic violence. The foundation's ethos is reflected in its name: to create positive pathways for women affected by violence.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The great state of Western Australia is where I call home and I am privileged to call myself a very proud Western Australian, but it shocked me to learn that last year in 2015-16 WA Police received more than 50,000 calls for help from people reporting cases of family or domestic violence. If you break it down, that is approximately 158 calls a day, and it is very alarming when those statistics are shared with us. What do those statistics actually mean, though? They mean one in three women have experienced physical and/or sexual violence perpetrated by someone who is known to them. It means that domestic and family violence is the principle cause of homelessness for women and their children. It means that Indigenous women and girls are 35 times more likely than the wider female population to be hospitalised due to family violence.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The gala ball brought together a diverse crowd. There were almost 600 people there. From the private sector, from governments, from rotary clubs to entertainers and entrepreneurs—it was a fantastic night. We were all there, though, for one cause. Many people had a great night. I was privileged to sit next to the Western Australian governor, Her Excellency the Hon. Kerry Sanderson, who is a great Western Australian and a great ambassador for Western Australia. But, more than that, people were united in their single mission, the pursuit of one cause, and that was to celebrate the women and children who have survived family and domestic violence. Rebecca Tolstoy, the Path of Hope Foundation director spoke powerfully and eloquently about why we were there. She said: 'Tonight is all about one very special group of people—people who have chosen life, chosen a better future for themselves and their children and who are breaking that cycle of violence hour by hour, day by day, week by week. Their courage is to be commended and tonight is their night. Their actions and their bravery is a beacon of hope to others wanting to break the cycle and to choose a life free of violence.'</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The ball was a strong and powerful demonstration that the community was more determined than ever to break that terrible cycle that we know as family and domestic violence. During the course of the evening we all reflected on the need to provide safe and secure environments for women and their children who find themselves affected by domestic violence and family violence.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I am pleased to share that the government announced a $100 million package last year to help prevent violence against women. But we were reminded at the ball that we all have a role to play in raising awareness about this scourge across our community. It is our responsibility to educate and empower the community to take action. It is interesting that as I have become more aware of this issue, I have become alarmed at the depth to which it permeates our community, and how important it is not to have government addressing this problem but to have community partnerships addressing this problem. What is particularly unique about the Path of Hope Foundation is that it is not just a ball once a year—this year's ball was the second year it has been held; it is actually a foundation that works on the ground to support women and their children from domestic violence. It works in refurbishing homes for people, refurbishing the women's hostel and providing education access for young children who are traumatised because they're no longer able to live in their normal or most reliable family environments. It supports these young children when they go to the local primary school. It supports these young children by building a playground in the hostel.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Let me share with you the entirety of Rebecca Tolstoy's speech to the gathering two Saturday nights ago, 29 July. Rebecca said: 'We all know how wonderful it is to live in Western Australia and to be known as a west Australian. As someone who has chosen WA as my home, I love the can-do spirit. I love its warm, generous and friendly people and the willingness of Western Australians to rally behind people when they choose to have a go.'</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">She went on to say: 'Let me begin by welcoming all of you who are enjoying the Path of Hope Gala Ball for a second time and marvelling at how this simple but important gesture is going from strength to strength. One person who captures the spirit of Western Australia is, for a second time, tonight's major sponsor.' I think it is important to recognise the contribution of a very, very committed Western Australian, a name that is well known to us; a successful Western Australian businessperson, but someone who does supports many, many charities throughout the community—that is, of course Mrs Rinehart, who, through Hancock Prospecting and the Roy Hill project, generously provided support for the evening's event.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Rebecca went on to say, 'We are truly blessed by the continuing support of other long-term financial donors to the gala ball: Mr Stan Perron, Mr David Reid, Mr Alan Tribe and Mr Richard Lockwood.' Rebecca said: 'Since our last gala ball, Path of Hope has travelled the world with its gesture of hope and empowerment, and has been greeted with open arms and encouragement. From Perth, Western Australia; to Atlanta, Georgia; to the meeting rooms of the United Nations in New York; to Stockholm, Sweden; and the halls of the United Nations in Geneva, the world has recognised what we in Perth have known for a long time. We have taken the rich heritage of the trusted and complemented it with the innovation of a 21st-century approach.

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">
                  <a href="BK6" type="MemberSpeech">
                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Senator HANSON</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Queensland</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">13:47</span>):  I am well known for speaking up about immigration, but what isn't well known is that I am not anti migrant. In 1996 I spoke out about the high rate of immigration from Asia that would have put us on a trajectory of losing our Australian identity. I support immigration when it is in the best interests of Australia, but we have made a mistake in accepting high levels of migrants from countries where democracy is unknown and accepting people who follow Islam and its political ideology.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">One of the reasons we don't know enough about the extent of the problems with Islamic immigration is that political parties don't want to upset the Muslim vote. There is plenty of information collected, but it is not published and it is not available to senators like me. In hiding the evidence of high unemployment and high dependence on social welfare, the government hopes you won't discover the problems associated with Australian Muslim communities.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Despite the best efforts of Labor and the coalition, we have found some reliable information. The unemployment rate amongst Australian Muslims is more than double the average rate and it is more than 50 per cent higher than the nearest other major religious group. The unemployment rate for Muslim women is higher than that of Muslim men, making Muslim women the most likely religious group to be unemployed in Australia. This persistent high-unemployment level among Australian Muslims translates into high levels of income support in the form of payments made by the Department of Social Services.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I don't have enough time to go into greater detail, but in densely populated Muslim suburbs, Muslims are paid high levels of taxpayer-funded support in the form of disability pensions, carer pensions, carer allowances and other forms of income support. Australian Muslims are a significant drain on the public purse, because of the rates of unemployment and dependence on social welfare. You will not hear these facts from Labor, because Labor is muzzled in pursuit of keeping the Muslim vote it already heavily relies on. We looked at the electoral areas containing 10,000 or more Australian Muslims, using 2016 census information. Every one of those 15 federal seats is held by Labor, and 50.4 per cent of all Australian Muslims live in these 15 Labor seats. It is the concentration of the Muslim vote, in a relatively small number of postcodes and electoral divisions, which gives Australian Muslims a much higher influence in Australian politics. What we know for certain is that Labor needs the Muslim vote to keep those seats in the parliament. The reliance on the Muslim vote in turn gives Australian Muslims an important say over Labor policy, and that influence is increasing because of the high birth rates among Muslim women. In fact, the number of Australian Muslims doubled in the decade between 2006 and 2016.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The young age profile of Muslims in Australia means that Muslims will increase naturally at a greater rate than any other. The concentration of Australian Muslims in a limited number of postcode areas, together with the high rates of birth, means Labor is now firmly in the hands of the Muslim voter. The demographic information is irrefutable. The only issue is how Australian Muslims will change the Australian Labor Party and Australia.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The Muslim vote has pushed hard for Labor to abandon its traditional support for Israel and they have kept Labor silent on the fate of Christians in the Middle East, particularly Maronite and Coptic Christians, who once made up 20 per cent of the Middle East and now make up less than five per cent. In the lower house seat of Blaxland, in NSW, there are 50,995 Muslims, or 29.2 per cent of the population. In the Sydney seat of Watson, there are 40, 903 Muslims or 23.4 per cent of the population. In Victoria it's a similar situation. In Calwell, there are 29,324 Muslims and in Werriwa there are 21, 761 Muslims.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Labor has made a conscious decision to sell its soul for the Muslim vote. Every speech and every comment made by Labor is now made with reference to keeping the Muslim vote. Labor cannot speak out in opposition or act in government on issues affecting Australian Muslims because it fears losing seats in parliament. The numbers are so finely balanced in the lower house of this parliament that the loss of this small clutch of seats would see Labor's chance of government end. Labor's dependence on the Muslim vote is frightening, because a small but fast-growing group, opposed to our way of life, is bending Labor to its will. And communities of Coptic Christians and Lebanese Maronites and other Christians know how that story ends.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The Muslim vote opposes same-sex marriage, because the notion of sexual orientation is against the fundamental teachings of Islam. So here is Labor's dilemma: how does Labor get same-sex marriage passed, bury the hundreds of thousands of 'no' votes and not upset Muslims in Labor electorates? The best way forward is to let parliament decide, and then they will tell their Muslim voters they had to follow the party line—gutless! </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">It is common knowledge that areas with high concentrations of Australian Muslims are also areas associated with organised crime and acts of terrorism performed in the name of Islam. Labor knows this as well as any Australian, but it cannot speak directly, so it talks in riddles. Who can forget Bill Shorten talking to the cameras about combating extreme extremism and hoping those watching could see that he was like any one in a hostage situation. He was communicating in riddles, hoping not to offend the hostage takers—that is, the Muslim vote in Australia. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Australian Muslims take all the benefits that Australia has to offer, but Australian Muslims are underrepresented in the workforce and underrepresented in the Defence forces, instead preferring to fight for ISIL in Syria and Iraq. A federal investigation into the status of foreign fighters found 96 per cent had been on welfare benefits, including disability pensions, before leaving to fight overseas. It's a disgrace that more Australian Muslims have gone to fight in Syria and Iraq than have joined the Australian Defence Forces to defend Australia. It is a disgrace our pension system is abused by Australian Muslims, and it is a disgrace the Department of Social Services is inept. It is undeniable that many Australian Muslims choose to be separate from other Australians living in communities. Many of them never leave these communities except when accessing government services and benefits and having holidays in their countries of birth.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">One Nation supporters have a positive view of migrants when they are willing to become active citizens, to work and to make Australia a better place. However, we are not seeing too much of that from Australian Muslims. It would be comforting to think the problems we have with Muslim refugees and second-generation Muslims will resolve, given time and money, but there is no evidence anywhere in the world that this will be the case.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We need to learn the lesson from other countries who have accepted high numbers of Muslims into their country. They have found that, as the number of Muslims rise in a country, the tolerance of those Muslims to others in that country falls. Then, Muslims demand special treatment, which is given for the sake of appeasement, but is never enough. The demands just keep coming—discussions to change the words 'race' to 'people' in Section 51(xxvi) of the Australian Constitution for the benefit of Muslims because they are not a race, they are a people. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">There are no democratic Islamic countries in the world. If we don't ban further immigration from Islamic countries, our way of life will be lost and the freedoms we take for granted will be gone.</span>

If we are going to have a nation that actually welcomes people from overseas—that actually builds a strong, cohesive nation—then that sort of nonsense that we've just heard from One Nation has to be challenged every time it is raised because there are so many Muslim contributors to our society. There are so many Muslim sports people in our society.

That is a very important question, of course. Reports that North Korea has acquired the ability to develop a miniaturised nuclear device which may be placed on an intercontinental ballistic missile are deeply unsettling. We need to be clear that responsibility for tension and instability arising out of the Korean Peninsula lies at the feet of the regime in Pyongyang, whose actions contravene international law, pose a serious threat to global peace, stability and the rules based order we seek to protect and advance. </span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">North Korea has been in flagrant violation of no fewer than six United Nations Security Council resolutions going back as far as 2006, which condemn its multiple missile launches and five nuclear tests—most recently its ICBM test on 28 July this year. North Korea has a chequered history of making and breaking promises to wind back its illegal nuclear weapons and missile programs. Since taking power in December 2011, Kim Jong-un has accelerated the development of these programs. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">If a North Korean intercontinental ballistic nuclear missile is capable of reaching the United States, then such a weapon is capable of reaching Australia and poses an unacceptable, existential threat to our country. Australia's policy, with respect to confronting this challenge, remains clear and consistent. Presently, North Korea is defiant; however, Pyongyang is deterrable, if the international community is determined and resolute. The collective way forward is to call on all countries to fully implement UNSC sanctions against North Korea. <span style="font-style:italic;">(Time expired)</span></span>

Australia has sanctioned 37 people and 31 entities under our autonomous sanctions measures. As well, of course, we are parties to all of the collective sanctions regimes, which are the subject of the UN Security Council resolutions to which I have referred. In fact, on 30 November, Australia was a co-sponsor of UN Security Council Resolution 2321, which placed additional UN sanctions on North Korea. We strongly support Resolution 2371, passed on 5 August, which places further significant restrictions on trade with North Korea, including on its exports of coal, iron, lead, and seafood. But all nations, particularly those with diplomatic or economic relationships with North Korea, must use their leverage.</span>

So, as I said, we were a co-sponsor of Resolution 2321 last November. We are one of the nations that supported Resolution 2371, supported by almost all members of the United Nations, which was passed four days ago, which is the most comprehensive sanctions package against Pyongyang to date. As I was saying to you a moment ago, all nations, particularly those with diplomatic or economic relationships with North Korea, must use their leverage to place pressure on Pyongyang to change North Korea's calculations, and the Australian government calls upon them to do so. All nations, but most critically the P5, must defend the authority of the United Nations Security Council. We are constantly reviewing and extending our autonomous sanctions regime to complement and augment security council sanctions. </span>

To add to the statements of the Attorney-General: as both the Prime Minister, the foreign minister and I have consistently said, Australia condemns North Korea's ongoing development of nuclear and ballistic missile programs in the strongest possible terms. North Korea has shown that it has no regard for the welfare of its own population, no regard for the security of, and good relations with, its neighbours, and no regard for international law. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">North Korea has claimed nuclear capability. It is repeatedly testing ICBMs. It has issued directed threats against the United States, South Korea, Japan and, indeed, Australia. Reports today of North Korea's threat to strike Guam further underlines the need for the regime to abandon its illegal ballistic missile and nuclear weapons programs. North Korea's actions are, as the Attorney-General said, in blatant breach of UN Security Council resolutions. Its actions undermine regional security and stability, and the international community cannot tolerate this behaviour. North Korea's long-term interests would be best served by ceasing its nuclear and ballistic missiles programs and engaging positively with the international community. Australia will continue to work with the international community in response to North Korea's actions to seek a resolution in a peaceful manner and to ensure the long-term stability of our region.</span>

Senator Bilyk, I must say I entirely disagree with your view that the only recommendation that matters is the one which is currently under consideration. I don't agree with that at all.</span>

These are the issues that matter most to the Australian people, Senator Bilyk—reliability and affordability. In approaching the Finkel report, and in approaching the appropriate policy choices and policy responses to this problem, this government will be guided by pragmatism. We will be guided by engineering; we will be guided by the facts. One thing that we will not be guided by, Senator Bilyk, is ideology. It is because your side of politics was guided by ideology in its approach to energy policy that, during the period of the Labor government, electricity prices rose by 101 per cent over six years. Because your side of politics, Senator Bilyk, was guided by ideology not engineering, in the state of South Australia the Weatherill Labor government cannot even keep the lights on. The Turnbull government is determined to ensure that power in Australia is affordable and that supply is reliable. And that will shape our response.</span>

Far from being policy paralysis, Senator Bilyk, we are very carefully considering the one outstanding recommendation of the Finkel report. In particular, the Prime Minister and the Minister for the Environment and Energy, Mr Frydenberg, are carefully considering that recommendation. In the near future, they will be bringing a recommendation to the government. </span>

As I said in answer to Senator Bilyk's first supplementary question, we are considering very carefully the one outstanding recommendation of the Finkel report that is under consideration, and the relevant minister, Mr Frydenberg, in collaboration with the Prime Minister, will be bringing a recommendation to the government in the near future. But, in the meantime, as is evident from the important meeting happening in this building today, the government is active on other fronts. <span style="font-style:italic;">(Time expired)</span></span>

Minister, in response to last week's stunning revelations that the Commonwealth Bank facilitated money laundering through its deposit machines, the Greens and a number of investor representatives have called for swift and decisive action to sanction bank executives, including canning their bonuses, cutting their salaries or sacking them. Yesterday, the bank's board cut cash bonuses to executives to placate such calls. Even after taking a haircut, the CEO of CommBank, Ian Narev, will still earn close to $10 million a year. Does the government believe that it is fair that the CEO of a bank that has a rap sheet as long as my arm gets paid $10 million a year?</span>

Obviously, the remuneration of employees of businesses across Australia is a matter for the boards of those relevant companies. In Australia, we have a very robust regulatory framework in place when it comes to the financial services sector. We have a very robust prudential regulatory arrangement. We have a very robust compliance arrangement in place. There are a range of law enforcement processes currently underway, and it would not be appropriate for the government to pre-empt the outcomes and the conclusions of those law enforcement processes. I know that Senator Whish-Wilson would like the government to jump to a conclusion and pre-empt the outcome of those processes, but we don't think that's appropriate.</span>

Some investor representatives have been questioning the salaries of executives of the major banks for some time. At last year's Commonwealth Bank AGM these investors made an unprecedented first strike when they voted against the executive remuneration report. Minister, do you accept that, if executive salaries at the CommBank or other banks don't even meet their shareholders' expectations, then they certainly don't meet community expectations?</span>

The owners of the business delegate certain authorities to the board of the business. The board of any business is responsible, among other things, for the remuneration of their employees. In that context, of course, the board is accountable to shareholders, and that is precisely the way these processes are meant to work. It is not up to the government to determine what the appropriate remuneration arrangements are for employees of these companies in the circumstances that you describe.</span>

If you look at all of the credible data, it will show you that the level of inequality has not increased in the ways proposed by some. We believe in equality of opportunity. We believe people in providing people with the incentives to be the best they can be—because that is how they contribute to the overall success of our country—and in creating the best possible opportunity for everyone across Australia to get ahead. </span>

It is an incredibly important question. Of course, the outcome that the government is focused on is: providing the best possible opportunity for Australians today and future generations of Australians to get ahead, to be successful and to have the most successful life they possibly can, because we understand that their individual success will contribute to our success as a nation, will contribute to providing opportunity to all Australians to be the best they possibly can be. That is why our government and our economic plan, our plan for jobs and growth, are based on the principles of freedom—the free market; reward for effort; encouraging people to stretch themselves, to work hard, to take risks. And, yes, our policies are based on the principle that we do need to ensure that we have an appropriately generous social safety net to look after those people in need of support. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Having a national economic plan that provides the best possible opportunity for individual Australians to be as successful as they can be will not only be good for them and their families and the communities they live in; it will be good for our country. It will help us generate the resources we need to ensure we can support those Australians who are doing it tough and we can continue to provide all of the necessary resources into providing a generously funded social safety net to ensure that those Australians that need that support can be appropriately supported. But let me be very, very clear: this is a government that wants to encourage people to be the best they can be. This is a government that wants to encourage people to pursue opportunity. This is a government that wants to incentivise people to make the best possible contribution to our country, to help contribute to our success as a nation and to help contribute to the success of their communities. That is how we create more jobs, that is how we create better-paid jobs and that is going to be a key battleground between now and the next election. </span>

The Leader of the Opposition believes that the politics of envy will work for him, that the politics of envy will help him be politically successful. He believes in pointing to Australians who are successful, who have done well, and telling Australians who are doing it tough: 'We want to tear down those people who have worked hard, who have taken risks and who have done the best they can. We are going to help you have a better life if only we go after those people that are successful.' Well, let me tell you, there was a reason for the historical failure of socialism. If you want to achieve equality of outcome instead of equality of opportunity, the people that are best able to be successful, the people that are best able to contribute to our success as a nation, the people that are best able to contribute to— <span style="font-style:italic;">(Time expired)</span></span>

There are examples all around the world. If you want to make-believe that the way to create more opportunity is by tearing down people who are successful, there will be two things that happen in that circumstance: people who can be successful might leave or they will lose the incentive of stretching themselves and doing the best they can. Neither of them are good outcomes for our country, and this is not something that we believe is the best way forward for Australia. I believe that Australians will not support an agenda that will seek to turn Australia into a socialist economy.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-MemberQuestion" style="font-weight:bold;"> (South Australia)</span> (14:26):  My question is to the Minister for Industry, Innovation and Science. The Australian automotive industry employs 380,000 people across 69,000 mostly small and family-owned businesses. The industry contributes $37 billion, or 2.2 per cent, to Australia's GDP. Yesterday, the Motor Trades Association of Australia released a comprehensive study into the current state and future direction of the industry. The study found that the sector is currently short of 27,300 skilled workers, such as mechanics and spray painters, and that this shortage is expected to grow to 35,000 next financial year. Motor trade industry leaders are critical of the government's lack of leadership in relation to these skills shortages. Will the government consider the industry's repeated requests in returning the automotive skills council and vocational education responsibilities to industry, in order to effectively deal with the skills crisis?</span>

He is right to say that the Australian automotive industry is one of our key sectors. I had the opportunity a few months ago to open the Auto Aftermarket Expo in Melbourne, and that was huge. There were a lot of companies there doing a lot of innovative things. As the VACC and MTAA report states, it now employs nearly 400,000 people and makes a major contribution to GDP and is going through an unprecedented change. For SMEs in the sector, they're dealing with more technologically advanced products, more advanced materials and even higher consumer expectations.</span>

I take the point that the good senator is making about taskforces. I'll look at that, but in the meantime we're getting on with a number of programs to tackle skill shortages. We're working closely with each of the three major auto manufacturers to ensure workers have the best opportunity to transition to new jobs. We'll continue to work with the VACC and MTAA to see what more can be done to ensure skilled workers are finding jobs in our auto industries and SMEs in particular.

Despite a requirement to respond to a Senate committee report within three months, there appears to be no response to this report. It is 17 months overdue.

I mean no discourtesy to the Senate. I will see what's happened. In the meantime—as I've said before—in the budget we announced a $1.5 billion Skilling Australians Fund, prioritised to apprenticeships and traineeships. The fund, when matched with state and territory funding, will support up to 300,000 apprentices, trainees, pre-apprentices and higher-level skilled Australians. These changes will give Australian jobseekers the skills they need to find work.</span>

That builds on the Advanced Manufacturing Growth Fund that we had in the budget, which in turn built on a $155 million growth fund announced earlier to help the auto industry transition.</span>

On this side of the chamber, we absolutely believe that Australians deserve nothing less than workplaces that are cooperative, productive and fair. Fairness begins with people obeying the law. And this means everyone, whether you are an employer, a union or a worker. There should be no tolerance for either rogue employers or rogue unions who break the law. Unfortunately, though—and it has recently been in the press yet again—there is one union which does believe that it is above the law. This is the union that we all know reached a recent milestone of in excess of $10 million in fines being imposed against it for unlawful behaviour.</span>

He threatened inspectors from the Australian Building and Construction Commission that his union would 'follow them into neighbourhoods, follow them to their local footy clubs and shopping centres and intimidate their families'. Sadly, this is not an isolated example. For example, WA CFMEU official Luke Collier has been imprisoned for three counts of assault and entering a premises with the intent to commit an indictable offence. He also had admitted to violent crimes against his former girlfriend. And last year, he was fined for breaching industrial laws for his part in organising a strike at Barangaroo during which he threatened a female police officer. Where, you may ask, is Mr Collier now? Guess what? He is currently the youth organiser for the WA branch of the CFMEU. What type of example is Mr Collier going to set?</span>

We on this side of the chamber are very, very proud to say we support a strong and vibrant building and construction industry where small and medium employers can compete without fear of being bullied or intimidated. And why? Because a fair and vital construction industry means more jobs for Australians. And that's what we are all about.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">South Australia</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">14:37</span>):  My question is to the Minister for Regional Development, Senator Nash. I had a surreal experience last week, Minister, standing with uncommon allies supporting an independent inquiry into allegations of water theft aired recently on the ABC <span style="font-style:italic;">Four Corners</span> program. I noticed that you, Minister, were photographed in the <span style="font-style:italic;">Goulburn Post</span> in 2012 with your allies, former state water minister, Ms Hodgkinson, and current primary industries minister, Mr Blair. Both are key players in the Barwon-Darling affair, and you were photographed at a National Party event. <span style="font-style:italic;">The </span><span style="font-style:italic;">Daily Telegraph</span> claims Mr Blair long knew about the illegal water-pumping allegations against the same Mr Peter Harris accused of water theft on <span style="font-style:italic;">Four Corners</span>. Then Mr Blair, last week, lobbied state cabinet and gave himself powers to retrospectively approve water allocated to Mr Harris. Is this the same Peter Harris who donated $5,000 on two occasions in 2011 to the National Party? And if so, does this not strengthen the case for a truly independent inquiry?</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">New South Wales</span>—<span class="HPS-MinisterialTitles">Deputy Leader of The Nationals, Minister for Regional Development, Minister for Local Government and Territories and Minister for Regional Communications</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">14:38</span>):  Firstly, in answer to the senator's question relating to Peter Harris, I would certainly want to check that and not assume that is the same Peter Harris, but I am certainly very happy to do so for the senator. Secondly, it is entirely unsurprising that I was photographed in 2012 with National Party ministers. At the outset, I certainly reject any assertion of impropriety by National Party ministers. I would also note around these issues of water that, as recently as June this year, all basin states—including South Australia—agreed to the implementation of the Murray-Darling Basin Plan. Now, I am aware—as I suspect everybody is around this chamber—of the allegations that were raised in the <span style="font-style:italic;">Four Corners</span> program.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Firstly, noncompliance will not be tolerated. Nobody condones theft. People who act illegally should face the full force of the law. I also point out that these are, indeed, allegations. While I note Senator Bernardi's interest in this issue, I don't think we should be driven in our response by reports in <span style="font-style:italic;">The Daily Telegraph</span>. Therefore, the New South Wales government and the Commonwealth have taken very measured and considered steps to respond to these allegations. Firstly, the Commonwealth has instigated a Murray-Darling Basin Authority review of compliance regimes, which we very recently put in place in response to these allegations. I also note that the New South Wales government has instigated an inquiry, headed up by Ken Matthews AO, whom I think everybody in the chamber would respect, not only for his public service but also in his role, under the then Labor government, heading up the National Water Commission. As well, there are three members on that committee who have ICAC experience, indicating the depth of response to this issue.</span>

One of the two big cotton farmers accused in the program employs an MDBA regional engagement officer. Does the minister accept these matters diminish confidence that the MDBA can get to the bottom of the water theft allegations?</span>

I'm not here to provide a commentary on the content of that story. I'm here to provide information. In relation to Perin Davey, she is a very well-known player in the water industry. She has had extensive experience in water policy issues over a number of years. It is unsurprising that she was put forward to be part of that group. Indeed, I note that the Queensland Labor government supported that going forward. However, I do note that, in the interests of the Murray-Darling Basin and in the interests of the health of the river, Perin Davey has withdrawn that nomination and asked not to be considered. I think she should be commended for putting the Murray-Darling ahead of any of her own interests.</span>

I don't think anybody in this chamber would be of the view that the ICAC has the powers absolutely to look into this issue and to determine appropriately the response, with the power to compel the production of documents or other information, the power to compel a public authority or a public official to provide information, the power to enter properties, the power to obtain search warrants and the power to use surveillance devices. The response has been thorough and appropriate.</span>

Given that $122 million could fully fund the tuition of 4,560 nursing students, can the minister please explain to the Senate why saving the Prime Minister's job is more important than caring for sick Australians?</span>

If ever that was even more obvious than it had been, it would be obvious to you from Senator Pratt's question, which was only about politics.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">The government took to the 2016 election a clear, unambiguous promise that the issue of marriage equality would be resolved by the Australian people at a plebiscite. We made that commitment to the people and we were re-elected. We intend to keep that promise. So, last year, the government introduced into the Senate a bill for a plebiscite, which was defeated by the Labor Party and the Greens playing political games with gay people's lives. This morning the government sought to revive debate on that bill and we were defeated by the Labor Party and the Greens because they want to play political games with gay people's lives.</span>

What I would say to everyone on the Australian electoral roll—all 16 million of them—is: have your say; involve yourself in this important act of democratic choice.</span>

I actually don't hear people in the street saying that they are worried and that they lie awake at night worrying about whether Australia should become a republic, and yet Mr Shorten has decided that Australia should have a plebiscite about whether we become a republic—not a constitutional referendum, for which there is explicit provision under section 128 of the Constitution, but a plebiscite on an issue that is on nobody's mind, except a few ideologues around Mr Bill Shorten. So don't come in here condemning a plebiscite, Senator Pratt, when your own leader just announced one.</span>

But, Senator Pratt, evidently, unlike you, I do regard the question of marriage equality as an important question. Not only do I regard it as an important question; I actually regard it as a deeply important social and cultural issue which is best resolved by making as many Australians as possible stakeholders in the outcome and making as many Australians as possible feel that they have had their say in the outcome. And I'm very sorry, Senator Pratt, that you were one of those on your side of this chamber who, rather than progress this issue, decided to play politics with gay people's lives.</span>

Unfortunately, the culture of violence and intimidation in some registered organisations also extends to silencing those who actually call out bad behaviour. This has, unfortunately, been demonstrated on numerous occasions. </span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">A few years ago, in 2014, prior to our legislation being implemented, three officials of the CFMEU in New South Wales stood up and had the guts to call out illegal and corrupt behaviour. They actually put their faces on the ABC's <span style="font-style:italic;">7.30</span> program on 16 October 2014. This is what they said:</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Small">There have been reports of corruption, association with murderers, association with gangsters, association with terrorists, money being paid to union officials, union officials intimidating other union officials, union officials being forced out of their jobs …</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">What do you think happened to those men? The head of the CFMEU at the time, Dave Noonan, summoned the officials to an internal star chamber and sacked them. He said he sacked them because what they had done in blowing the whistle on corruption was 'gross misbehaviour'. It gets worse, though. When the concerns were raised with Michael O'Connor, the national head of the CFMEU, what did he do to stand by the workers and protect them? He did absolutely nothing. That is why we brought in the whistleblower protections.</span>

The fact that we had instances of whistleblower victimisation, with an organisation sidelining and then sacking officials who had the guts to stand up and blow the whistle and put their faces on national television, shows us all why these whistleblower protections are so necessary. Our legislation, passed with the support of the crossbench, now prohibits victimisation of the kind that we saw at the CFMEU. It also prohibits those responsible for turning a blind eye from doing this. We are committed to standing up for those who have the guts to stand up themselves and call out corruption. <span style="font-style:italic;">(Time expired)</span></span>

To assist in recovery from Cyclone Debbie, the Queensland government with the support of local mayors requested the Turnbull government match its contribution of $110 million in natural disaster relief and recovery arrangements category D funding. In response the Turnbull government has committed a dismal $29 million, despite the Queensland government and local councils having provided all information requested at that time. How can the minister justify the government short-changing the people of regional Queensland in this manner as they recover from the devastation of Cyclone Debbie?</span>

The Australian government has provided significant support to Queenslanders affected by Cyclone Debbie. Let me tell you what it has been. Before Cyclone Debbie even crossed the coast we had ADF personnel and Centrelink staff on the ground to provide assistance. We have also provided significant financial assistance. We have committed to reimbursing up to 75 per cent of the damage bill under the NDRRA, an estimated Commonwealth liability of $683 million, and more than $16.8 million to date via the disaster recovery payment and disaster recovery allowance. On top of this, we have agreed to cost share a category D support package of $58.6 million, including a $40 million betterment fund; a $15 million environment package to assist the clean-up of beaches, recreational parks, rivers and waterways; a $2.1 million economic package, which includes employing industry recovery officers to provide financial counselling to primary producers; and $1.5 million to restore and repair the Airlie Beach foreshore in Whitsunday regional council and the Bluewater Trail in the Mackay regional council.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">The remainder of the funding requested by the state of Queensland was either unsupported by evidence or outside the scope of the NDRRA, as the Queensland government knew. In the case of the Shute Harbour marina, the Queensland government provided evidence of $8.8 million of damage but also that this asset is covered by insurance. <span style="font-style:italic;">(Time expired)</span></span>

Let me give you another example of a claim by the Queensland government which was not based on any evidence. In the case of the Whitsunday Coast airport there was a claim for $40 million. No evidence of any damage was provided by the Queensland government in its application. In fact, in June of this year the Queensland government announced $40 million in infrastructure funding for this project—not for disaster recovery but for new infrastructure. So I think we can see what's going on there, Senator Chisholm.</span>

Let me give you a couple more examples of claims made by the Queensland government which were not supported by any evidence whatsoever. Let us take the case of the Bluewater Trail and Queens Park redevelopment, a claim of $10 million. The Commonwealth agreed to fund the recovery where evidence was provided, and did so. The only shortfall of the $10 million claim was in respect of that part of the claim for which the Queensland government provided no evidence of damage, and the same applies to the Airlie Beach foreshore revitalisation. <span style="font-style:italic;">(Time expired)</span></span>

                    <span class="HPS-MemberContinuation">Senator PRATT:</span>
                  </a>  This Monday, the Liberal party room came to a decision that broke the hearts of hundreds and thousands of LGBTI Australians. Those in the coalition have decided to denigrate the LGBTIQ community by attempting to pass the plebiscite through this place yet again, and I thank my Labor colleagues and those on the crossbenches for again voting this ridiculous plebiscite plan down. Yet, in another slap to the face of our community and, indeed, all Australians, this government has decided that it's appropriate to spend some $122 million on a divisive, hateful and, frankly, illegitimate postal survey. This illegitimate postal survey is simply a result of the compromising position that this weak Prime Minister, Mr Malcolm Turnbull, finds himself in. What we have here is a situation where the government has needed to satisfy the extreme right wing of the coalition in a search for stability. Prime Minister Turnbull has decided to spend this ridiculous amount of taxpayer money on an illegitimate postal survey that members of his own government have not even gone to the extent of honouring the outcome of, in terms of how they will then vote in this place.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">As my question highlighted, there are a great many things that $122 million of taxpayer money could be better spent on, and I'm particularly moved by the Facebook post of one Jackie Hodson, who has cystic fibrosis. When the previous version of the plebiscite was being considered, she posted the following on her Facebook page: 'It's going to cost roughly $160 million for the government to run the plebiscite to confirm what we already know—that the Australian society supports same-sex marriage. Here I am, 25 years old and fighting to breathe. I have battled cystic fibrosis since infancy, and now I'm facing a big, fat fight to stay alive on revolutionary medicine that is saving my life.' She says she's been lucky to be on the medicine Orkambi through a compassionate scheme. However, there are thousands of other children and young adults who need this drug now, and some will die while they wait. She goes on to say: 'I can't understand how we can justify letting innocent people die unnecessarily. How can we justify breaking the hearts of all our mums and dads, brothers, sisters, partners? How can the comparable cost of this plebiscite, a vote, be justified while denying me a lifeline—my only chance to marry the love of my life, have a family of my own and grow old? Both injustices need to end, and they need to end now. Love is love, and please let me breathe easy.' And she has asked people to share her Facebook post.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">So there are a great many other priorities that this government could spend that money on. I would love to see that $122 million given to the PBS so that they can weigh up the decision of funding medicines like Orkambi or other important life-saving drugs. It is a ridiculous waste of priorities on the part of this nation to save the Prime Minister's skin, to gloss over their internal division—to spend this money on a wasteful postal plebiscite. That $122 million could go to a great many other worthwhile causes in our nation.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">As Senator Brandis highlighted in his answer to my question, why has Mr Bill Shorten put up a plebiscite on the republican question? The simple fact is: to change that problem requires a change in our constitution, whereas marriage equality can be determined by this place and the other place by a simple vote. And you will not even bind your members to uphold its findings. <span style="font-style:italic;">(Time expired)</span></span>

I quite like Senator Pratt but I cannot believe she is running this argument today. A plebiscite done by the government is bad for her friend who needs medicines, but two plebiscites run by the Labor Party are, apparently, okay. Senator Pratt, you certainly can't really seriously believe that argument. If you are right—and I don't think you are—on the argument about the cost, then it's doubly wrong for Mr Shorten to promise that twice. I can't believe that you have the gall, the front, the hard skin to get up in this chamber and make such a contradictory argument. As I say, I quite like you but I just can't believe you are putting this position.</span>

                  </a>  Yes, of course. Thank you very appropriately, Madam Deputy President. I am just indicating my concern for Senator Pratt, being forced to run what is quite clearly a ridiculous and so contradictory argument. Senator Pratt selectively quotes one email. I could quote 10,000 on each side of the argument. But I do want to, particularly at this time, acknowledge the University of Queensland LNC, who did a survey of young people clearly showing that young people wanted the people of Australia to decide this issue. So I thank them for that. Senator Pratt justifies Mr Shorten having a plebiscite on something that requires not a plebiscite but a referendum to change the constitution. Again, Senator Pratt, through you, Madam Deputy President, Senator Pratt should be aware of that.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">This is an issue which has been debated to death. I simply say again—and repeating the leader's comment to Senator Pratt, through you, Madam Deputy President: if Senator Pratt had voted for this plebiscite last year, the whole issue would have been over and done with by now. It would have been resolved six months ago.</span>

                  </a>  On 11 February we would have had a resolution. Yet, it's Senator Pratt and her team, the Greens and Senator Xenophon—who should not be excused from this stupidity—who are determined to carry on this debate for political reasons, as Senator Brandis has mentioned. There is no policy purity at all in the Labor Party's position, or in the position of the Greens or Senator Xenophon, not that we ever expect any sort of decent policy from any of those people.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Senator Pratt, why do you object to the Australian people having a vote on this? Your leader wants the Australian people to have a vote on two particular issues, neither of which too many people are talking about. Here is something that so many Australians had so many different views about. It was an appropriate question to put to the people of Australia. Why don't you trust the people of Australia? Why didn't you allow this to go to a vote six months ago—and then we wouldn't be talking about this today. People who you say are concerned by the indecision wouldn't have been indecisive had you and your team—I say that through you, Madam Deputy President—agreed to have a plebiscite. It would have been resolved six months ago and we'd be moving onto the issues which are of real importance to the people of Australia—things like jobs; things like health, as you mention; things like education; and things like the economy generally—rather than wasting so much time on this, and now having to go through a postal plebiscite to get the views of the people of Australia.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">It would have been much better to have a compulsory plebiscite. You people and your allies have chosen not to do that, so we will go to the postal plebiscite and we'll still get from that the views of the majority of Australian people, and I can't understand why that frightens you. I indicate, and I've indicated publicly before, that I will be voting no in the plebiscite, but if the majority of Australians say yes I will be voting yes when the bill comes before the parliament. I can't understand, Senator Pratt. Again, I feel for you that you are running such a contradictory argument. </span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Queensland</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">15:11</span>):  Unfortunately over the course of this week we've seen yet another shambles from the Turnbull government, a government that is becoming very well known for the shambles that it creates every time it turns its hand to any form of policy. We're seeing it on energy policy, we're seeing it on housing affordability policy, we're seeing it on education—whether it be higher education or schools—policy and we're seeing it on employment policy. Everything it touches becomes a shambles. There is no difference with the marriage equality debate, where it's happening again, but, sadly, this is a debate in which the shambles the government is creating is going to see a lot of innocent people get very badly hurt.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Now, we know from opinion poll after opinion poll that the vast majority of Australians—I think it's in the order of 70 per cent—support marriage equality and just want to see it get done. We all know how polarised the political debate in our country has become about so many different issues over recent years, where we can't reach agreement and where the community is divided. This is an issue where the community has spoken loudly and clearly on over and over again. There are few issues you could find where you would get such a vast majority of community support as you could find with marriage equality. But rather than just get on with it, act and vote for it, as we do on every other issue—barring constitutional change—in this chamber, the government has chosen to use this as yet another opportunity to settle old scores, to turn on each other and knife each other, and to create yet another policy shambles.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The so-called solution that has come out of the coalition party room this week, headed by Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull, is an absolute joke. Step 1 was to send back to the Senate the request to have an in-person, voting plebiscite, knowing full well that the Senate would vote it down—and that is what we did again today. The government knew that that was an absolutely futile exercise, that nothing had changed and the Senate was still going to vote against a plebiscite where people would turn up and vote. But that was step 1—send it back in there with this forlorn hope that something might have changed. Inevitably, this morning it was voted down by the Senate. So, step 1: a complete failure. </span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Let's move onto step 2: a $120 million postal survey conducted by the census-fail organisation, the Australian Bureau of Statistics. That is a postal survey which will not only be incredibly expensive; it will be optional, it will be divisive, it will be ignored by many members of the coalition party room, when we end up getting to a vote anyway, it will be non-binding—so you've really got to wonder what is the point in having it happen—and we all know from a range of legal opinions that there is actually a real legal cloud over whether this postal survey is even legally permissible to conduct. We will have to wait to see what the High Court says. What an absolute shambles. Step 1, send it to the Senate where it will be inevitably knocked over; and, step 2, send it off to a postal survey which is riddled with holes and which many coalition MPs have said they will ignore the result of no matter what the result is. What an absolute shambles.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Focusing for a moment on the cost of this postal survey: $120 million. In the electorates that I represent, I can think of a large number of things where that money would be better spent. In Rockhampton, in Central Queensland, many people in the community want to see a flood levee built to prevent the town from flooding into the future. This postal survey would pay for three flood levees in the city of Rockhampton. But, instead of doing that, this government is happy to spend money on a postal survey which its own members of parliament will actually ignore. On the Gold Coast, the $120 million amounts to three times the cuts that Minister Steven Ciobo, the federal Minister for Trade, Tourism and Investment, has made to tourism spending. I can think of a lot of tourism businesses on the Gold Coast that could really benefit from some of that tourism funding being restored. But, instead of that, we're going to waste this money on a postal survey which the members of parliament will actually end up ignoring. </span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">In the short time that we’ve had available, I put out a request to Queenslanders to let me know their stories about what this postal survey will mean to them, and I have had quite a number of requests overnight from people. I will just read a couple of them in the time I have remaining. Angela, who has been with her partner, a female partner, for 20 years, said:</span>

                  <a href="250216" type="MemberSpeech">
                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Senator REYNOLDS</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Western Australia</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">15:16</span>):  I, too, rise to take note of the Attorney-General's answer to Senator Pratt's question. We've just heard from the last two speakers on the other side a lot about values, compassion and legal equality. There are other values here that I think are very important. They talk about all those values as if they are the only people in this chamber who have those values. I support same-sex marriage and, if the plebiscite comes back, yes, I will certainly be voting for it. However, like my colleagues on this side of the chamber, a value that we honour and respect greatly is that of keeping our promises. We went to the last election with an absolute commitment that we would put this issue to the Australian people so that they could have their say. It was a very clearly commitment—and one that we have reaffirmed again this week that we will work to honour. I respect that. I participated in the seven hours of debate and discussion two years ago, and I understood the reason that our party room took that decision and it is a reason I still support. It is a way of having this issue resolved once and for all.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I listened to the hypocrisy on a whole range of issues wafting over this chamber to this side from those opposite, and I would like to address each of those issues. First of all, I will address their sudden concern about having plebiscites. This sudden concern comes in the same week that their Leader of the Opposition has proposed at least two plebiscites on issues that they would like to address, including one that we have already in recent times had a referendum on. I cannot recall the last time that those on the other side of the chamber showed any concern about fiscal restraint—putting this nation on a trajectory of hundreds of billions of dollars worth of debt—and yet they fall to the depths in here in this debate today and say that this will cause people's deaths. It's tacky, it's sad and I think it sells all Australians short.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">But the thing that upsets me most about what those opposite have been promoting—in what is really just playing politics with this issue—is their distrust of the Australian people. Our founding fathers, our own founders, didn't enshrine a bill of rights in our Constitution, because they had faith in the people in this chamber that we would move with the times and we would represent, in a representative government, the contemporary will of the Australian people. But, to do that, plebiscites are conducted when we want to actually make sure that we've got the will of the people right. There is absolutely nothing wrong with and there is nothing to fear from Australians having their say.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Everywhere I go and I meet younger Australians, they tell me: 'We want to be heard. We want to have our say.' This is something that is important, particularly to under 30s. They want to have their say on this issue. I would have thought those in this chamber would have embraced the opportunity for younger Australians to have their say on this issue, to influence government policy, to talk to their family members, to talk to their parents and to find a voice electorally. That is not something to be afraid of. Those opposite have so little confidence that the Australian people can engage in a robust but respectful debate on an issue on which there is great diversity of opinion in the Australian community. I have to say, 'Shame on you,' to those opposite for not having confidence in the Australian people that we can any more discuss issues of great importance to our country. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Our founders would be very disappointed in the fact that so many people in this chamber and in the other place do not have the confidence to go out, listen to what Australians have to say and then enact it. I remind all of us in this chamber that the only reason we are still discussing this here today—and not issues like electricity prices, jobs and all those other issues—is that the opposition played politics with it. At the last election, you did not have a position on this publicly. We did. We are delivering our commitment to the Australian people, and I am extremely proud of that. When you think about the implications of what you are doing—what you have done and what you did here again today—by denying Australians the opportunity to have their say in a proper plebiscite, in a full plebiscite, I think you should hang your heads in shame. You have done a great disservice to all Australians. </span>

                  </a>  And let me tell you, Senator, you will need to hear this—we have 43 town camps, 72 remote Indigenous communities and 500 homelands. What consideration have you given to the over 100 Aboriginal languages and the translations that should take place? Earlier this year we heard the sister girls on the Tiwi Islands speak very passionately about the fact that it has been enormously difficult for them to be able to talk about the issues and to stand strong as members of the lesbian and gay community across Australia. In the previous debate in this Senate, in November, we discussed and debated the mental health issues and expressed directly concerns about the effect that any plebiscite, postal or otherwise, would have on the health and wellbeing of those in the LGBTI community. I can speak about the people of the Northern Territory and what they have said to me consistently, over the last 12 months in particular, as we have discussed this. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Minister, you did not give a response at all about the cost of this. You played politics with this. One hundred and twenty-two million dollars is a considerable amount of money. This is where we look at, in terms of first nations peoples, the cuts to Aboriginal health and, in the LGBTIQ area specifically, the cuts of $800,000. The question that is coming forward is: where is your concern really, in all of this? We know for a fact, don't we, that this isn't about whether the Australian people should have a right to speak? This is about the Turnbull government's inability to lead this country in a comprehensive and confident way that lets the families of Australia know that this parliament cares—because you don't care. You do not care. You simply do not care. You have taken this parliament, and this country, down a path that is illogical and irresponsible, and basically you've wimped out on your role as government leaders of this country. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">An online poll of more than 2,000 people, just in the Northern Territory, showed that 72 per cent—almost three in four respondents—supported change to the Marriage Act. That was the front page of the <span style="font-style:italic;">Northern Territory News</span> today. We in the Northern Territory know for a fact that this parliament can vote today. This parliament should vote today. We have heard time and time again of the unnecessary impact that this will have on families in this country as a result of the cowardice of the Turnbull cabinet and the Turnbull government. It should allow this vote on the floor of both the Senate and the House of Reps. Putting families through extraordinarily torturous trauma, which you have heard of personally from members in this house, where you are wilfully deaf and wilfully blind for your own purposes is not a justification that brings the right way in leading this country. It is a justification only for your personal goals—to hold onto what little team you have in your very divisive cabinet.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The questions that are coming through from families across Australia—and certainly, to my email, from the Northern Territory—are: will Australians living overseas be able to vote; what will the government do to ensure people are on the electoral roll; what are you putting in place to ensure the ABS doesn't repeat the mistakes of the census operation; how will you ensure Aboriginal people living remotely and in town camps will have a vote in this, the 50th year since the referendum of 1967? <span style="font-style:italic;">(Time expired)</span></span>

It's really interesting that, at this time when we're having a national debate about inequality, it's certainly been a key topic in recent weeks and no doubt will form the basis of the Labor Party's policies and strategic thrust going into the next federal election. While we're having this national debate on inequality, where's the debate on income inequality? Where's the debate on the massive bonuses and executive salaries that we're seeing in industries like the banking sector? Now, I noted today that this has been back on the agenda in recent days, following the revelation, as quoted in the media, of allegations against Commonwealth Bank in relation to the AUSTRAC filing in the Federal Court against Commonwealth Bank directly in relation to a number of breaches around the use of automatic teller machines and money laundering.</span>

It's not very long—it's only six pages long—and it's actually quite stark and quite illuminating when you read the details of the filing. It outlines a number of money-laundering syndicates. The key point is the alleged harm that the Australian regulator, the government agency, has outlined because of Commonwealth Bank's breaches:</span>

                <span class="HPS-Small">As a result of the failure to file TTRs and SMRs on time or at all, in accordance with the Act, AUSTRAC and other law enforcement and designated agencies have been deprived of information which the Act is intended to provide. Non-reporting and late reporting both delays and hinders law enforcement efforts. Delays in this case have resulted in lost intelligence and evidence (including CCTV footage), further money laundering and lost proceeds of crime.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">And this is the most important line:</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Small">The effect of CommBank's conduct in this matter has exposed the Australian community to serious and ongoing financial crime.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">It might be a coincidence that this was filed and hit the media only a few days before CommBank announced their annual results. The situation this week resulted in an immediate public outcry, not just from the Greens but from a number of CommBank's investors, that the board of CommBank and the chair of CommBank have to take immediate action. We've seen calls for bonuses to be waived, salaries to be cut and executives to be dismissed. It didn't take very long for the board of CommBank to respond yesterday. They cut short-term cash bonuses to their CEO and directors and cut directors' fees. That still leaves us in the situation where the CEO, the head of CommBank, based on last year's package—when you look at long-term bonus incentives and salary—is still paid over $10 million.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">While we're having a discussion about a plebiscite, wouldn't it be fascinating if we actually asked the Australian people what they think and what community expectations are around the salaries of these executives in our banking sector. It's not just our banking sector. There are CEOs across a number of industries who are paid extraordinary amounts of money—in some cases, over $30 million a year. It's not just the private sector; it's also in the Public Service, government organisations and government owned business enterprises, GBEs. Some of the salaries are huge multiples of average weekly earnings or average wages in businesses. If we want to have a serious debate on inequality in Australia or anywhere around the world, we need to debate income inequality. We have stagnate wage growth and we know we have inequality in the housing market in this country, but we need to look at income inequality, we need to have a public debate about how much our CEOs are paid and we need to have it here, in parliament.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">I move the motion on the basis of being the leader of Pauline Hanson's One Nation. Senator Malcolm Roberts' eligibility to stand in the parliament has come under question under section 44(i) of the Australian Constitution. I believe that, in the interests of the public, this must go before the Court of Disputed Returns. But I want to put on record that I believe that Senator Roberts has complied with section 44(i) of the Australian Constitution and I believe that he does have a right to stand in this parliament. I have always stood up for accountability, honesty and integrity and that was shown by Senator Roberts prior to his nomination for the position. It's been taken completely out of context by some media. In all fairness to the people, this needs to be looked at by the court system.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I want to bring to your attention that in 1998, after Senator Heather Hill won her seat under One Nation, she was disqualified in the High Court from taking her position in the Senate. It was then taken up by Senator Len Harris. Senator Len Harris moved in the parliament, on behalf of One Nation, that all senators in this chamber must produce evidence of their citizenship. Both the major and the minor political parties closed ranks and it never became the case. So, since 1998 we have called for accountability with regard to dual citizenship. For every member of this House to comply with the Constitution, they must have allegiance to only one country, and that is Australia. Therefore, as I said, we are seeking for this to go to the High Court for clarification, and my full support is behind Senator Malcolm Roberts, as is the support of Senator Brian Burston and Senator Peter Georgiou. </span>

Let me make it clear that the government will be supporting this motion because the decision to move it has been made by Pauline Hanson's One Nation Party on behalf of one of their own senators. But I do point out to colleagues that we need to be very careful here about the circumstances in which section 44 of the Constitution is invoked by this chamber.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Yesterday, I moved that Senator Canavan be referred to the Court of Disputed Returns, because Senator Canavan was of the view, which the Prime Minister and I shared, that the matter ought to go to the Court of Disputed Returns, in view of the history of matters concerning him, which I won't repeat now. The government supported Senator Di Natale referring Scott Ludlam and Larissa Waters to the Court of Disputed Returns, in light of the fact that they themselves had acknowledged that they considered themselves to be in breach of subparagraph 1 of section 44 of the Constitution and had indeed resigned their place in the chamber or at least purported to resign their place in the chamber. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I understand that Senator Roberts, with whom I spoke this morning, maintains that he considers that he is not in breach of subparagraph 1 of section 44 of the Constitution, as does Senator Canavan. He is entitled to maintain that position, to put his position to the Court of Disputed Returns, and obviously he will respect the outcome. Let me emphasise the point—it was a point actually made by Senator Wong in her contribution yesterday—that there is an issue of the onus of proof in proceedings of this kind. When a person is declared elected to either house of this parliament, after lodging an apparently regular nomination and being declared to have been regularly elected by the Commonwealth electoral officer for their state, then they are a senator or a member. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">They are a senator until either they resign or are declared to have been disqualified under section 44. Where doubts arise about whether or not a member of this chamber or of the other place is in breach of section 44, then, while each case turns on its own particular facts, those who assert against a senator that they were not capable of being chosen because of a prohibition or ground of disqualification under section 44 must demonstrate why it is they claim that the senator or member of the House of Representatives is disqualified. Now, I have seen nothing, literally nothing, other than unverified and undocumented allegations in relation to Senator Roberts.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I caution the Senate that it is a very dangerous course for this chamber or any parliamentary chamber to decide on what might be a party-line vote in the absence of clear evidence that a member of this chamber is not eligible to be here. In fact, that is why we have the provision of the Commonwealth Electoral Act, which enables the chamber to refer the matter to the Court of Disputed Returns. Of course, it's not this chamber that makes that ultimate determination; it is the High Court of Australia sitting as the Court of Disputed Returns. But even such a reference, although not ultimately dispositive of the issue, is something that should never be made lightly and should never be done on a party-line vote.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">In view of what has been said against him and the doubts that have been raised about his eligibility, Senator Roberts has taken counsel, as has his leader, and has decided upon this course of action. In view of that, the government will support, as I said before, the motion that Senator Hanson has moved. I know that Senator Roberts asserts that he is not disqualified by section 44. Until somebody demonstrates to the contrary, that is the way in which he deserves to be treated.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">This has been a parliament in which we have now had six references by the chamber from among its 76 members. One might be forgiven for thinking that being a senator is one of the most hazardous occupations in Australia at the moment, with six people declared elected at the 2016 election either resigning or being referred to the Court of Disputed Returns. I respect the fact—and I think we all ought to respect the fact—that Senator Roberts has submitted himself to this process. No doubt the Court of Disputed Returns will understand the importance of dealing with this, as well as the other references, expeditiously, given that they relate to an issue of vital national importance, namely the proper composition of a house of the parliament.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">In concluding these brief remarks, let me say once again: we should be slow to regard this as a precedent. We should never accept, as either a precedent or an appropriate constitutional practice, that, absent clear evidence, an apparently regularly elected member of this chamber or of the other place should ever be referred by the chamber under the provisions of the Commonwealth Electoral Act on a party-line vote.</span>

I would indicate that the opposition does support the referral by Senator Hanson and congratulate her and her party on making this decision, which I'm sure could not have been an easy decision.

It needs to be resolved in Senator Roberts' interests, One Nation's interests but, more importantly, the Senate, and we need an authoritative and conclusive resolution to this issue.

                  <span class="HPS-OfficeInterjecting">The PRESIDENT:</span>  There is no point of order; that's a debating point. Senator Di Natale, you have the call.</span>

                    <span class="HPS-MemberContinuation">Senator DI NATALE:</span>
                  </a>  Let's be absolutely clear about what's happened here. There are serious questions about Senator Roberts' eligibility to be a representative in this parliament—and serious question marks. His story has changed more times than I have changed underpants. This is somebody who has made commentary publicly about his status as a dual citizen that bears no relationship to the facts. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Senator Roberts has steadfastly refused to engage in what should have been the appropriate conduct in the first instance, and that was an adjudication within the High Court. Indeed, what we saw from One Nation was a refusal to do the decent thing, the honourable thing, the right thing, into coming to this chamber without pressure, from the Greens and, indeed, the crossbench, and to refer this issue to the High Court yesterday when it should have been done with the other references that were made. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The only reason we have had this contribution now from One Nation is because, in about one hour, we were due to come into this chamber with a motion from the Australian Greens, supported by the crossbench and the Labor Party, which would have resulted in exactly the same outcome. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I want you to contrast that with the actions of Senator Waters and Senator Ludlam, who when confronted with a similar issue did the right thing, did the honourable thing, did the decent thing. They stood up, copped it on the chin, resigned and had their case referred to the High Court so that they could ensure that people sitting in this chamber were eligible to sit in this chamber. It has fallen on the Australian Greens to inject some transparency and some accountability into one of the most fundamental questions facing all of us as members of parliament, and that is whether we are eligible to represent the Australian community in this chamber. This is not some rule that sits there gathering dust in the dark recesses of some act. This is our federal Constitution. Now we do not like the rule, but it is the Constitution that lays out very clearly the eligibility of senators to sit in this place and represent the Australian community. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Senator Brandis says that, indeed, it's a dangerous precedent and that the test should be whether someone believes they've done the right thing. No, Senator Brandis, the test isn't whether someone chooses to believe whether they are a citizen; the test is whether they have done the right thing.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">

                    <span class="HPS-MemberInterjecting">Senator Brandis:</span>
                  </a>  Point of order, Mr President. As the <span style="font-style:italic;">Hansard</span> will reveal, I did not say that. I did not say that that is the test.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">
                  <span class="HPS-OfficeInterjecting">The PRESIDENT:</span>  That is not a point of order, Senator Brandis; it's a debating point. For both Senator Farrell's information and the Attorney-General's information, there are other avenues where you can have the record corrected or you can at least claim to have it corrected. Senator Di Natale, you have the call.</span>
              </p>

                    <span class="HPS-MemberContinuation">Senator DI NATALE:</span>
                  </a>  So the test isn't whether someone chooses to believe they've done the right thing. If that were the test, we'd have to assume that everybody within the system was acting with integrity. We have anticorruption bodies in state parliaments across the country because we know that there are some members of this chamber and other chambers across the country who don't do the right thing. I personally believe that the overwhelming majority of members of this place and the other place do do the right thing, but we cannot rely on the goodwill of each and every individual member of this parliament to ensure that the right thing is done. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">In this instance there are serious questions around Senator Roberts. The right thing, the decent thing, the honourable thing, would have been yesterday, when these other matters were dealt with, for Senator Roberts to have been referred by One Nation to the High Court. Instead, under duress at a minute to midnight, with a motion put forward by the Australian Greens about to pass the Senate, we had a mea culpa from One Nation—'We better do this.' That's not good enough.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">There are still many questions hanging over other members of this place and the other place. It's remarkable now that it is One Nation who have proposed to support the Greens' position for an independent audit conducted of every member of parliament to ensure that they are, indeed, eligible to stand as representatives of the federal parliament. It's absolutely remarkable now that we have One Nation setting a higher standard than the Liberal Party and the Labor Party. There is no clearer example of the closed shop that happens when they know that they are coming under scrutiny. We see the Labor Party and the Liberal Party, the Coles and Woolies of politics, coming together to protect themselves.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">What we need now more than ever is transparency and accountability within our democracy. It has fallen on us, the Greens, to inject some transparency and some accountability into the closed shop that we see from both of the major parties, so shortly we will be putting forward a motion, not just regarding Senator Roberts but requiring each and every individual senator and member of parliament to ensure that they are eligible to stand here. If One Nation can support it then surely the standard that they set can be met by the Labor Party and the Liberal Party, and the test of that will come very soon.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Victoria</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">15:54</span>):  I will be supporting the One Nation motion to have the eligibility of Senator Roberts referred to the High Court acting as the Court of Disputed Returns. I did try for a different outcome yesterday and, as I said at the time in a statement, I had met with a number of my crossbench colleagues and with the Greens leader Senator Di Natale. I also had a sit-down with Senator Roberts. He told me that a statutory declaration was provided to the Senate President, addressing the question of his eligibility under s44, and he actually read me parts of that stat dec. Senator Roberts personally assured me that the claim he had travelled on a British passport was wrong and that he had travelled on his mother's Australian passport. He said he was confident that he had taken all reasonable steps to confirm his sole Australian citizenship and that a QC's advice was that it would pass the scrutiny in the High Court. When it goes to the High Court, we will see. But following further information I have received in the past 24 hours, I now believe—and I won't get you to pull me up, so I won't say that the senator lied to me, I will just say—he was economical with the truth.</span>

I initiated, and I continue to support, such a review for impartial and independent assessment of citizenship. That is contrary to Senator Di Natale's statement just a few minutes ago—completely contrary. And I remind senators here that Senator Pauline Hanson's One Nation Party 19 years ago started earnestly to question citizenship. This is not something that we come to as Johnny-come-lately. This is something that we started 19 years ago and, in this instance, I started.</span>

Before I signed that nomination form, I checked and took all reasonable steps that I believed necessary. I am accountable to the people I serve—the people of Queensland and Australia. Sadly, though, as I expected, and as the media has confirmed, elements of the media have misrepresented my position and statement—not once, not twice—repeatedly. Sadly, some senators have made false statements based on media claims. That is all they have. It is clear that MPs won't allow a review body. It seems highly unlikely that the review that I initiated, and that the Greens are now pursuing, won't occur. That leaves me with only one option for a fair hearing, and that is the High Court where I will be pleased to tender my documents.</span>

I am very confident I am eligible because otherwise I would not have signed that nomination form. In the days and weeks ahead, I look forward to other senators and MPs born overseas, or with parents or grandparents of foreign citizenship, following my lead. I am confident of my case and look forward to the process ahead. For now, though, it is business as usual. We have a lot of work to do in the Senate serving the people of Queensland, and Australia.</span>

One of my core functions is I protect the Senate and I protect the interests of the Senate. The interests of the Senate will be best served when we operate with a full complement and when we have the certainty of the eligibility of senators within this chamber. So I add my voice to that and say that I would like this matter dealt with as soon as possible without, in any way whatsoever, casting any disrespect on the manner in which the High Court, acting in the court as the Court of Disputed Returns, will act. But the Senate and the democracy of this country are best served if the matter is resolved quickly.</span>

                  </a>  Labor has no option but to oppose this motion, because it claims that the Reef 2050 plan is being delivered early. This government is not delivering early for the environment or for the reef. This government is failing on climate change, and the Liberal National Party in Queensland voted against reef protections aimed at limiting tree clearing. The Liberal-National Party chose to protect its mates who want to bulldoze trees and native vegetation, rather than protecting Australia's iconic Great Barrier Reef. It isn't the fault of the state government in Queensland that land-clearing regulations haven't been updated. This position that damages the reef by increased sediment run-off from land to the reef is being championed by the Liberal-National Party. The Queensland government put in legislation to strengthen land-clearing laws to halt the broadscale clearing of remnant vegetation which is destroying key wildlife habitat and contributing to climate change, but the Liberal-National Party voted against the legislation and reef protection. At the time, Labor in Queensland made it clear that the Liberal-National Party have abandoned the reef plan and that the Palaszczuk government remains 100 per cent committed to it. <span style="font-style:italic;">(Time expired)</span></span>

                  </a>  I don't think the Manager of Opposition Business actually read the motion. It doesn't say what she says it says. All it says is the Senate acknowledges that the World Heritage Committee of the UN endorsed Australia's Reef 2050 Plan and progress made to implement the plan. So, that's been endorsed by the UN. The decision recognises Australia's significant efforts and investment in an early and effective implementation of the Reef 2050 Plan. Again, we're just asking to note that this is what the UN has said. Also, the motion says that the World Heritage Committee—and we particularly want people to note—has not put the Great Barrier Reef on its endangered watch list. That's what we're asking the Senate to note.</span>

Right now, we're seeing them rush headlong into giving $1 billion of taxpayers' money away to the Adani coalmine. There is no plan from this government to deal with climate change, and therefore there is no plan from this government to protect the Great Barrier Reef. <span style="font-style:italic;">(Time expired)</span></span>

                  </span>

                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">Mr President, I thank the Senate for the opportunity to introduce the Australian Broadcasting Corporation Amendment (Regional Australia) Bill 2017. The purpose of the Bill is to make three changes to the Australian Broadcasting Corporation Act 1983. First, the Bill adds a provision requiring the ABC to ensure that at least 35 per cent of the Corporation's expenditure in a financial year is applied in making payments to people in regional, rural or remote parts of Australia. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">Second, the Bill adds an additional item to be included in the annual report of the Corporation, namely, the amount of money applied in making payments to people in regional, rural and remote parts of Australia. Third, the Bill includes a transitional provision that applies if the Act does not commence on the first day of a financial year. In that event, the period from the commencement of the Bill to the end of the then current financial year is treated as if it were a financial year for the purpose of the amended provision.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">At present, the ABC spends just 17 per cent of its revenue for the benefit of people working outside the capital cities where 35 per cent of the Australian population resides. Consistent with that imbalance, the ABC reflects the concerns and interests of people living in our capital cities at the expense of the population in regional, rural and remote Australia. The Bill seeks to restore the balance at the ABC between the city and the bush by requiring the ABC to direct 35 per cent of budget expenditure to the places where 35 per cent of the population resides.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">Restoring the balance between the city and the bush at the ABC is not just a matter of justice and equity, Mr President, but also of recognising the unique contribution of the bush to Australian culture and values. Why should the cities get the lion's share of ABC funding when so much of our history and cultural identity is represented by the bush? It should also be said that the unique character of rural, remote and regional Australia owes much to the talented people who live in communities outside the major cities. The ABC would benefit from the creative input of those people, as would the audiences who support the ABC.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">It seems to me that the national broadcaster should defend our national values and ABC management will be much better placed to achieve this objective if its programs reflect the values of a broad cross-section of the community, and not just the hopes and aspirations of people who live in the capital cities. Much of the material broadcast on the ABC is produced in rural, regional and remote parts of the rest of the world, especially in the United Kingdom, and it always struck me as rather odd that our national broadcaster has no problem recognising the appeal of this material except on its own doorstep.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">One reason the national broadcaster fails to reflect a broad cross-section of the community in its programming is that increasingly the ABC is dominated by city people who naturally enough project city values. I was hardly surprised to learn just a couple of weeks ago from Jennifer Oriel at <span style="font-style:italic;">The Australian</span> that research at the Sunshine Coast University found that 41.2 per cent of ABC staff surveyed voted for the Greens. While this figure may be representative of Greens voters in privileged parts of our capital cities, the Greens vote struggles to get to double figures in rural and regional Australia. This lack of diversity at the ABC is the reason that the bush is deprived of broadcasting funds.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">If the ABC were a commercial broadcaster there might be some small justification for the failure to apply funds proportionally between the bush the capital cities. Commercial broadcasters need to make a profit which is impossible in areas of low density population. For example, free-to-air television news and current affairs budgets in the bush are just 10 per cent of capital city budgets. But the national broadcaster is supposed to serve the public interest as articulated in the ABC Charter, not commercial interests. The ABC should broadcast programs that contribute to the national identity and reflect Australia's cultural diversity. I contend that directing just 17 per cent of revenue to rural, regional and remote areas representing 35 per cent of our population is contrary to the ABC Charter and against the public interest. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">Mr President, I wonder whether the ABC is ignoring the bush as part of a wider agenda to compete with commercial broadcasters. Just last week Darren Davidson reported in <span style="font-style:italic;">The Australian</span> that the ABC outbid the Australian Associated Press for a lucrative contract to supply an outdoor advertising company with syndicated news feeds. In the same article, the journalist reports other television broadcasters complaining that the ABC, with its $1.04 billion in base funding, is outbidding Channel Seven and Channel Nine networks and Foxtel for programming more suited to pay television services and commercial networks. If the ABC has so much money to spend, why not spend some of it in the bush?</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">The importance of a strong and independent public broadcaster cannot be overstated. People trust the ABC especially in times of emergency. We assume that what we see or hear on the public broadcaster has not been compromised by commercial interests. In the same vein, we expect to see or hear important news and to be entertained and educated without the frustration of interruption from commercial advertising. It is often said that the ABC is a public service we are entitled to access without direct cost. We value the fact that <span style="font-style:italic;">our</span> ABC broadcasts programs that are not determined by advertisers looking for large audiences to sell their products and services. ABC content is not subject to the dictates of commercial interests, and commercial interests should not be allowed to starve regional, rural and remote Australia of the funds required to serve the public interest recognised in the ABC Charter. I commend the Bill to the Senate, Mr President.</span>

We are yet to receive that advice, and we call on the Queensland government to supply this information as soon as possible. It is important to note, however, that the coalition government is already funding 75 per cent of Cyclone Debbie's damage bill, currently estimated to amount to $683 million, and it has provided more than $16.8 million to individuals through Commonwealth-only disaster payments. Our disaster arrangements exist to alleviate damage caused as a direct result of a disaster, not fund new large-scale infrastructure projects. We have a responsibility to Australian taxpayers to ensure these vital funds are used appropriately.</span>

                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">Inequality is one of the greatest challenges we face; income inequality is growing in Australia and many people battle daily with meeting basic living expenses and poverty. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">Inequality creates significant negative effects on individuals' physical and mental wellbeing, societal cohesion and stability, and economic growth and productivity. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">Currently there are 2.99 million people (13.3% of the population) living below the poverty line in Australia, after taking account of their housing costs. 731,300 of these are children. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">Poverty and inequality have devastating impacts on life outcomes. Poverty undermines access to education and training, and educational outcomes are directly correlated with socio-economic status. Poverty limits access to safe, secure and appropriate housing, transport, employment outcomes, childcare, and many other aspects of full participation in society. Poverty is a daily challenge for many Australians, undermining their ability to have meaningful and productive lives. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">What is incredibly saddening is that the number of people falling into poverty is increasing and that those most likely to find themselves living below the poverty line are already facing the most disadvantage. We are a wealthy country and have the resources available to us to significantly reduce the existing rate of poverty, if only there was the political will to do so. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">No one in a country as rich as Australia should be living in poverty.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">Of those on income support, 36.1% are living below the poverty line, including 55% of people receiving Newstart Allowance.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">The Australian Greens want a stronger social safety net and adequate income support payments. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">A strong social safety net is the foundation of a more inclusive and productive society. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">We need visionary policy to overcome the underlying drivers of poverty, such as affordable housing, access to education and employment, and we need to ensure we have a strong social security system, that properly supports people, and is fit to meet the challenges we face in the 21st Century. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">A strong social safety net is a key part of addressing inequality. A social safety net ensures that when people fall on hard times there are supports in place to help them when they need it most. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">The changing nature of work – increasing part-time and casual employment, under-employment, short-term contracts and uncertain weekly incomes – means that we need a twenty-first century social safety net that is more flexible and responsive. Such a system is better suited to supporting people to maintain their financial resilience as they move in and out of work, and copes better with variable and uncertain income. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">This is why many modern and progressive societies are adopting more flexible and responsive social security systems as a way of ensuring their economies remain competitive, their communities stable, and their workers better able to respond productively to rapidly changing workplaces and technologies. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">Australia's income support system is complex, inadequate, punitive and difficult to navigate. The Greens are committed to developing a twenty-first century social safety net that supports a productive workforce and an inclusive community. Quite simply people who are unemployed and on Newstart are struggling to survive because the payment is inadequate and puts them below the poverty line, poverty itself, is a barrier to employment.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">The evidence provided to the committee inquiry <span style="font-style:italic;">Bridging our growing divide: inequality in Australia. The extent of income inequality in Australia</span> in 2014 showed that the level of the Newstart payment is too low. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">In conclusion, the report found that: </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">It is clear that income is a key factor in determining the economic wellbeing most Australians. A low income or low transfer payments will often exacerbate the disadvantage suffered by a person and their dependants. Take the case of a retrenched worker who may be forced to live on savings or the <span style="font-style:italic;">Newstart </span>allowance for a period of time. This may mean foregoing health services with out of pocket expenses, refinancing a mortgage or ending childcare or private school tuition for their children. A more prolonged period of unemployment may lead to despondency, mental health problems, marital breakdown and homelessness. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">Australia's key unemployment payment, Newstart, hasn't had a real, legislated increase in over two decades.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">A single person on Newstart receiving the maximum payment has to live on $38.39 (including the energy supplement) a day. This is less than half the minimum wage. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">The Australian Greens have long been calling for an increase to Newstart and had a bill in the previous two parliaments to increase the single rates of Newstart and independent Youth Allowance. Leading community organisations, business and the community have all called repeatedly to increase this inadequate payment. Despite this, both Liberal and Labor governments have failed to act. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">Instead, the Government has successively hacked away at the income support system, reducing much needed support. Instead, the Government has deliberately and maliciously propagated myths and is demonising those accessing income support, without any compassion or understanding of the reality of living below the poverty line. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">The fact is, there are not enough jobs. According to the ABS in February 2017, there were 186,400 job vacancies in Australia while there were 743,700 people who were unemployed. Young people are more than twice as likely to be unemployed. </span>

                  <span class="HPS-Small">Humiliating, demonising and attacking people makes life harder and helps to trap people in poverty, making it more difficult for people to re-enter the workforce. We recognise that single people living on Newstart and independent Youth Allowance are the ones who are typically the most disadvantaged by our current income support system. The maximum fortnightly payment of Newstart for a single person with no dependent children at the time of the Bill's introduction is $535.60; $338.60 less per fortnight than the maximum rate of payment for singles (including the Pension Supplement) on the age and disability pensions. The maximum fortnightly payment for Youth Allowance (living away from home) is $437.50; $98.10 less per fortnight than the rate of Newstart for a single person with no dependent children. </span>

                  <span class="HPS-Small">For single Newstart recipients, it does this by introducing a Newstart supplement of $110 a fortnight. For single, independent Youth Allowance recipients, the maximum basic rates are increased by $110 a fortnight. </span>

                  <span class="HPS-Small">The focus on singles is based on evidence that these households are the most at risk of poverty. The ACOSS report <span style="font-style:italic;">Poverty in Australia 2016</span> found that single people generally faced a significantly higher risk of poverty than couples (24.6% to 10.1%), while 33.2% of single parent families are living in poverty (compared with 11.3% of couples with children). This reflects, in part, the economies of scale available to people living with partners. </span>

Despite the finding, the Liberal and Labor parties refused to take action, the Greens then, and now, are the only party calling for a raise in this inadequate payment. </span>

                  <span class="HPS-Small">The gap between the allowance and pension payments is increasing. Newstart Allowance is indexed to movements in the CPI in March and September each year and Youth Allowance is indexed to the CPI once a year in January. Pensions are indexed twice a year (in March and September) by the greater of the movement in the CPI or the PBLCI—an index designed to better reflect the price changes affecting pensioners—and the rate is also benchmarked to a percentage of Male Total Average Weekly Earnings. </span>

                  <span class="HPS-Small">A $110 increase to the eligible payments will ensure a fairer and more straightforward social security system, and immediately help Australian people who are living in poverty on these income support payments. Better indexation will help maintain the value of an increase into the future. </span>

                  </a>  It is very unusual for a motion to be supported by the Labor Party and Senators Bernardi, Gichuhi, Hanson-Young and Xenophon, but this cross-party group of South Australian senators are coming together to demand a real inquiry into the Murray-Darling Basin. It is utterly clear that this government, under this Prime Minister, is not working to deliver the Murray-Darling Basin Plan in full. It is utterly clear, yet again, that the Deputy Prime Minister does not have the best interests of the basin at heart, as evidenced by his statements in the Shepparton pub that Senator Bernardi and others have spoken about, and it is clear that this Prime Minister, to date, has not been willing to do the right thing and make Mr Joyce do the right thing. I thank the Greens and Senators Bernardi, Gichuhi and Xenophon for their support. </span>

                  </a>  I think it's a very important and unique show of voices from South Australian senators here today that we are all standing up for the health of the Murray-Darling Basin. We at the bottom end of the river system know how hard it is to keep upstream states in line when it comes to sharing water fairly. To hear that some people—some rich, greedy, corporate irrigators—with a wink and a nod from the NSW government, are now stealing water from the river, is something that must be investigated. No-one has any faith in the Murray-Darling Basin Authority or NSW government investigating themselves. The reason we need a judicial inquiry is that the NSW government cannot be trusted and neither can Barnaby Joyce.</span>

                    </a>  The government opposes the motion. The calling into question a senator's eligibility to sit in this place is a very serious step and that step should only be taken in cases where there is a clear case to answer. The motion seeks to turn this long accepted principle on its head, effectively calling into question every senator's position until he or she is able to provide conclusive proof of his or her citizenship status. This would constitute a wrong-headed reversal of the onus of proof, especially given the undoubted public interest in certainty as to the composition of parliament. Further, another referral would only add to the existing workloads of Senate committees and the committee secretariats in particular.</span>

                    </a>  It's not this motion or, indeed, the Greens that are calling into question the eligibility of senators; it is the community and the scrutiny that has been occurring in the media for several months now. Calling into question the eligibility of senators is something that ordinary punters out there are doing right now. It's no wonder they have no faith in the system. There's a very straightforward process: an independent auditor to ensure that people in this parliament are eligible to stand. Where there are question marks, they will be referred to the High Court. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">At the moment, we are relying on our friends in the media to do the job that this Senate should be doing—transparency and accountability. What we have are question marks being raised over individuals when we could be doing it through a process endorsed by this Senate. That's why this is so critical. It's taken the Greens and the crossbench to shine a light where the major parties refuse it to be shone.</span>

                    </a>  It is an honour to be a senator, and it's your job and right to make sure you are entitled to be elected to be one. As somebody said, 'If the human headline can check it out and fix it, it can't be that hard!' That should stand for everybody else in this place and the other place. It is your job. Being ignorant of it not being applicable, doesn't hold water. Senator Lambie is right when she says, 'Out there, general trust and respect for politicians in this place is very low.' If you won't have the guts to get up there and suddenly say: 'Yes, I'll show you. I'm an Australian. I was born here. I've denounced my other citizenship,' then I think it's shameful that you hide behind that. It's not much for Senator Di Natale and the other crossbenchers to say: 'Listen, get your house in order. Otherwise, if we don't, we are treated like a joke.'</span>

                  </a>  I rise to support Senator Whish-Wilson's motion concerning AUSTRAC's action against the Commonwealth Bank of Australia—otherwise known as the CBA. The civil penalty proceedings initiated in the Federal Court against the CBA for serious and systemic noncompliance under the Anti-Money Laundering and Counter-Terrorism Financing Act 2016 shows that the CBA has become the bank of choice for terrorists and criminals. CBA should be renamed the Criminal Bank of Australia, given the more than 53,000 violations of law that have been alleged. As soon as time allows, I will be moving my personal banking out of the CBA into a local credit union. I suggest that others do the same. This is the only way the big boys at the CBA will take notice. I will not support a bank that supports terrorists.</span>

                  </a>  Labor will not be supporting this motion. We did put some sensible amendments to the Greens, including inserting the word 'allegations' throughout the motion, as these are currently allegations that will be prosecuted and tested within the Federal Court. We also do not believe that it's the appropriate role of the Senate to give a view on the pay and pay outcomes of particular private companies or individuals. We made a further suggestion that this motion be amended to include Labor's policy of establishing a royal commission into Australia's banks, as we believe that is the only way to get to the bottom of the systemic failures and cultural issues within the financial services sector. Unfortunately, the Greens were not prepared to accept those amendments. It is for those reasons that we cannot support the motion today.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Small">The need to establish an independent national judicial inquiry through the Council of Australian Governments following allegations of theft and corruption in management of water resources in the Barwon-Darling Basin.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">A healthy River Murray is vital to my state's future. Our communities and our economy depend on the river like no other state, and we see firsthand what happens when those upstream act inappropriately. That's why, historically, South Australia has fought so hard to achieve a Murray-Darling Basin Plan—to ensure the future health of the basin, which is essential to protecting the communities, the industries and the environment that depend on it. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The explosive allegations aired on <span style="font-style:italic;">Four Corners</span> two weeks ago were shocking to us, particularly those farmers and irrigators who consider the river their heartland. The allegations point to what we fear—that too many upstream continue to undermine a plan which is so important to protecting our river. These fears have only been validated by the arrogant, uncaring and dismissive response from this government, exemplified markedly by the man supposed to be in charge, as minister, of the Murray-Darling Basin Plan. What did the Deputy Prime Minister and Minister for Agriculture and Water Resources, Barnaby Joyce, have to say? What did he say to political supporters over a beer in a Shepparton pub? He tried to paint the <span style="font-style:italic;">Four Corners</span> investigation as an attempt to create 'a calamity for which the solution is trying to take more water off you'. That's the Deputy Prime Minister and minister for water dismissing allegations of theft and corruption as a calamity not for the river, not for the Basin Plan, but for those accused of the responsibility. It's like blaming the police for Ned Kelly robbing the bank. What's worse, he actually celebrated his ability to dismiss such allegations, to push them aside, saying 'I'm glad it's our portfolio, a National Party portfolio, because we can go out and say, "No, we're not going to follow on that. We're not going to scare you."' </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The next day, Minister Joyce dismissed reports of theft and corruption in the Murray-Darling Basin as modern-day cattle-rustling. He doesn't seem to understand that being federal minister for water isn't about promoting the interests of his mates in The Nationals by making light of potentially criminal or corrupt behaviour; it's about showing leadership on behalf of all people who rely on that river system. Of course, we shouldn't be surprised by Mr Joyce's response. He did, after all, campaign against the Murray-Darling Basin Plan, telling those suffering to move where the water is. And, even his own coalition colleagues expressed concern when he was given control of the water portfolio by Mr Turnbull. Tony Pasin, the Liberal member for Barker, said that he was 'concerned about the fact that we now have a deeper involvement by the National Party with respect to the implementation of the plan'. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">What have we seen from Mr Turnbull? We have seen the usual inability to stand up for anything he previously believed in and previously fought for. On this issue, like on so many others, he's again caved—on this occasion, to The Nationals and the Deputy Prime Minister. Mr Turnbull's response to the allegations of corruption and theft was to announce a compliance review that can't compel witnesses to appear, that doesn't allow evidence to be taken under oath, that doesn't allow documents to be compelled and won't protect whistleblowers. He used to be a strong and passionate advocate for reform of the Murray-Darling Basin. He used to. But now he stands meekly behind Mr Joyce in rejecting any sensible response to these serious allegations. It is yet another act of weakness, yet another absence of leadership from Mr Turnbull.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Today in the parliament, senators from all parties in South Australia, bar one, jointly moved and supported a motion calling for a national judicial inquiry into the allegations of theft and corruption I've described. It comes after the South Australian Labor government and Senators Xenophon, Bernardi, Hanson-Young and I stood together on this issue. It speaks to the importance we place upon this. That South Australians from a wide set of political perspectives could unite on this issue shows a solemn depth of concern. The one party not supporting our collective call for an inquiry is the Liberals, who yet again are putting their National Party mates in other states ahead of the people they're elected to represent in this place and ahead of the people of South Australia.</span>

                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Senator RUSTON</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">South Australia</span>—<span class="HPS-MinisterialTitles">Assistant Minister for Agriculture and Water Resources</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">17:04</span>):  Can I firstly make it very, very clear to this chamber that the federal government—and that includes every one of my colleagues in this place and the other place from South Australia—take the allegations that were made on the <span style="font-style:italic;">Four Corners</span> program about corruption and the management of water resources in the Barwon-Darling catchment very, very seriously. But this should not be a competition about who is more outraged about the allegations. This actually should be about determining the validity of the allegations, determining the magnitude of any breaches, taking action against the authority or any person who's broken the law, and making sure that we put things in place so that this does not happen again. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I have a question for those who are supporting this motion: what exactly is it that you want to investigate that's not being covered by the separate inquiries already underway? We have the NSW independent inquiry headed up by Ken Matthews, an eminent person who used to head up the National Water Commission, who's investigating the very specific allegations of the <span style="font-style:italic;">Four Corners</span> program. We have the Murray-Darling Basin Authority basin-wide review into compliance with state-based regulations governing water use. It also should be noted that the MDBA has some very extensive powers for information gathering under the Water Act. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We have the ANAO review into how the Department of Agriculture and Water Resources is monitoring the performance of NSW regarding the protection of environmental water. And we have the NSW ICAC, where all allegations have been referred to. It should be noted that the NSW ICAC have the powers to compel the production of documents; they have the powers to compel a public authority or an official to provide evidence; they have the powers to enter property occupied by a public authority or an official to inspect or copy documents; they have the authority to obtain search warrants; they have the authority to use surveillance devices; and they have the ability to compel witnesses to answer questions—but, most importantly, they hold the majority of their hearings in public. They've jailed ministers and they've seen off a premier. They are an extraordinarily powerful organisation. I ask again: what is it that you are actually seeking to investigate that isn't currently being investigated by the four separate inquiries that I have just outlined?</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">All of these inquiries are underway and we're expecting the initial report from the NSW inquiry before the end of the month. The Murray-Darling Basin inquiry is required to report by December. The referrals to ICAC and the ANAO have already occurred. A royal commission—which is basically what those opposite and those people supporting this urgency motion today are basically asking for—will take months and months and months to establish and will cost tens of millions of dollars. I know that the communities that I represent and the communities along the Murray-Darling Basin want quick answers. They want quick resolutions. I seriously believe that they do not want us to be playing politics with this particular issue.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">However, I must say that I was particularly pleased that, following these allegations, the South Australian Labor government has apparently rediscovered its desire for openness and transparency. A South Australian government minister said:</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Small">The Commonwealth Government needs to step in to ensure public confidence in an open, transparent and full investigation …</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I assume this means that the South Australian government will ensure public confidence by allowing open, transparent and full investigations into many other issues, such as the abuse allegations at the Oakden aged-care facility, the land sale at Gillman or the ongoing scandals involving Families SA or the Department for Child Protection. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The SA government can't credibly call for openness and transparency in New South Wales when it denies the very same openness and transparency in its own state. Only last month, the South Australian government actually voted down a bill to allow the South Australian ICAC to hold public hearings into the Oakden facility. When questioned why he supported transparency in this particular water inquiry but was quite happy to vote down transparency when it came to the inquiry into the Oakden facility, the Premier actually responded, 'It's just a separate matter that has different considerations.' He then went on to accuse the NSW ICAC of 'unfairly staining reputations' because it holds its hearings in public. I haven't heard those opposite calling out for the South Australian government to guarantee transparency in any of its actions. You know, you guys, you can't just be convenient; you have to be consistent if you're going to have any credibility in this space.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Most importantly, we need to get on with the job of delivering a plan. Nobody's interests are going to be served by the stalling of the plan—or, worse still, blowing it up. It's taken us 100 years to get to the table to agree to the actions that are needed to have a sustainable Murray-Darling Basin system, and we mustn't let all this fantastic work be derailed just because we decide that we're going to play a political game. Through cooperation and collaboration, we've got to where we are, and I have to say there's some really good news out there—great news. As of 30 June this year we had already recovered 2,083 gigalitres of water. That's in addition to the 600-plus gigalitres of water we've been able to secure through the STL adjustment mechanism. That's water that's been achieved through efficiency measures, which means it has not been taken out of productive use. It hasn't been taken out of the communities like the one that I live in, which is supported totally by the irrigation capacity that is delivered by the Murray-Darling Basin. I'd like to think that maybe somebody else who is going to stand up in this place actually has firsthand understanding and knowledge of the consequences of this plan not going forward. I doubt they do.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We also put in place the 1,500 gigalitre cap on buyback, to make sure we didn't continue to strip the very essence and ability from our communities and actually send them broke. We are on target to deliver our targets for 2019, when we said that we would have delivered 2,750 gigalitres of water for the sole use of the environment. That is a great track record. That is a good-news story, and I think it is very sad that we are standing here today jeopardising and potentially derailing what we have worked so hard together to try to achieve. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">What I would say to this place is: we are but five years into the 12 years of implementation of the Murray-Darling Basin Plan. We are on track and have achieved a huge amount. We have achieved this because we have worked together, all jurisdictions—Queensland, New South Wales, Victoria, South Australia, the ACT and the Commonwealth—have worked together, and we are on track to deliver this plan that is so vitally important to every single community that lives along the river. It is also vitally important that we have a sustainable river system for those communities. We have worked together over the last five years to get to the place we are now. We have another seven years before we've delivered this plan in full. We sit here today on the edge of the cliff, deciding whether we are going to blow this plan up with politics or whether we are all going to get back together and make sure that we deliver this plan in full. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I can give this chamber an absolutely unconditional guarantee that it is my sole objective to deliver this plan. I'm not going to play politics with it; I'm not going to play games. I actually want to sit down and deliver this plan, because I believe it is the fundamental responsibility of every single person in this place to honour the commitment of those that went before us. When the Labor Party and the coalition got together and decided that we were going to implement this plan, it was a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity for cooperation between the two major parties to deliver an outcome that was so terribly needed.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I find it extraordinary that we should even be considering not going back to the table and having a discussion about how we can get past this unfortunate situation that has been alleged by <span style="font-style:italic;">Four Corners</span>. We need to deal with that, no question at all, but let's not play politics. We need to deliver this plan. We need to deliver this plan for the benefit of the river. We need to deliver this plan for the benefit of the communities that rely on this river. But most particularly, we need to deliver this plan for the broader benefit of all Australians. The food bowl of Australia exists in the Murray-Darling Basin. The economic activity that's generated within this particular area is massive, and every Australian benefits when the Murray-Darling Basin is doing what it can do best. We have seen massive water efficiencies and massive productive efficiencies occur through the delivery of the first five years of this plan. The opportunities to make this an absolute first-class, state-of-the-art food bowl for the world absolutely exist. I would like to think that everybody in this place will stand with me. Let's get back to the table and come up with an agreement so that we can put these allegations behind us, deal with them, and get on with delivering the Murray-Darling Basin Plan in full, on time, on budget, for the benefit of every single Australian.</span>

                  <a href="111206" type="MemberSpeech">
                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Senator LEYONHJELM</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">New South Wales</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">17:14</span>):  The millennium drought led some to conclude that drought was the new normal and the environment was facing catastrophe. The drought ended with widespread flooding. Dorothea Mackellar's 'Australia, a land of droughts and flooding rains' was never better demonstrated. However, during the drought, a plan was devised to release water from agriculture to save the environment. The result was one per cent science and 99 per cent politics. The plan calls for the return of 2,750 gigalitres of water to the environment, with a further 450 gigalitres to be returned subject to certain conditions. Since it began in 2012, water rights have been purchased from farmers in Queensland, New South Wales and Victoria, plus a small quantity from South Australia.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">In the last parliament, I chaired a Senate inquiry into its effects, with hearings in each of the participating states. We found the loss of irrigation water was hurting rural communities. Farms no longer grew irrigated crops such as fruit or pasture. They required far fewer inputs and generated far less income. Workers had lost their jobs and moved away. Regional communities had fewer schoolchildren and volunteer firefighters, and customers in local shops. We also found a very poor understanding of the plan. Many people had an almost religious belief that the environment simply needs water, irrespective of whether it's in the right place at the right time or in the right quantities. It was even worse in South Australia. Its outrage over allegations that water is being misappropriated from the Darling and Barwon rivers in New South Wales is ridiculous, given that these rivers often run dry and only about six per cent of the water in these two rivers ever gets to South Australia.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Perhaps the most disturbing aspect of the inquiry was hearing how 900 gigalitres of water taken from productive agriculture in Victoria and New South Wales evaporate in Lake Alexandrina and Lake Albert in South Australia. If Lake Alexandrina was allowed to remain open to the sea and subject to tidal influences rather than being kept closed by man-made barrages, it could be sea water that evaporates, not fresh water. Preserving an artificial environment at the expense of farming and rural communities seems very poor public policy. The Murray-Darling Basin Plan was conceived in panic and is seriously flawed. Its intentions are laudable, but it is not Holy Writ. There's enormous scope for improvement.</span>

Being a matter of urgency debate, people speak for different periods of time. I noticed that Senator Ruston is the speaker for the longest time on this list. The people of South Australia were listening intently, I am sure—we are being broadcast at the moment. They were listening for Senator Ruston to say one thing to this Senate—that she would join all of the other people from South Australia and all of other political parties who are calling on a judicial inquiry in respect to the theft and the corruption in New South Wales of water in the Murray-Darling Basin.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I just want to go through the number of political parties that are supporting this motion. We have the Labor Party, of course, led by Senator Wong. We have Senator Bernardi, a former member of the Liberal Party. Even he recognises that something needs to be done about the theft and the corruption of water from the Murray-Darling Basin. Even Senator Gichuhi, a new senator who hasn't been in the Senate for very long, understands that we need to do something about this issue. What a combination—Senator Bernardi and Senator Hanson-Young are on a unity ticket on this issue! And, of course, we have Senator Xenophon.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">What political party is missing? Well, it's the party that's always missing when it comes to the Murray-Darling Basin. It's the Liberal Party. They are nowhere to be seen. I'm pleased that Senator Smith is in the chamber at the moment. We heard Senator Ruston say, 'We shouldn't be playing politics with this issue.' That's exactly what we should be doing with this. We should be playing politics. Those Liberals from South Australia—and I'm looking directly at Senator Birmingham now—should be following the path of Senator Smith. They should be laying down the law to their colleagues and saying, 'There's an issue here that we need to be dealing with.' We saw what Senator Smith did with the issue of same-sex marriage. Those senators from South Australia in the Liberal Party should be jumping up and down day and night about what's gone on here. There's a scandal here. Water from the Murray-Darling Basin has been stolen by upstream irrigators—water that should've gone back into the environment to rescue the Murray-Darling Basin.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">For 100 years, the problems of the Murray-Darling Basin were ignored. They finally got dealt with in that golden period of Australian politics—yes, I am talking about the Gillard government—when lots of things got done for the betterment of this country. That was a golden era—I see Senator Birmingham's making some notes here—of Australian politics when Tony Burke, for the first time in our history, fixed the problems of the Murray-Darling Basin. I had the privilege at that time of being his understudy. I was the Parliamentary Secretary for Sustainability and Urban Water. It was a great day and Tony Burke built on the terrific work that Senator Penny Wong had done in this portfolio. For the first time we started to restore our great river system—our inland river system—to good health. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We need the Liberals from South Australia to stand up and recognise that there's a problem here. We can't have Barnaby Joyce as our water minister. We can't have that. He is not serious about restoring the health of the Murray-Darling Basin. We need those senators from South Australia—and lower house members of parliament, but particularly the senators—to stand up. Follow the example of Senator Smith. Jump up and down in your caucus. We need to get something done. <span style="font-style:italic;">(Time expired)</span></span>

                  </a>  What about John Howard? What a very good question there, Senator Hume. The Water Act 2007 was passed by the water minister at the time. Who was the water minister in 2007? Malcolm Turnbull was the water minister in 2007. He passed the Water Act—brought that into being—with John Howard and budgeted $10 billion to be able to deliver the Murray-Darling Basin Plan. He put into law the process that led to that plan.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Mr Burke, Ms Gillard and others followed through on the implementation of it, and I give them credit for it. I was proud—as a frontbencher in the opposition with the responsibility for water—to at times work with Mr Burke to make sure that the Water Act, which had been passed in a bipartisan spirit, saw the Murray-Darling Basin Plan delivered in a bipartisan spirit. In government, we are determined to make sure that the Murray-Darling Basin Plan is implemented in full and on time—no ifs, no buts; full delivery.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I can assure this Senate that I will never, ever let anything get in the way of the successful implementation of the Murray-Darling Basin Plan. It is essential to our home state. It is something that our government is deeply committed to delivering. It is something that the Prime Minister, Mr Turnbull, as the author of the Water Act—and the person who started the process of putting in place a comprehensive management plan for the Murray-Darling that, for the first time ever, actually analyses the Basin regardless of arbitrary state borders, which of course rivers don't recognise—is determined to see it fully implemented, and fully implemented it will be under a Turnbull government.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">What we're seeing here today is a political stunt. You can tell it's a stunt, of course, when Senator Bernardi and Senator Hanson-Young pose for the cameras together. That's a pretty good sign that it's a stunt. Because of course it's an otherwise preposterous concept that those two would share a stage at any one point in time. </span>

                  </a>  Very much a parallel universe, Senator Smith. You can tell it's a stunt. It's a stunt, of course, because it's a motion and a proposal that ignores fact, ignores reality. It's dealing, yes, with a serious issue. The allegations of theft of water and of potential corruption in terms of the management of water licences in New South Wales are serious allegations. They ought to be gotten to the bottom of. If proven, there ought to be criminal charges that ensue. People ought to lose their jobs, if all of the allegations are true. That, of course, is why there have been referrals to the New South Wales Independent Commission Against Corruption. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">You want a call for a judicial inquiry into this theft of water? Well, you've have got one–you've got one already happening. The ICAC—with the powers of a royal commission, with the powers to hear from whistleblowers, with the powers to subpoena evidence and with the powers to do everything that it needs to—has been asked to look at this matter. And I think, with the New South Wales ICAC—that has brought down premiers, brought down ministers, sent public servants to jail and initiated charges in a range of different ways—you'd be pretty hard-pressed to argue that it was anything but a proper, thorough, full investigation into these allegations. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Alongside that, the New South Wales government has asked Ken Matthews, former chair of the National Water Commission—again, a man of great integrity and independence—to undertake a review. So, within the jurisdiction of New South Wales, there are two initiatives. But I challenge anybody—any of those who are supporting this initiative—to question the independence, the integrity, the thoroughness and the rigour of the New South Wales ICAC and suggest that somehow it is unable to do the things that they claim they want to see happen. Because they won't be able to challenge that. Of course it is able to do all of the things to follow up on the <span style="font-style:italic;">Four Corners</span> report. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">But our government is not content with the fact that the ICAC and Mr Matthews are undertaking their work. We also have the ANAO looking at matters with its own independence and scrutiny here in the Commonwealth. But we recognise that perhaps—what if this is not an isolated incident? What if there are some other problems in relation to the management of water licences, the integrity rate of those water licences and the integrity of water take-offs across the basin? Which is why we have proposed that there should be a more comprehensive review that sits alongside this. It's not the review to specifically deal with the one issue of instances and allegations because, if there is criminal wrongdoing there, that is exactly what the ICAC process should uncover and deal with. But the broader review is to actually give integrity and confidence back right across all of the basin states and jurisdictions—each and every one of them—and to ensure that their licensing regime and the compliance with that regime is thorough, rigorous and appropriate. To do that, under the terms of the Murray-Darling Basin management, you need the cooperation of each of those basin states. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">My colleague Senator Ruston—who now does an incredible job as the assistant Minister for Agriculture and Water, I know—is absolutely determined to see the Basin Plan, as she told this chamber before, implemented in full and on time as I outlined. I know that she is equally determined to make sure that we maintain the bipartisan commitment to this plan that has got us this far—that has got us through the passage of the Water Act under the Howard government, with Malcolm Turnbull as water minister; that got us through the Rudd-Gillard-Rudd governments, that got us through the Abbott government when I had responsibility in this place, and now with the Turnbull government.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Consistent work to see to date is: more than 2,000 billion litres of water licences successfully recovered to meet the terms of the Basin Plan. That work will only continue successfully if we have cooperation, not just bipartisan cooperation, but cooperation of each of the states and territories, as Senator Ruston so correctly and eloquently put it in her contribution. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We must make sure that we have integrity in the delivery of the plan. That's what the review that Senator Ruston, the water minister and the Prime Minister have instigated will do. We must get to the bottom of those allegations. That's what the ICAC, the powers of a royal commission, and the other reviews will do. But, ultimately, we must deliver the Basin Plan, and that's what I and every member of this government looks forward to seeing happen with the cooperation, I trust, of every other member of this chamber too. </span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">
                  <a href="8IV" type="MemberSpeech">
                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Senator XENOPHON</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">South Australia</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">17:30</span>):  I know a thing or two about stunts and I say to Senator Birmingham that this is not a stunt. Calling for a judiciary inquiry is absolutely imperative. There should be no doubt of the need for a judicial inquiry into these incredibly serious allegations, first aired on the ABC's program on 24 July. I'll address the issue of ICAC in the brief time available. Subsequent revelations in other media outlets since that broadcast have made it abundantly clear that these allegations are just the tip of the iceberg that is emerging as a major national scandal that is challenging the ethos of our Federation. Allegations of water pump tampering, water theft and rorting, collusion between officials and irrigators, failures by officials to properly monitor compliance, the shutting down of compliance units in the face of alleged noncompliance investigations, irregularity and illegality are shocking and, together, they have an overwhelming stench of corruption about them.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Subsequent revelations of attempts to retrospectively make lawful what was a flagrant breach are absolutely inexcusable. These allegations are serious because they, in effect, reveal attempts to sabotage the $13 billion Murray-Darling Basin Plan that the basin states signed up to five years ago with bipartisan commitment. And this is not about state against state or irrigator against environmentalist; it's about the very integrity of a $13 billion plan and the officials and politicians that are meant to implement it fully, thoroughly and fairly. If we are fair dinkum about the very basis of our Federation, if our Commonwealth of Australia is indeed about the common wealth of all Australians, then we must recognise how vulnerable the lower reaches of the Murray-Darling Basin are, and in my home state of South Australia particularly—something that my friend and colleague, the member for Mayo, Rebekha Sharkie MP, is acutely aware of.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">So when the government says there is no need for a judicial inquiry because of the four inquiries on foot, that is nowhere near good enough. It is an anaemic, weak excuse. The fact is that ICAC is limited in its jurisdiction, to one state in the basin, to New South Wales. It does not have the power to protect witnesses in other states that can come forward in terms of a broader inquiry about allegations beyond New South Wales—allegations that may relate to other basin states. It doesn't have the power to protect whistleblowers that a judicial inquiry has, because of the jurisdictional restrictions that it has. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">There is another issue I want to raise very briefly. I foreshadow that I will be moving, in consultation with my colleagues, for an order for the production of documents in relation to how the Water for the Environment Special Account is being spent. Right now we have one page indicating how $1.77 billion is meant to be spent in terms of the environment special account. These are matters that we must address. If we are fair dinkum about implementing this nation-building plan for the nation's food basin and to look after our irrigators and the environment in the Murray-Darling Basin, a judicial inquiry is an absolute must.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">South Australia</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">17:33</span>):  I, too, support this resolution for a judicial inquiry. At the outset, I would just like to say that I accept that Senator Ruston and Senator Birmingham have genuinely articulated their respective positions. Senator Ruston alluded to politics in this argument. Well, the politics is not coming from this side of the table. What has caused the alleged untoward activities of these upstream irrigators who have treated the Basin Plan with such disregard or alleged disregard? What's caused it are the actions of people like the Hon. Barnaby Joyce, who said on 21 November 2016, 'You have not got a hope in Hades of delivering 450 gigs—not a hope.' And, when he was asked subsequently, the Deputy Prime Minister said that the current funding for the promised 450 gigalitres was insufficient, saying, 'You have not got a hope in Hades of delivering the 450 gigs—not a hope.'</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">So the Deputy Prime Minister casts aspersions and doubt on the credibility of a plan that took 100 years to make. And then, if you throw in Senator Hanson, a person who is critical of people who don't have English as their first language—and I apologise for the verbatim <span style="font-style:italic;">Hansard</span>—this is what One Nation said:</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Small">I will tell you about this 450 gigalitres that is supposed to be on the table. That is like a guillotine over their heads. If you took away the 450, they can handle the other. They will be able to survive. They will try to do something about it. They understand about environmental. They have had to change their farming ways. But what you have done is that they feel that they are not being listened to—no-one is listening to their concerns.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">What this is really all about is the seat of Orange. The Nationals lost the seat they'd held since 1947 with a 20 per cent swing to the Shooters, Fishers and Farmers Party. In other words, the Nationals wanted to vote for anybody else but the National Party. Anybody who stood in that seat would have won except the Nationals. That's the genesis of this. Barnaby Joyce is trying to out-politic One Nation.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">One Nation comes to this parliament courtesy of a double dissolution, which is owned by the Prime Minister. No-one else can take credit for that double dissolution other than the Hon. Malcolm Turnbull. He filled the place up with One Nation. They come into this argument very late and totally misinformed. They go around the country articulating unrealistic positions, giving hope to people who really have to think about their viability in a much more professional way than having Senator Hanson come here and say, 'That's all rubbish. Why do you need more water down the Murray?' That's the level of her contribution. And the Deputy Prime Minister of Australia is actually having to outgun that position. He is having to go into a country pub and outgun Pauline Hanson's One Nation.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">It is an absolute disgrace, but that is what is happening with this Murray-Darling Basin Plan. It needs to be put back on track for the health of Australia, for the health of the river, for the health of South Australia and for everybody up and down the river. We cannot have it reduced to this level of crass politics, with the National Party trying to outdo One Nation in stupidity by advocating irrational, illogical positions.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">South Australia</span>—<span class="HPS-MinisterialTitles">Deputy Government Whip in the Senate</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">17:37</span>):  I, too, rise to speak on the issue of water because, as a South Australian, it's an issue that is vitally important to everyone in our state, whether you live in the metro area, whether you are particularly concerned about the environment, whether you are concerned about the communities along the river who make their living from the water or whether you are concerned about an adequate and reliable supply. That's why for 100 years South Australians, as part of this federation, have been concerned about water. For 100 years we have seen the inability of the various states to work together to come up with a plan. It's only this side of politics, under Prime Minister Howard and then the environment minister, Mr Turnbull, that, in 2007, came up with the vision and the plan that became the Water Act and the $10 billion that was associated with that. For the first time, there was national leadership that said, 'How can we actually put in place a system to make this work?'</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">As someone who has lived most of my professional life being an experimental test pilot, I know that the best laid plans of mice and men don't always work perfectly first time around. You have to work at them to make sure they are effective and implemented well. And by and large, whilst there have been ups and downs and issues to work through, that has occurred. One of the reasons our Federation works is that, where something does go wrong in another state, we don't suddenly have to get the federal government to fix every problem. We actually trust each other around road rules and around health systems. We're able to transfer a patient from one city to another because we actually trust the regulations. States like New South Wales oversee the bodies that regulate professional standards across Australia in terms of schemes for professional indemnity. That system works. Just because there has been the discovery of what appears to be, on the face of the reporting, illegal activity, we don't need to upend a system that has worked well for our nation.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We do have a national approach of a review. Mr Ken Matthews AO is leading the investigation from a national perspective. He was the chair and chief executive officer of the National Water Commission, so he knows the people, the system and the stakeholders. He might find examples that need to be explored further. We already have underway the New South Wales independent investigation, the ANAO audit—another national investigation—but, importantly, the referral of allegations to ICAC, which is a body with the powers of a royal commission. So our federation, which works in almost every area you care to point out, will work in this area. We need to trust the stability of our federation to get this right in the interests of all the communities along the Murray-Darling Basin. <span style="font-style:italic;">(Time expired)</span></span>

                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Senator BERNARDI</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">South Australia</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">17:40</span>):  I come to this debate on the urgency motion from a rather unique position. I'm really not interested in the politics of what has gone on. I recognise and acknowledge that there are a great many people who have taken more serious and significant interest in the health and wellbeing of the Murray-Darling Basin system and the Barwon-Darling Basin system than I have over a great many years. They have been diligent and applied their skills and knowledge to getting favourable outcomes, and I thought we had that agreed. What concerns me about this is that there are allegations that have been aired on the ABC that demonstrate, indicate or suggest that activity that some would say is criminal and some would say is corrupt has taken place. These things have taken place by individuals who are linked to ministers or political parties. They extend into areas which call into question the reasonableness, the efficacy and the potential corruption of politics. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I just want some answers. To be honest, I've been around long enough not to trust governments to investigate themselves or their own. That's not to say that they can't do a good job of it, but I just am sceptical enough to recognise that cover-ups take place when people don't want to get to the truth. There is too much here. One of the benefits of having a relatively large nose is that you have a nose for BS. You can pick up the aroma of nonsense when people are telling it to you. Every single one of my antenna went up when I saw that. Since then I have spoken to people who are not South Australian but are deeply concerned about the health and viability of the Barwon-Darling river system, who are deeply concerned by what is happening in New South Wales and others who are concerned by what is happening further downstream. I just want to get to the truth.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Quite frankly, given the links of the New South Wales government and some representatives that have been involved in this, some representatives of the Murray-Darling Basin Commission, and given the links I asked about in question time today involving some in the National Party, I just think we need to make sure that there is an independent judicial inquiry—not to solve it all but to get the facts on the table and say: 'There is a significant problem here and we now need a more substantive inquiry. We need a royal commission'—or whatever it is—'further down the track.' That is my position. I do not care about the politics of this. I'm interested in getting an outcome to make sure that the river system is healthy, that it is serving New South Wales, Victoria and South Australia, and that people are doing what they are committed to do rather than covering it up.</span>

                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Senator McALLISTER</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">New South Wales</span>—<span class="HPS-MinisterialTitles">Deputy Opposition Whip in the Senate</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">17:43</span>):  The debate this afternoon on this urgency motion, quite naturally, has reflected the importance that South Australia places on the Murray-Darling Basin Plan. I've got to say that, as someone who cares about the basin, I'm incredibly grateful for the efforts of South Australians and the advocacy of South Australians over many years, because they have played a very important role in asserting over time a call for political reform. I want to focus my remarks today on the consequences for New South Wales and specifically for the Barwon-Darling area because I know this part of New South Wales. It is important in this debate to be thinking about the consequences of failing to deliver on the plan in this area, with all of its complexity and fragility.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The Barwon-Darling corridor has a system of rivers and lakes and wetlands and flood plains, and that provides habitat for more than 10,000 birds—and that includes the iconic brolgas. The river red gums that grow along the banks of the river system and the flood plains of this system stretch out with different kinds of eucalypts and their names resonate in the popular imagination when we think about western New South Wales and its environment: the poplar box, the iron wood, the mulga, the white cypress pine.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The system is actually like a big funnel and it channels the in-flows from the tributaries further north, like the Barwon, the Macintyre, the Weir and the Culgoa. These are systems that up until now have been reasonably unregulated. There aren't big dams on the rivers, and the rivers for the most part have an integrity in the way that their flows mirror the natural flows that characterise most Australian river systems in fairly dry areas. There is a remarkable Indigenous heritage—40,000-year-old fish traps at Brewarrina protected by the World Conservation Union.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The management of water in this area is absolutely critical to the health and resilience of all of those assets, all of that natural heritage. People like to talk about how much water flows down the river like it's a big pipe, but actually what matters in Australian river systems, which are highly variable, are the floods—those situations where a big pulse of water comes down the system, spreads out over the banks of the river and into the flood plains—and it is that flooding process that provides the habitat for bird breeding, for frogs, for lizards. That is the process that drives biodiversity in western New South Wales, and so when we are talking about corrupt practice, about water theft, about illegal activity, about the collusion between government officials and the industry they are supposed to regulate, about disrespect at best from a government minister for the fundamentals of the plan, we have a serious problem. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">It is not enough for governments to investigate themselves or for departments to investigate themselves. We need an investigation with substantial powers that can get to the bottom of this behaviour. A body like a judicial inquiry that can protect whistleblowers, that can compel people to give evidence and that can undertake the necessary investigations to understand what is going on and to protect the integrity of the Murray-Darling Basin Plan.</span>

                  <a href="266499" type="MemberSpeech">
                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Senator HUME</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Victoria</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">17:47</span>):  I also rise today to speak on this matter of urgency submitted by our parliamentary colleague from the Northern Territory, Senator McCarthy. Senator McCarthy would like this chamber to consider the need to establish an independent national judicial inquiry through the Council of Australian Governments following allegations of theft and corruption in the management of water resources in the Barwon-Darling Basin. While I applaud Senator McCarthy for bringing this matter to the attention of the chamber, the idea that a judicial inquiry is necessary to investigate and prosecute breaches of state law is entirely inappropriate.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The debate in this chamber is very, very important, and it gives me great pleasure to speak on this matter, as the proper and prudent management of precious water resources is not just a matter for South Australian senators, but it is also very dear to the hearts of my own constituents, particularly those in rural Victoria. And I agree wholeheartedly that the misuse and mismanagement of common water resources cannot be allowed to continue. That is why the Deputy Prime Minister, and Assistant Minister Ruston, have jointly announced that the Murray-Darling Basin Authority will conduct an independent basin-wide review into the compliance with state-based regulations governing water use.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">But, far more importantly, the state of New South Wales is taking great steps to respond to and investigate the allegations levelled in a recent <span style="font-style:italic;">Four Corners</span> report. The New South Wales government has launched an independent investigation into the allegations made on <span style="font-style:italic;">Four Corners</span>, led by Ken Matthews AO, a highly respected man of great integrity and, in addition to that, the matter has also been referred to the New South Wales Independent Commission Against Corruption, the ICAC. These state-level actions are entirely appropriate, given that the allegations raised in the <span style="font-style:italic;">Four Corners</span> report relate to breaches of New South Wales state law. Now, I'm not in a position to explain to Senator McCarthy the nature of the Australian Constitution, but I am indeed surprised that the Labor Party can't see this very clearly for the state matter that it is.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">There is no denying that issues of water theft and corruption in the management of the basin resources are extraordinarily serious, and, quite clearly, irrigators in every relevant state and basin communities must be able to have confidence that the rules that govern water use in the Murray-Darling Basin are being followed to the letter. It is for this reason that I am in fact encouraged by the dual actions taken by the New South Wales state government, and I commend the New South Wales state government for their expedient action on this matter.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Calls for a judicial review or a royal commission are quite another issue. Quite frankly, even though I have great respect for Senator McCarthy I am disappointed that she has reached back into that old Labor toolbox of calling for an expensive and unnecessary royal commission or judicial inquiry. A judicial review is an independent legal process that could take up to 12 months, cost millions of dollars and require the cooperation of the New South Wales government and potentially other basin states. It isn't necessary; it isn't expedient; it isn't constitutionally appropriate—and it is an unconscionable waste of taxpayer money.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Water is understandably an emotional issue for many Australians, not least of whom are the basin communities that owe so much of their prosperity to the shared water resources. Water theft is unconscionable. I thank Senator McCarthy for raising this important issue in the chamber, but we must resist the call from those opposite for a costly, unnecessary inquiry into this matter. <span style="font-style:italic;">(Time expired)</span></span>

                  </a>  I will continue to speak on the matter then. The Murray-Darling river passes through areas which receive little rain. In these dry areas water is gold, providing people with drinking water and water for agriculture. The recent allegations concerning the Barwon-Darling river are disturbing, but theft and corruption are not confined to this part of the Murray-Darling river system. We need a judicial inquiry into the Commonwealth purchase of water throughout the Murray-Darling Basin because we are paying for environmental water that is ending up in hands of large irrigators and others. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The Murray-Darling problem goes beyond private and government corruption. It involves the wastage of the $13 billion of taxpayer money committed to fixing the problems of the river system. We cannot replace Darling River flows by releasing water held in dams like Hume weir and sending it down the Murray. This strategy is flawed. The low banks of the Murray cannot contain excessive man-made water flows. The result is catastrophic floods, damaging the environment and farmers alike. The so-called facts on which the present Murray-Darling Basin Plan rests need to be revisited by an independent body, because the Murray-Darling Basin Authority does not engender any confidence.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I was informed—I did not hear the speech myself—that Senator Fawcett made the comment that I had no idea what I am talking about and that I haven't been there. Let me bring to the attention of the house that Senator Burston, Senator Roberts and I made an extensive three-day tour of the Murray-Darling river from Melbourne right to the mouth in South Australia. We talked to communities. We talked to the farmers who are going under and losing their businesses and who are destitute because they are not being listened to by politicians. How many members of this house have bothered to take the time to go and investigate this and speak to not only the farmers and the communities, but the businesses who will lose their livelihoods because this is not being sorted out?</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">Knowing this, from having acquainted myself with the situation in Victoria and South Australia, I also went to St George in Queensland. They are also affected by the regulations that have been brought in. At one stage the Murray-Darling was looked after by 35 people; now it is in excess of hundreds. Why do we need that many people? This whole thing has to be taken out of the hands of profiteers who are making money out of this. Let's utilise the water. It is like gold in this country. It needs to be managed correctly and in the best interests of Australians.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">
                  <a href="I0U" type="MemberSpeech">
                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Senator HANSON-YOUNG</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">South Australia</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">17:54</span>):  I rise today to speak in favour of a judicial inquiry into areas of the Murray-Darling Basin and the allegations of immense corruption, theft of water, dodgy election donations and cover-up after cover-up. We know that some of these allegations were aired on the <span style="font-style:italic;">Four Corners</span> program some weeks ago, but we know others are starting to seep out as well. And what did we hear from the New South Wales government and then followed up by our own water minister, Barnaby Joyce? First denial, dismissal that this was of any concern to anybody outside of New South Wales, and then ridicule for those of us who live further downstream. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I can tell you, Madam Acting Deputy President Reynolds, that in the week following the airing of those allegations on <span style="font-style:italic;">Four Corners</span>, I went down to the Lower Lakes in the Coorong in South Australia at the mouth of the Murray. I spoke to the local community there, and they are fed-up. They are fed-up with being treated as second-class citizens who live in the Murray-Darling Basin. For decades, they have fought to have a fair share of water. For decades, they have fought for the river to be given its required allowance so that it can continue to thrive, live and be a healthy, functioning river system. What they heard in that <span style="font-style:italic;">Four Corners</span> report, the subsequent comments from New South Wales ministers and then our own federal water minister was dismissal and a total lack of concern. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">This is grand theft—$13 billion of Australian taxpayer money being spent to buy water that is designed for the environment to keep the river alive so that everybody who lives throughout the basin has the opportunity for sustainable industry and to keep those communities that rely on the river going. The river needs enough water to survive, and we know at the bottom end of the river system—the Lower Lakes in the Coorong, where the community that I visited a couple of weeks ago live—that that section of the Murray-Darling Basin is the lungs of the river. If you don't have the lungs of the river working properly, if you don't get that flush of salt out to sea, if you don't have enough water at the bottom end, the river will die. Scientists have told us that over and over again and, at the height of the drought five years ago, we saw with our own eyes just how much devastation the theft of water upstream was causing the rest of the river system. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The attitude from our federal water minister Barnaby Joyce has undermined, significantly, the goodwill of all member states of the Murray-Darling Basin Plan and to ensure that we all work together for the health of the river. And we know what Minister Joyce's attitude really is towards the Murray-Darling Basin and for those of us who live downstream. All he needs is to get a few beers into him at the Shepparton pub and he starts telling anyone who will listen that he hates greenies, doesn't give two hoots about environmental flows, and thank goodness the Nationals are in control so that the big irrigators continue to suck out more water. A few beers and the minister is mouthing off about how much of a hero he is, covering up the corruption and water theft upstream in the Murray-Darling Basin. He is unfit to be the water minister. He has a conflict of interest and, if the federal government is serious about restoring trust in the Murray-Darling Basin and how it should be managed, they must deal with the biggest and the weakest link—and that is Minister Joyce. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">There is no way Minister Joyce should be in charge of the nation's iconic river system. He doesn't care about environmental flows. He doesn't care about anyone who lives downstream; all he cares about is the election donations coming from those big corporate irrigators.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Small">This report also concludes the committee's examination of the Australian Public Service Commissioner's Directions 2016. The committee's examination of these directions is testament to the constructive role that the committee is playing in identifying particular technical human rights issues and engaging in constructive dialogue. The committee previously raised concerns about the compatibility of the directions with the right to privacy and wrote to the Australian Public Service Commissioner about this issue. The Commissioner's response noted that the committee's report had raised valid questions about whether the limitation on the right to privacy imposed by the directions was a proportionate measure for upholding integrity in the Australian Public Service and undertook to conduct a review into these matters. The Commissioner has now informed the committee that, following that review, new arrangements will be adopted that address the compatibility of the directions with the right to privacy. Such action is to be applauded.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Small">Implemented on 1 January 2016, the AIR Act improved the arrangements surrounding the medical exemption process such that only general practitioners could assess for medical exemptions. </span>

                  <span class="HPS-Small">Since the introduction of the AIR Act, immunisation clinicians have requested that other specialised medical professionals have their assessments for medical exemptions recognised by the AIR, in addition to general practitioners. These included paediatricians, public health physicians, infectious diseases physicians and clinical immunologists.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Small">This legislation enables these highly qualified specialists, who are often best placed to assess children for immunisation, the opportunity to provide comprehensive care for their patients. </span>

                  <span class="HPS-Small">Allowing these specialists to notify medical exemption to the Australian Immunisation Register will maintain the integrity of the No Jab, No Pay policy because it ensures that the most qualified clinicians are able to make this assessment.</span>

                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">Based on this feedback, the Bill will make minor amendments to paragraph 9(c) and subparagraph 9(d) (iii) of the AIR Act to allow paediatricians, public health physicians, infectious diseases physicians and clinical immunologists to assess that a young individual should not have a vaccine for medical reasons or natural immunity to a disease. </span>

                  <span class="HPS-Small">Schedule 2 of the Bill includes provisions to amend the FA Act for consistency. The amendments will expand the medical practitioners who can certify medical exemptions in line with the amendments to the AIR Act.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Small">The Bill also makes a minor amendment to paragraph 9(b) of the AIR Act to make it explicit that the AIR can only accept vaccination information provided by recognised vaccination providers, and not members of the public. This removes any uncertainty associated with who can provide vaccination information.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Small">Through the Bill, the AIR will continue to operate to support the continued efforts of health professionals to improve the health of individuals.

                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">The Customs Tariff Amendment (Incorporation of Proposal and Other Measures) Bill 2017 contains a number of amendments to the <span style="font-style:italic;">Customs Tariff Act 1995. </span>These amendments will assist Australian business and consumers and will further enhance the operation of certain aspects of the Act.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">Firstly, the Bill will incorporate Customs Tariff Proposal (No. 1) 2017 into the Act, ensuring that the correct customs duty rate of 'Free' is legislated for tariff subheading 6907.30.10, which applies to certain mosaic tiles. This amendment will ensure that Australian businesses have certainty about customs duty rates applied to these goods.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">Secondly, the Bill will extend the concessional arrangements for imports of automotive prototypes and components. Currently, the concession provided for by Item 39 in Schedule 4 of the Act is only available to motor vehicle manufactures. The amendments contained in this Bill will extend these arrangements to include automotive service providers to support research and development by the automotive industry.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">Thirdly, the Bill will remove the $12,000 special customs duty on used and second-hand motor vehicles. The special duty is rarely applied as importers are able to seek an exemption under Item 37 in Schedule 4 of the Act. This amendment will remove some of the red tape that consumers face when importing a used or second-hand motor vehicle from 1 January 2018.</span>
                </p>

                  <span class="HPS-Small">Finally, the Bill will make a number of amendments to improve the usability of the Act.

                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">Many students in the higher education sector are not currently afforded the same protection from exploitation by providers, and higher education providers seeking to enter the sector are not subject to the same scrutiny as those in the VET sector. There is also opportunity in the international education sector to build on Australia's rigorous quality controls by delivering greater scrutiny of providers seeking registration to deliver education to international students.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Small">The Turnbull Government has decided to act now and apply similar measures in the higher and international education sectors to those recently enacted for VET to identify, monitor and prevent the sorts of unscrupulous behaviours by some VET FEE-HELP providers from tarnishing the reputation of Australia's international education and higher education sectors. </span>
                </p>

                  <span class="HPS-Small">And of course, for the majority of providers who operate with integrity and in the best interest of their students, these measures will require little change.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Small">This Bill enables the Minister to make a legislative instrument setting out any additional matters for regulators to consider when assessing whether a provider is fit and proper to be registered to educate international students. This will allow the Minister to adjust fit and proper requirements as needed, in response to emerging issues in the sector. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">This provision will ensure the ESOS regulators are aware of the history of providers or individuals who have had action taken against them due to their unscrupulous behaviour, and who are now seeking registration in the international education sector. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">For providers who are already registered, new provisions in the Bill expand existing requirements that they notify the regulator of significant changes to their management or business practices. Providers must also notify the regulator where they become aware key personnel have any serious recent past convictions, or have had regulatory action taken against their previous approval to deliver Government programs.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">These provisions ensure individuals previously involved in dubious business practices will not go undetected if they move into influential positions within international education.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Small">To expand the ability of the Government to respond to emerging trends which indicate a potential risk to the integrity of the international education sector, this Bill includes provisions that enhance the information sharing abilities of Government agencies. </span>

                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">An enhanced ability to share information among enforcement agencies is a sensible, pragmatic action which will enable the Government to monitor providers more effectively and proactively address identified concerns.</span>

                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">Requiring providers to assess a student as academically suitable and limiting eligibility for FEE-HELP loans to those students who are genuinely studying will prevent vulnerable people from being signed up for courses they are not capable of completing, and incurring debts they may not be in a position to repay. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">In order to maintain eligibility for FEE-HELP at these higher education providers, students must also achieve and maintain a reasonable level of completion of units undertaken. The onus should be on both the provider and the student to achieve this – the provider to have high quality teaching and student support in place, and the student to engage with the course requirements. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">An important aspect of these changes is that they ensure non-genuine students, or those who were not eligible to incur the debt for academic reasons, are able to have their debts remitted. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">The Bill also triggers powers under the <span style="font-style:italic;">Regulatory Powers (Standard Provisions) Act 2014</span>. This allows the department to monitor and investigate, and to apply enforcement provisions such as civil penalties, again mirroring arrangements for VET Student Loans. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">This Schedule also introduces measures to allow the Commonwealth to cap the amount of FEE-HELP assistance a provider is able to offer, or restrict student numbers or courses for which they are able to offer FEE‑HELP. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">These measures will prevent artificial growth due to non-genuine student enrolments, and allow the Commonwealth to act quickly if there is evidence that a provider is dishonestly trying to take advantage of the system. </span>

                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">Conclusion</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">Together, these vital measures represent an important insurance – and quality assurance – policy for our higher education and international education sectors, and are consistent with changes recently enacted in the VET sector. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">The Bill ensures that as we increase learning opportunities for overseas students and market opportunities for dedicated education providers, we also shut down opportunities for unscrupulous providers to harm the reputation of our education services.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">By enhancing the protections in place for students, and strengthening the monitoring framework for international education providers and non‑university higher education providers, we are avoiding another disaster like the failed VET FEE-HELP scheme, and ensuring that both the higher education and international education sectors maintain the highest standards of quality and integrity, for which we are internationally renowned. </span>

                  <span class="HPS-Small">I would like to thank Senators for their contribution to this debate on the Prime Minister and Cabinet Legislation Amendment (2017 Measures No.1) Bill 2017 (bill). The bill amends legislation and repeals redundant legislation. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">I present for the information of Senators an addendum to the Explanatory Memorandum which responds to a request made by the Senate Standing Committee for the Scrutiny of Bills<span style="font-style:italic;">. </span>The Committee requested that key additional information provided to that Committee be included in the Explanatory Memorandum. [Present Addendum]</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">The amendments to the <span style="font-style:italic;">Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Commission Amendment Act 2005</span> enable the Commonwealth and its portfolio bodies to waive the exercise of its statutory consent power over certain Commonwealth funded assets by providing written notice to the Indigenous organisation concerned that consent to dispose of an interest in land is no longer required. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">Historical Indigenous grant funding of land or property has been secured through the Commonwealth's application of ongoing rights and interests, usually notified by a caveat. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">In 2015, the Council of Australian Governments recommended that the Commonwealth review remaining caveats on Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Commission properties and remove unnecessary restrictions to support economic development for Indigenous land owners.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">At the moment, the law does not allow the Commonwealth to waive rights and interests for an organisation unless the contractual link is broken by the sale or disposal of the property. This ongoing aspect of rights and interests is not in line with other Commonwealth grant funding processes. In addition, the current policy is to maintain the Commonwealth's interests through the use of contract law after a property sale has occurred. The changes will reduce administrative burden and regulatory requirements for organisations and government.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">The bill will also support this Government's approach to work in partnership with Indigenous Australians, empower local communities and promote economic opportunities. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">The Commonwealth and its portfolio bodies can elect to notify the Indigenous organisations that consent is no longer required to dispose of an interest in land. The consenting authorities in question include the Department of the Prime Minister and Cabinet, Indigenous Business Australia, the Indigenous Land Corporation and other bodies with responsibilities for Indigenous Affairs, such as the Department of Health and the Attorney-General's Department.  These amendments will reduce red tape for the Commonwealth by permitting it to remove its regulatory role in the disposal of land and provide opportunities to further the social, economic or cultural development of Aboriginal persons and Torres Strait Islanders in the management of land.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">

                </p>

                  <span class="HPS-Small">The bill repeals the <span style="font-style:italic;">Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islanders (Queensland Reserves and Communities Self-management) Act 1978</span> and <span style="font-style:italic;">Council for Aboriginal Reconciliation Act 1991</span>. These two acts are both redundant as the Commonwealth can no longer declare Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander reserves in Queensland, and the Council for Aboriginal Reconciliation is no longer in use.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">The bill amends the <span style="font-style:italic;">Auditor-General Act 1997</span> to align annual reporting requirements of the Auditor-General with his or her responsibility to the Parliament. The Auditor-General is an independent officer of the Parliament. The reintroduction of tabling of annual reports directly to the Parliament would demonstrate the independence of the office and be consistent with its responsibilities to the Parliament. It would also bring Australia in line with international best practice for comparable auditing institutions. The amendment would allow for the Auditor-General to table the 2016-17 annual report directly to Parliament. </span>

                  <span class="HPS-Small">Finally, the bill amends the <span style="font-style:italic;">Royal Commissions</span><span style="font-style:italic;">Act</span><span style="font-style:italic;"> 1902</span> to give Commissioners a new power and to increase some offence penalties. These changes will assist the operation of future Royal Commissions. Another change will give administrative flexibility by enabling records of a completed Royal Commission to be held by the Attorney-General's Department when that is considered the appropriate agency. </span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This morning we heard Minister Cash, in one of her diatribes, say that workplaces should be cooperative, productive and fair. Let me tell you that the building and construction code does not lead to cooperative workplaces. It does not lead to productive workplaces and it does not lead to fair workplaces. I notice that the minister never mentioned having safe workplaces, but let me add that to the list that Minister Cash outlined. Let me indicate that the Australian Building and Construction Commission does nothing for safety in relation to building and construction workers in this country.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Minister Cash also said this morning that small and medium workplaces need to be able to compete. Really, that is code—not the Building Code—but it's a code for letting the cowboys loose in the building and construction industry. The cowboys are in there, with no concern for health and safety. And what we see is what happened to two young Irish backpackers in East Perth, who were employed by Jackson Construction. They were Gerry Bradley and Joe McDermott, young Irish construction workers killed on the job, even after the CFMEU had notified WorkSafe in Western Australia that there was a problem and after they had tried to enter the Jackson site to deal with health and safety issues. And what happened to them? They were obstructed by the ABCC. You let cowboy companies on the job, and what do you get? You get young workers killed. You get a 27-year-old German backpacker working 13 floors up, falling to her death. That's the type of situation you get when you have the ABCC and this Building Code in place.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We need to get back to a situation in the industry where the tripartite groups—the government, the building unions and the employers in the industry—can come together and sit down to discuss the issues that will improve productivity and that will improve health and safety on the site, not this ideological nonsense that Minister Cash proposes every time she's on her feet, which is about diminishing workers' rights in the building and construction industry and diminishing health and safety. It's an ideology which has no concern for proper training and skills in the industry, letting exploitation take its way in the industry—where the small businesses and big businesses can exploit workers without any fear of any government regulation or government legislation that will deal with it.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We see overseas labour flooding into these building and construction sites, many of them young backpackers with no experience in the industry, being killed and being maimed in the building and construction industry—a very dangerous industry. We see apprentices being exploited in the industry. Does the Building Code fix that? No, it doesn't. Does the ABCC deal with that? No, they don't. This is just an ideological group set up by this government to diminish workers' rights and access to the unions in the industry. It's about allowing a dog-eat-dog undercutting of the rates of pay properly negotiated by the unions and the building industry by providing protections for these fly-by-nighters, the cowboys in the industry, coming in to undercut decent wages in the industry. It's one of the reasons we have wage stagnation in this country. It's one of the reasons the Reserve Bank Governor has come out and said, 'Make more demands for wages,' because wages under this minister are stagnating. Profitability is going up and wages are going down, and that's because of these ideologically driven pieces of legislation that provide for the ABCC and the Building Code.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I have to say to you—and I've said this on many occasions—I have never seen a more incompetent servant of the Australian public than Nigel Hadgkiss, the building commissioner, who established their approach under the direction of the former minister, Senator Eric Abetz, and continued on with the ideology that drives Senator Cash to attack working people and their unions, to determine that the core business of the ABCC will not allow them to deal with workers' exploitation. They won't deal with phoenixing and sham contracting. They won't deal with health and safety. And it was only after legislation to re-establish the ABCC came to this Senate—last year, I think, now—that we actually got changes to the legislation to try to widen the issues that the ABCC dealt with. I know Senator Xenophon made comments about the conduct of Mr Nigel Hadgkiss, the commissioner for the ABCC, who has responsibility to oversight this code—a code that is simply about diminishing workers' rights in the building and construction industry. And Senator Xenophon agreed with me that there were significant problems with the operation of the ABCC. How such an incompetent, ideologically driven public servant could ever be given the responsibility to implement legislation in the building and construction industry beggars belief. I just don't understand it. He is absolutely incompetent and absolutely ideologically driven.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Let's look at what this minister has delivered with this code. This is a code that is supposedly improving productivity but, when you look at it, it's only about driving down wages and conditions and trying to ensure that the building and construction unions have little opportunity to increase rights in the building industry.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">One of the clauses in that building code stops unions negotiating with companies to increase the opportunities for young Australians getting apprenticeships in the industry. I was a union official for 27 years, and one of my jobs whenever I was bargaining was to get young kids a job—give young kids an opportunity to get an apprenticeship. But that is directly illegal under this building code. That's despite the ABS estimating that, in 2015, approximately 27,400 young people applied for apprenticeships in the industry, but were unsuccessful in obtaining one. This is something that has been allowed for decades in this country, because this government determines that you are not going to be allowed to bargain with your employer to increase apprenticeships. What a nonsense!</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The other aspect of this building code is about increasing casualisation. That's what it's about. It's about stopping workers getting permanent jobs in the industry. Clauses requiring casual conversion to permanent work after six weeks is not code compliant. I don't know anywhere in this country, never mind overseas, where you can't bargain for those issues. I don't know anywhere else in the world, in advanced economies, where unions can't bargain on behalf of the workers to get a conversion to permanent work after six weeks. This government—the ideologues and rabble of a government that they are—and this minister have determined that this doesn't fit with their view of the world and it doesn't fit with the employers who pour money into their election campaigns every year. That's despite that one in four workers in the industry are casual—23.9 per cent casual. That is significantly higher than the national average across all industries.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This code makes vulnerable temporary overseas workers even more vulnerable. Clauses and agreements which require the parties to confer to ensure that all parties are satisfied—that all laws in relation to sponsorship, engagement and employment of a person who is not an Australian citizen are complied with—are banned by the code. The unions—the workers on the job—cannot get a clause in an agreement that says, 'Migrant workers or workers who are coming here on a temporary basis are employed under Australian law.' This is despite the fact that, while there are approximately two million temporary workers in Australia—including over 1.4 million with work rights—the overseas workers team at the Fair Work Ombudsman consists of 17 full-time inspectors to investigate cases of exploitation. That's 80,000 visa holders per inspector. But does this code contemplate any of those issues? Does this code assist working people and ensure that foreign workers are coming in on the correct basis? It doesn't.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The code also bans clauses in enterprise agreements which ensure Australian residents will have preference in recruitment, employment and training opportunities relative to temporary foreign workers. What could be more crazy than that? This is a government who wants to reduce wages and conditions in the building and construction industry through this code and make it easy for companies to bring in temporary foreign workers at the expense of jobs for Australian workers. It makes it illegal to consult with the workers' union prior to the initial mobilisation of foreign labour. It makes it illegal for a union and workers on the job to ensure that, in the event of redundancies, temporary foreign workers will be made redundant first, given that temporary foreign workers are intended to supplement the Australian workforce. So this is what is in this code. It's not about productivity. It's not about ensuring that workers get rights. We so often hear from Senator Cash that the coalition are somehow standing up for workers' rights. I just can't stop laughing when I hear that from this rabble of a disjointed, divided government in here. They almost sound like Senator Roberts—completely out of touch with reality.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The last point: although confirmed as non-compliant with the ABCC guidance note, it is in direct contradiction to the promise that the minister made in the debate on the building and construction amendment bill on 14 February. So this is a minister that can't even keep her word. Her ideology just dominates her capacity to keep her word. And they have even banned a union flying charity flags from cranes. The code doesn't allow the flying of union flags or the Good Friday Appeal flag. The Turnbull government's building code has been used on Victoria's sky rail and Tullamarine upgrade to block efforts by the CFMEU to raise money for the Royal Children's Hospital Good Friday Appeal. We hear so much from this minister, this ideologue across the chamber, coming after unions for stopping the job at a children's hospital because workers were dying on the job. But when workers were raising $800,000 last year for charity, this code stopped them raising that money. It's just crazy!</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">They even got to the stage where they cancelled Christmas in the building and construction industry. Clauses which provide that in the construction sector Christmas shutdowns shall be observed as per the industry calendar are non-compliant. It is something that's happened in the building and construction industry for decades. But it doesn't fit with the ideology or the cost cutting that business want in that industry. There's no say for unions in fatigue management. Clauses in enterprise agreements that require union consultation for overtime in excess of 58 hours a week to be worked are banned. No wonder workers are getting killed in the building and construction industry directly because of this code. There is more fatigue and more pushing for long hours in a very dangerous industry. You can't deal with it in your agreement between you and the employer.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The code says that any disputed or delayed payment has to be reported to the ABC commissioner and the relevant funding entity. The ABCC has defined a payment has 'disputed' when it's referred to adjudication, and it's delayed when the amount payable is in accordance with a determination of an adjudicator. This doesn't help contractors and their reluctance to report that they're not being paid in the first place. This is an abomination of a code. It inhibits union officials' access to their workplace. The bulk of the disputes in the building and construction industry are when union officials are trying to get onto the site to protect their members' wages and conditions, protect their health and safety, and deal with workers who are being maimed and killed in the building and construction industry. Twenty-five have been killed in recent times. It's absolutely unacceptable. This Senate should not allow this code to continue.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Senator Xenophon needs to address these issues and why workers in this country are being denied the rights that are allowed in every other advanced country in the world. It provides a fig leaf to legitimate problems in the industry by paying lip-service to being concerned about health and safety, wage theft, worker exploitation, contractor underpayments, the exploitation of foreign labour and non-conforming building products that are killing people all over the world.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">John Holland have seven convictions for serious breaches of the Commonwealth Occupational Health and Safety Act—four of those involving fatalities—but they haven't been banned from construction building work. So you can kill workers on a building site but you can't fly a union flag. How ridiculous is that? How much more does this mob need to do to demonstrate how stupid they are in relation to this building code? Only two companies have lost accreditation for work on Commonwealth safety provided by the Federal Safety Commission in the 12 years that this has been established. But there has been fatality after fatality. There have been 424 fatalities in the construction industry in the last 12 years, as of 2 August. But do you hear any concerns about that from this rabble of a government? No; it's about stopping workers accessing a decent union and stopping them accessing decent rights. <span style="font-style:italic;">(Time expired)</span></span>

                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">
                    <a href="8IV" type="MemberSpeech">
                      <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Senator XENOPHON</span>
                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">South Australia</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">18:32</span>):  On behalf of my colleagues, we cannot support this disallowance motion. There has been no shortage of debate on the ABCC legislation and the building code that goes with it. Last November, I moved a series of amendments to that legislation, which were about making the bill fairer, making it more effective in terms of job creation and improving productivity in this country. The amendments included an important right to judicial review of decisions made by the ABCC, which had never existed before.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">As a general principle, I understand fully the argument that one industry should not be singled out for different treatment, but the industrial relations framework in the building and construction industry has a long, complex and vexed history. There was the Winneke royal commission in 1982, the Gyles royal commission in 1992, the Cole royal commission in 2003 and, most recently, the Heydon royal commission in 2015. There was also the Wilcox report, which was an initiative of the then federal Labor government in 2008. The final report was handed to the then Deputy Prime Minister, the Hon. Julia Gillard, in April 2009 in relation to the operations of the office of the Fair Work building and construction inspectorate. Justice Wilcox found that there was still a significant level of industrial unlawfulness in the building and construction industry. He was critical not just of unions but also of employers.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The more recent inquiry of former High Court justice Dyson Heydon gathered a great deal of evidence, some of which I found quite compelling, about serious issues—allegations of corruption, bullying and harassment. In his interim report, Commissioner Heydon found that some CFMEU members had acted in wilful defiance of the law, and there were allegations of corruption, death threats, extortion, gross neglect and other serious criminal matters. In his final report released in December 2015 the royal commissioner confirmed his findings that corruption was widespread and deep-seated. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The union officials allegedly involved ranged in seniority from the most junior to the most senior, although I hasten to add that Michael O'Connor, the national secretary of the CFMEU, and Dave Noonan, another very senior officer, have not been tainted by any of these allegations in the royal commission. Despite the fundamental differences that I have with Michael O'Connor over the building code, it was grossly unfair that he was wrongly reported for breaches of the act—that is, that he was named for allegedly being at an unlawful picket when he was in fact in another state. The leaking of that information, dragging his name into the parliament, was wrong. It was a disgrace.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The issue before us is whether the building code should be disallowed and in particular section 11 of the code. Perhaps the key issue relates to section 11 of the building code. This section prohibits code covered entities from being covered by an enterprise agreement in respect of building work which includes certain clauses, or from engaging in certain conduct. This section is the centrepiece of the building code. Its aim, as essentially stated, is to change the culture in the building and construction industry. The long history of royal commissions, together with the Wilcox report, notes that there is an issue with the culture in the building and construction industry. It is a difficult issue because the argument of those opposed to the building code is that it ought to be within the framework of the Fair Work Act and not derogate from that framework. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">That to me seems to be the key debate and the key ideological debate in respect of this. Those in favour of it say that if cultural change is needed then the building code will be the most effective tool, and it is needed because the courts have said this about the conduct on building sites. Justice White said in April last year in a case involving the CFMEU:</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">On any reasonable measure, that is an appalling record. It bespeaks an attitude by the CFMEU of ignoring, if not defying, the law and a willingness to contravene it as and when it chooses.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Last year as well Justice Jessup said:</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">The CFMEU's record of non-compliance with legislation of this kind has now become notorious. That record ought to be an embarrassment to the trade union movement. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Justice Mortimer in a 2016 case said:</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">The conduct has in common features of abuse of industrial power and the use of whatever means the individuals involved considered likely to achieve outcomes to the interests of the CFMEU.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">The conduct occurs so regularly, in situations with the same kinds of features, that the only available inference is that there is a conscious and deliberate strategy employed by the CFMEU and its officers to engage in disruptive threatening and abusive behaviour towards employers without regard to the lawfulness of that action, and impervious to the prospect of prosecution and penalties. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">It is for this reason, because of these exceptional circumstances, that the provisions of the building code are necessary at this time. If the behaviour changes, I would support the code changing. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Unlike some of my crossbench colleagues, I have continued to engage with the CFMEU in recent weeks. I did so in good faith. I spent a lot of time with them. Even though the CFMEU has previously unleashed a massive advertising campaign against me, featuring gross misrepresentations, outright lies and a post-truth campaign par excellence—the billboards and the full-page ads said that I didn't care about safety or about jobs—I have continued to talk to them. I've been told that after today in effect Armageddon will be unleashed against me and that there will be a massive campaign, the likes of which I have never seen. This fear-and-smear campaign on anything other than the code, as I understand it, is designed to damage and destroy, based on lies, distortions and misrepresentations, but I suggest it is counterproductive.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I want the best outcome for Australian workers on building sites. If Commonwealth money is involved on these sites, then it is reasonable to expect a reasonable standard of behaviour. I say to Senator Cameron, who I respect and admire for his passion on this and many other issues: the Senate estimates process is one of many processes to examine the conduct of the ABCC. If Senator Cameron has further evidence of what he considers to be unfair conduct and that requires a separate parliamentary inquiry, then the general principle is I will support that. But right now we have a situation as to whether the code should stand. The conduct and the behaviour has not changed; therefore, the building code should not change. I do not support this disallowance motion.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">
                    <span class="HPS-OfficeInterjecting">The PRESIDENT:</span>  The question is that the motion moved by Senator Cameron be agreed to.</span>

                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">New South Wales</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">18:47</span>):  As I understand, we are dealing with the One Nation amendments, and I use the word 'amendments' loosely. I did say in my earlier contribution today that One Nation have never stood up for workers in this place unless they've actually been embarrassed into standing up for workers and when they were forced to do that in relation to penalty rates. But here they are. They're not even satisfied with the attacks on working people brought about by Senator Cash and the coalition of hopeless people sitting across this chamber. They're not even satisfied with that. They want to go even further, and there was no capacity. Senator Roberts did not have a clue as to what the amendments would actually do. He did not have a clue what the implications were. Maybe his mind's on other things, like High Court challenges and the like. This is something that we see from One Nation whenever they get a chance to attack working people in this place. They set about attacking them, and that's exactly what these amendments do. We don't support the amendments. The government should not support the amendments. The government have done enough attacking on working people, without picking up your further attacks on working people.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">One Nation are an absolute disgrace. One Nation, you should not hold your heads up anywhere in this country, because workers' wages will diminish under you lot. You are simply subservient to the coalition. You do everything the coalition want you to do. You're worse than the National Party in that context, and that's saying a lot. So you should pull this off, because you don't even know what it means. You don't know what the implications are. You are an absolute disgrace. You should spend some productive time trying to build your case for the High Court. I think that's where you should put all of your efforts in. As I read it, you are in big trouble. Workers in this country will survive you, Senator Roberts. They will survive the coalition—</span>

Let me answer Senator Cameron's questions from earlier. 'Reasonable'—it's an adjective—means agreeable to reason or sound judgement; logical. Secondly, it means, not exceeding the limit prescribed by reason; not excessive. Thirdly, it means moderate, especially in price. And this is where it comes back to Senator Cameron's question wondering what it means with regard to union membership dues. So not expensive. Fourthly, it means, endowed with reason. Fifthly, it means capable of rational behaviour and rational decisions.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">So here's what it means: there would be some set of dues for everyday union members—the people that the union bosses are quite often stealing from. Then, to get around these corrupt payments, it would simply be a matter of creating an executive membership grade, which could be, for example, $10,000. And that would be the way companies would be paying off the union. Or it could be $100,000. Or it could be, as we have seen in the examples that I read yesterday and today, $1 million. Is that a reasonable membership due? I say not. Maybe the senator was sleeping through my speech yesterday. So I will read what I said when I described this.

This bill is about protecting union members from the sorts of corrupt payments that they have stolen from union members through the union bosses. The union bosses have stolen from the union members. That's what we need to protect. The employers are in cahoots with some union bosses to steal from union members and deny them their rights. This is about restoring workers' rights and union members' rights. And that is reasonable.</span>

I don't think that when Senator Cameron was secretary of the AMWU the fee was $10,000 or anything like it. Any union that tried to charge an unreasonable fee would find itself in a position where they wouldn't have too many members. They would have a situation where people would join another registered organisation in its place.</span>

It's in no way an improvement. It's just out there doing more work for the coalition in a very ugly way and that would bring further hardship. It speaks volumes about what type of party One Nation is. Just because we're hearing from the likes of the minister of how they're doing it for the workers—and now we're hearing it from One Nation—doesn't mean that what people say is true. It's certainly not true because workers need unions. Workers need unions that are out there representing them, campaigning for them and getting better conditions. That's why we all can enjoy lunch breaks, holidays and superannuation—because people came together and they struggled. Yes, mistakes were made along the way, but we already have sufficient laws to tackle that. What One Nation is after is very punitive, very dangerous and should be defeated.</span>

My point is that, to get around the membership dues being reasonable, unions can take payments off companies and call them membership dues. That's what I was referring to, and that's what this amendment is designed to stop. </span>

Would it mean if a union collectively bargained for workers in one sector of the union that the other workers who have paid their member dues will not directly benefit, therefore it's unlawful? It is completely and utterly unworkable and unreasonable, and we do not support it.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The AiG, the ACTU, Professor Andrew Stewart and many other stakeholders have raised concerns that the exemptions in the bill to the cash or in-kind benefit offence are too narrowly drawn. For example, it makes it an offence for the following activities, which are not corrupt or corrupting and are standard activities: unions requesting and receiving payment from employers of wages or entitlements owed to ex-employees; unions negotiating the settlement of disputes with employers before court proceedings are commenced or have failed; and standard travel and hospitality during negotiations—for example, the employer making their conference room available with morning tea for a negotiation. The Labor amendments will mean that these perfectly proper activities are within the statutory exemptions.</span>

This would mean that anyone who was once employed by an employer would then be free to receive any payment from that employer, even if the payment has no relevance to their former employment and they are working for the union. One such example of an arrangement was uncovered by the royal commission. In this case, a worker resigned from Huntsman Corporation to take up a job as an AWU organiser in a deal engineered by none other than the Leader of the Opposition. Mr Bugg was paid by the company as an organiser, but large parts of the payments, ostensibly for his wages, were channelled into the AWU's general revenue. We cannot support these types of arrangements being hidden from workers, and so we do not support Labor's amendments.</span>

                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">In relation to the payments for nominal value, without the government's amendment, Labor's proposed amendment would provide no cap on the size of the payments that can be transferred between union officials and employers. Again, it creates a massive loophole. It's not at all clear what would constitute a nominal payment in the context of travel or hospitality, which are generally costly gifts. Would a nominal gift of travel include an employer lending a private jet to a union secretary to take private holidays in Cuba? Unfortunately, that's not far-fetched, because that is exactly what happened in terms of the Leader of the Opposition while he was a union boss negotiating an enterprise agreement.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Any travel or related costs that are genuinely associated with bargaining or other roles of registered organisations will not be affected by the bill. What our amendment seeks to do is to ensure that the term 'nominal payments' actually does refer to small amounts, and we are proposing that gifts of up to two penalty units—$420—would be nominal gifts. We would seek the support of the chamber to clarify those two amendments put by Labor.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Senator CAROL BROWN</span>
                </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Tasmania</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">19:21</span>):  I rise to speak on the Australian Human Rights Commission <span style="font-style:italic;">Change the c</span><span style="font-style:italic;">ourse</span> on sexual assault and sexual harassment at Australian universities. This landmark report and nationwide survey found that more than half of university students were sexually harassed last year. Every young person has the right to further their education and every student has the right to access that education free from the threat or fear of sexual violence.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Normal">As my colleagues, the Shadow Minister for Education and Women, Tanya Plibersek, and the Shadow Assistant Minister for Universities, Terri Butler, said, this report contains disturbing findings and demands urgent action. The survey was the first of its kind and the first look at in detail the extent and nature of this problem in Australia. As well as the national survey, the commission also accepted written submissions and it is telling that nearly 2,000 submissions were received. We should be very clear about this report. Sexual violence is a crime and should be reported to police. And sexual harassment is never okay.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Normal">Last year the University of Tasmania partnered with 38 other Australian universities to conduct the national survey of student experiences of sexual assault, threats and harassment. It was a vital step to understanding the welfare and safety of students, including international students, LBGTI students and students with a disability. The survey was funded by Universities Australia, with seed funding provided by The Hunting Ground Australia Project.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Normal">The results of the <span style="font-style:italic;">Change the c</span><span style="font-style:italic;">ourse</span> based on the national survey were staggering. One in every two students surveyed were sexually harassed on at least one occasion in 2016, and 6.9 per cent of students surveyed were sexually assaulted on at least one occasion in 2015 or 2016. And most sexual harassment occurred on public transport either to or from university campus. It was particularly troubling that the report found women were twice as likely to be the victim of sexual violence, and trans and gender diverse students were at greater risk of sexual harassment.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Normal">These statistics are concerning as they are, but they do not include the dark figure of sex crimes. The dark figure represents the unknown number of sexual assaults that are not registered in the statistics due to the prevalence of underreporting. We know that few of these crimes are reported and even fewer proceed through the criminal justice system. The report identified four key contributing factors common to many Australian universities: underlying attitudes towards women, alcohol consumption on campus, university staff abusing their power over students and the culture of on-campus residential settings, where there is easy access to bedrooms and places to commit sexual assault and sexual harassment.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Normal">The commission made nine recommendations. These included: ensuring each university vice-chancellor has carriage of implementing campus reforms; developing and delivering a plan to address the drivers of sexual violence, tailored for staff and students; raising awareness about support services available to students by making information accessible and developing relationships with external community services; recommending that each university commission a review into their existing policies for responding to sexual assault and sexual harassment, with particular consideration given to how each university can accommodate the needs of students from diverse backgrounds; ensuring staff receive adequate training in responding to student complaints and disclosures; and conducting an audit of university counselling services within six months. </span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Normal">When the report was launched, the Sex Discrimination Commissioner, Kate Jenkins, said the results of the survey and the reports were confronting. She said:</span>

              <span class="HPS-Small">We received numerous accounts of women being sexually assaulted by people they described as 'close friends', who they trusted.</span>

              <span class="HPS-Small">Sadly, the impacts of these experiences can be life changing: affecting health, studies and future careers.</span>

              <span class="HPS-Normal">Ms Jenkins believes that university staff must do more. She said:</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
              <span class="HPS-Small">The Commission heard about the barriers people face to reporting sexual assault and sexual harassment. One of the most common reasons for not reporting was that people did not know where or who to report to.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
              <span class="HPS-Small">It is clear that universities must do more to publicise their reporting processes.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
              <span class="HPS-Normal">The vice-chancellor of the Australian National University, Professor Brian Schmidt, has been outspoken on these issues since he was appointed in 2016. Professor Schmidt said:</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
              <span class="HPS-Small">The survey results are really utterly shocking. They show that we have a problem here across our sector, that people are being sexually harassed and sexually assaulted at a rate that I think people are going to find hard to accept.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">

              <span class="HPS-Small">I believe everyone should be safe from inter-personal violence, sexual harassment and assault. </span>

              <span class="HPS-Small">I believe harassment and assault are the fault of the person using violence, not the person subjected to the violence.</span>

              <span class="HPS-Normal">The findings of the survey were not surprising to Freya Willis, an ANU law student who was raped by a fellow university student at a club and societies event. Freya knows that more needs to be done to ensure change occurs:</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
              <span class="HPS-Small">These results are really confirmation of what students and activists have been talking about for years, but I guess, it's useful for us to have this on paper finally.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
              <span class="HPS-Normal">Sexual violence has no place in our society. The report shows that in my home state of Tasmania students are being sexually harassed above the national rate. Ninety-two per cent of Tasmanian students surveyed reported not seeking support or assistance from the University of Tasmania after they were sexually harassed. Sixty per cent of Tasmanian students admitted they either had no knowledge or very little knowledge of where to go within the university to make a complaint about sexual harassment.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Normal">I was pleased last Thursday to join my colleague the federal member for Franklin, Julie Collins MP, and the women's collective at the University of Tasmania to launch a petition calling on the university to respond to sexual violence and harassment on campus. The petition, which forms part of the national campaign headed by Young Labor, calls for a standard framework for reporting incidents. The petition also calls for an on-campus counselling service which specialises in sexual harassment and assault. At the launch of the petition, Young Labor women's officer and UTAS Women's Collective member Heidi La Paglia said that 'We know from the data that an astounding number of students experience harassment or violence, but the majority still don't know what the university can do to support them. Implementing a standard reporting system and a counselling service is a bare minimum requirement.'</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Normal">Sapphire Grant, the president of the UTAS Women's Collective, summed it up when she said that the university had been too slow to respond to the reality of sexual harassment and violence on campus. Ms Grant said: 'We need fast responses which tell us they believe us, that it is not our fault and that we will have justice. What we need is to have more trauma-informed staff so that, when people do disclose, they are told, "I believe you. It's not your fault."'</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:14.2pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
              <span class="HPS-Normal">I admire Laura Nilssen who, at the launch of the petition, spoke about her experience since being sexually assaulted in her first year at UTAS. It was pleasing that, on the day the Australian Human Rights Commission report was released, UTAS vice-chancellor, Professor Peter Rathjen, announced the university's dean of law, Professor Margaret Otlowski, would take up the new role of pro vice-chancellor of culture and wellbeing. As she said: 'one assault, one incident of harassment is one too many'. Indeed, it is, and we must all work to put an end to sexual assault and sexual harassment.</span>

                  <a href="00AOQ" type="MemberSpeech">
                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Senator MOORE</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Queensland</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">19:30</span>):  This evening I want to make a short contribution acknowledging the work that both Senator Ludlam and Senator Waters made in and gave to this place. The circumstances of their leaving us have been widely discussed in the media and I won't be looking into that at all. But because I happened to work with both of these senators across a number of areas, particularly on committee work, I thought it was important to make some contribution acknowledging the work that we had done and also to remind people that these two senators gave considerable work and considerable commitment and brought great dedication to their work in this place.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I have worked with Scott Ludlam across many committees over many years. Prior to his working as a senator in this place he worked with Senator Rachel Siewert, and that was where I met him. In his work, particularly in the areas of human rights and social justice, Scott was always generous in his contributions and quite discerning in seeing the best way to make his argument. Whilst I would never use the adjective 'vicious', he was sometimes quite direct in the way he called upon people to be true to their values in what they did in this place. This afternoon, when we had a visit from a delegation from Tibet and met with a number of people who are involved in the issues around the struggle for Tibet, it was almost unreal to sit there and not be able to turn around and see Senator Ludlam there, because that was one of the issues that he had fought for from the time he came into this place. I think that will be remembered.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">He also made many contributions—sometimes in the adjournment, sometimes not—around the issue of nuclear disarmament. He has been active at the international level in this space and came into the chamber many times to talk about the need for an international approach where Australia would take a role on issues of nuclear armaments, nuclear energy and the threat that nuclear processors hold for our planet. I think that his work will continue across many of the debates that take place here in the Senate. Scott was also extremely generous in his work with social community groups, and we talked many times about the way the Senate operated and how we could best use this place to get the message across about the issues that are important to so many people.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Senator Larissa Waters was a Queensland senator, and I shared many platforms with her not only during elections—where it seemed that her terms coincided with mine, so she would be there representing the Greens Party and I would be there for Labor—but also in wider community activities. For Senator Waters, the work that we did was increasingly focused on gender equality. I think people particularly remember the work that she did around the domestic violence report that we did a couple of years ago in this place. She pushed very strongly for a Senate inquiry into these issues and throughout the process was very active in ensuring that women and men across the community were engaged in the process and that we had the opportunity to hear real experiences and listen to people who understood the reality of the horror of domestic violence and people from community groups. We shared membership of many of the organisations as well and talked about practical ways to respond to these horrors. The area of gender equality has always been important to Larissa, and I know it will continue to be.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The environment is also very important for Larissa. I first met her as an environmental lawyer. She is completely dedicated to issues of the sanctity of the Great Barrier Reef. Many times we've heard her debating these issues in this place—bringing information to this place, not always receiving the overall support of the chamber, but steadfastly holding to her arguments and ensuring that those arguments were placed before the Senate.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">In the Senate, before people leave us, we often have the opportunity to take note of the activities of senators, to wish them well and to ensure that some of their important contributions are acknowledged by their fellow senators. This opportunity was not given, because of the way in which their retirements from this place occurred. But I do very much value the many years of discussion and debate that I shared with these two senators. I acknowledge their commitment to their cause. Whilst we didn't always agree on the policy results, I think that the energy and the commitment they brought were exactly the kinds of skills that we value in this place. I want to put on record my personal acknowledgement of the service they gave us and wish them well in their life after the Senate.</span>
