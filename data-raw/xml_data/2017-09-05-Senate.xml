                  </a>  At home in Melbourne we are fighting a losing battle to save 200 precious trees on our fabled St Kilda Boulevard, and it seems now the destructive tree-chopping disease must be in the air, because we returned here to Canberra yesterday to be greeted at the Parliament House Senate entrance security gate by a scene of destruction. While we were all away from the capital, authority was apparently granted for three majestic gum trees to be chopped down. Not a single protesting tree-hugger was in sight—not even a Greens senator. Mr President, I presume this was authorised. How many more will go? What is the rationale for the removal of traditional gums, which I assume were planted for the opening of this parliament 30 years ago? I chaired a crossbench meeting this morning, and no senators present had any idea this was going to happen. I'm wondering if somebody can fill us in.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Time">12:33</span>):  There are two options. This is something you could ask at question time or the end of question time. If the chamber is so of a mind for me to answer that now, I can give you a brief explanation now. It is a part of the security fence works. The trees primarily were removed for security fence purposes. Secondly, some of those trees were at end of life. Some trees have been interfering with the underground works—sewerage and electricity, I believe. Also, some of the trees had been incorrectly planted contrary to the original design; they're too big for the areas. And some are dangerous. In fact, I believe one actually crashed into the outside wall of a senator's office in high winds earlier this year. I believe 20 in total are going to be removed or have been removed already. Once the new fence goes through, they will be replaced with shrubs either side. I can give you further detail about that if you want to see me privately as well, Senator Hinch.</span>

                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Queensland</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">12:34</span>):  I rise to support the Fair Work Amendment (Repeal of 4 Yearly Reviews and Other Measures) Bill 2017. To finish off my contribution: last night I was talking about looking at, for example, the retail award, which I have had some experience with in my former life as a trade union official. I noted that there are something like 1.3 million retail workers across Australia, of which probably the majority would be covered by the award system that covers their conditions of employment. Let's say there are 200,000 members of the SDA, which covers those retail workers. That means that there's over a million workers across Australia in the retail industry who receive the benefits of the work that the unions—not the SDA, but other unions—perform in order to maintain our award system.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">For the benefit of those listening to parliament today: a lot of people are under the misapprehension that the award system is something that was generated by governments, and that conditions of employment are there because of government legislation or decisions of government. Whilst it's true to say that the architecture of our industrial relations system has come about because of the actions of various levels of government, it's important to make the point that the award system that we have in this country, which is virtually unique throughout the world, relies on the involvement of the trade union movement in order to ensure that those conditions of employment not only come into existence but they are also maintained and improved over a period of time.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">For the benefit of those listening, it's important to note that if we're looking at a four-yearly review, which we're now moving away from, there is still going to be the ongoing opportunity for individual unions and, indeed, employer organisations to approach the Fair Work Commission to make applications to vary the various awards. But it's important, generally, for people to be aware that our system of awards came into existence nearly a hundred or so years ago—probably around a hundred years—in the state systems, and that's where I've had my greatest exposure to the award system. Although we had the Commonwealth legislation in 1904 and various states enacted comparable industrial legislation shortly after that, a lot of people are not aware of the fact that it was actually the union movement which had to apply, in those early days, a hundred years or so ago, for the making of an award to cover the industries that those unions represented. Prior to that, there were no minimum conditions of employment. The union movement, on behalf of its members, rallied and made applications to the various tribunals around Australia in order to get minimum conditions of employment established. That is, I think, a fact that a lot of Australians are not aware of: the important role of trade unions in establishing the award system, in arguing for the improvement in the award system, and, in fact—what's most relevant to this topic today—in protecting the awards against attacks by employer organisations. Employers routinely come forward into the various tribunals to apply for reductions in either penalty rates or other conditions of employment, on the grounds of flexibility, et cetera. I think it is important to note that history.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">When it comes to the retail award, an award I am most familiar with, I know that the conditions that people take for granted in the awards that we have today came about because of the cases that were taken by unions as part of their day-to-day activities. For my own part, some of the more significant cases I was involved with were the introduction of a 38-hour week into the retail industry in the 1980s and the introduction of occupational superannuation as an award entitlement at around the same time. These are things that had to be fought for. People in the workforce don't understand the history of those things now, and, therefore, they take them for granted.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I want to skip forward to the creation of our modern award system, which was a historic achievement of the Rudd government and something which was initiated under the Howard government with the moving away from the dispute-settling power, under the Constitution, to the corporations power. The Howard government started the process of centralising our industrial relations system but was never able to complete the arduous task of bringing together a system of national awards applying to particular industries. That is, I think, a proud achievement of the Rudd government, but just because we had a Labor government in place didn't mean that unions had a lay-down misere to put in place reasonable conditions of employment in those various awards. In the case of the retail award, for example, there was dispute as to whether or not the national retail award that was going to come into existence in 2010 would have, say, the Sunday penalty rate of 200 per cent as a standard. So, in the lead-up to the introduction of that 2010 modern award, the SDA had to run a case in 2008 to set the Sunday rate at 200 per cent. We did the same thing in respect of the fast-food award, to have a 200 per cent penalty there. In December of 2008, the commission decided that the retail award would be set at 200 per cent for Sunday. Unfortunately, the fast-food award was set at 175 per cent for Sunday, and subsequently we found that employers in that industry sought to cut the 175 per cent rate to 150 per cent. So there have been an ongoing series of cases rotating around these issues of penalty rates. The awards were set in 2010 with the standard penalty rates in place, and then we had the two-yearly interim review of the modern award system, and once again employers took the opportunity to attack the penalty rates which had only just recently become a standard of the modern award, set by the commission. Between 2012 and 2013, the SDA had to run another case to defend the 200 per cent penalty against the employers seeking to reduce the rate to either zero per cent or 150 per cent. In the fast-food award, the SDA successfully defended the 150 per cent Sunday penalty against employers seeking a zero per cent penalty. By July of 2014, the Sunday penalty rate had reached 200 per cent.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">So it's important to note that the issue of penalty rates is not something which has been left unaddressed over the course of their history of being settled. It is something which has been very regularly prosecuted and which goes to the issue of the relevance of that particular rate. Then we moved to the first four-yearly review of the modern award system, which commenced in 2014. This was a further case—the third case in around six years or so—where employers were seeking to cut the 200 per cent award rate in retail and the 150 per cent rate in fast food. Of course, the rest is history. In February of this year, the Fair Work Commission, regrettably, decided to reduce the penalty rates in the retail and fast-food awards.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I make those points because I'm very concerned that a lot of people out there in the community do not understand what happens with these penalty rates, how they come into existence and the incredible amount of work that is involved in relation to the trade union movement maintaining our system of awards. And I reiterate the point that the work of the union movement is not only on behalf of its members. They, of course, are its primary objective, but, because of our unique system, we have millions of Australian workers across all industries who are the beneficiaries of the work of the trade union movement in maintaining our awards. I think that's important to note because we currently have a federal government which does not appreciate the work that unions do. In fact, on a regular basis—a daily basis—the government wants to demonise the trade union movement and demonise union officials, and that is not very helpful to a proper discourse on this issue, particularly at a time when we have people like the Governor of the Reserve Bank advising that unions should be more proactive in seeking wage increases, because at the moment we are stuck in a cycle of historically low levels of wage movements. So these are precisely the wrong behaviours from our federal government to address this issue. After all, Mr Morrison, the Treasurer, has indicated that low wage growth is probably the single greatest threat to our economy going into the future.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I also want to reiterate the point of maintenance and protection of award conditions. If there is one group of workers around Australia that really have benefited from the work of the union movement, it is retail workers in Victoria, who were confronted in 1993 with the abolition of the state award system by the then Premier, Mr Kennett. The award system was abolished on 1 March 1993. That meant that there were no penalty rates and no conditions of employment. It was basically a scorched-earth policy on the part of the Liberal government in Victoria. That left the SDA with the task of seeking to provide award coverage through the federal system. What then ensued was that the SDA Victoria branch, through the national office, had to serve a log of claims on 35,000 retail employers throughout the state of Victoria. This naturally took some time. On 29 December 2000—a historic occasion—a dispute was found between the SDA and 24,400 retail employers across Victoria. What ensued was the making of a roping-in award for 17,628 employers in August 2002. What eventually happened was that an interim award was made on 17 January 2003. Then there was a case, of course, on the issue of what was going to be the appropriate penalty rate for Saturday and Sunday work in the new federal award that applied in Victoria. That wasn't finally settled until 3 December 2003, over 10 years after the decision by the Liberal government of Victoria to abolish the award system.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I make that point because it highlights the fact that, if there's one group of workers throughout Australia that can say that their conditions of employment relate purely and solely to the work of a trade union, it is retail workers in Victoria. I pay tribute to Michael Donovan, the secretary of the Victorian SDA branch, and the work of that branch over that period of time. That is some of the history, which I think is very important for people to hear about in this place. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Coming forward to 2017, we know that workers' take-home pay is under attack by this government, a government that doesn't care about workers who are faced with cuts to their take-home pay. That is the explanation for the amendment which we seek to make in relation to this bill. Despite record low wages growth and rising unemployment and underemployment, this government continues to pursue policies to the detriment of Australia's most vulnerable workers. The cuts disproportionately affect women as well. We know that the cuts to penalty rates will not stop at the retail industry.    They will extend to other areas, and other employers are lining up to make similar applications. We know that there are proceedings in relation to clubs, hairdressing, beauticians and restaurants. If these cuts transpire, a further 323,000 workers are in immediate jeopardy of having their penalty rates cut. Labor, through our various union affiliates, has a great and proud history of standing up for workers' pay and conditions in the face of destructive coalition governments such as the one that we have today.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">In relation to the other aspects of the bill, I note that there is bipartisan support for the removal of the four-yearly reviews, and that is welcome. I note that there are other changes in this bill which are accurately described as amendments to the Fair Work Act, not as reforms. This government is trying to trumpet abolishing four-yearly reviews as a reform rather than what it is, simply the removal of a process of review from the legislation. We have also been concerned that the removal of the four-yearly review doesn't have any unintended consequences. It's important that the awards continue to be reviewed over time, as they have been, to meet the modern award objective. That's done through a process where workers and employers have the opportunity to have equal access and equal standing. I commend the bill with those amendments. <span style="font-style:italic;">(Time expired)</span></span>

                      <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Senator LEYONHJELM</span>
                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">New South Wales</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">12:50</span>):  I rise to speak to the Fair Work Amendment (Repeal of 4 Yearly Reviews and Other Measures) Bill 2017. This bill seeks to amend the Fair Work Act 2009 purportedly to respond to recommendations of the Productivity Commission's final report into the workplace relations framework. Measures include removing the requirement for the Fair Work Commission to conduct four-yearly reviews of so-called modern awards; enabling the commission to overlook minor errors when approving an enterprise agreement, provided it meets the no-disadvantage test; and, in order to respond to complaints regarding the former vice-president of the Fair Work Commission, applying the Judicial Misbehaviour and Incapacity (Parliamentary Commissions) Act 2012 in relation to past and present commission members.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">If indeed this bill did simply implement the Productivity Commission's recommendations then it would have my support, but it doesn't. The Productivity Commission recommended that the legislated objective of modern awards be changed to remove the objective of higher pay on weekends and public holidays, and insert an objective of regard for consumers. If this were done, the Productivity Commission said, modern awards would only need to be reviewed as necessary rather than at set four-yearly intervals. The recommendation to abolish four-yearly reviews of modern awards was explicitly tied to the changing of the modern award objective.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Unfortunately, the prospect of genuine industrial relations reform appears to have caused the government to experience a sudden loss of bladder control, so instead of actually implementing the Productivity Commission's recommendation the government has taken the soft, easy path of least resistance. With this bill, the government is retaining the current, flawed legislated objective of modern awards but is removing the requirement to review modern awards every four years. This is like rejecting your doctor's advice that a tumour be removed at once and then cancelling regular check-ups with your doctor. In the absence of changes to the objective, there is no value in changing the review requirement—in fact, there is a positive disadvantage. Retaining these reviews provides an opportunity to reduce the obligations in the awards and to promote employment.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This bill increases the likelihood that job-destroying modern awards will be retained, and it actually runs counter to the whole intent of the Productivity Commission recommendation. Accordingly, the Liberal Democrats cannot support this relic of the original recommendation to simply remove the four-year modern award review requirement as though this were a meaningful improvement.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This Fair Work amendment bill also has provisions to allow parliamentary commissions, which currently investigate judicial behaviour, to investigate misbehaviour by a member of the Fair Work Commission. The bill states that a member of the Fair Work Commission is subject to oversight by the Fair Work Commission president and by the minister, even if the member was first appointed to the Industrial Relations Commission.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The concept of Fair Work Commission oversight by a parliamentary commission is a good idea, but again the implementation by the government falls short. On current wording, it appears that proposed changes in the bill would imperil members for behaviour in the past, making such measures essentially retrospective. This is hardly reasonable.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">However, one Productivity Commission recommendation did manage to sneak into the bill without being gelded. This is the proposal to allow the Fair Work Commission to overlook minor errors that do not disadvantage employees when it's considering approving an enterprise agreement. This is, at least, a good change.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">In summary, however, with two out of three of its provisions proving to be clangers, this bill does not represent serious industrial relations reform and is largely form dressed up as substance. Since the Liberal Democrats are committed to real labour market deregulation rather than a cardboard cut-out of reform attached to a tricycle, I will therefore be opposing this bill.</span>

                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Victoria</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">12:55</span>):  It's always a pleasure to follow Senator Leyonhjelm with some of his colourful turns of phrase, which had me chuckling listening to that. I think the point you've made about the government losing bladder control can be applied not only to this bill but also to many of its activities at the moment. But, alas, I won't have the opportunity to talk about many of them today.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">But I do want to talk about this bill that is before us, the Fair Work Amendment (Repeal of 4 Yearly Reviews and Other Measures) Bill 2017, and some broader implications for industrial relations. The general proposition, of course, is to abolish the four-yearly review. It's something that employers and unions certainly agree on. The process of regular four-yearly reviews whether reviews are required or not is incredibly time consuming and costly for all involved, with little or no potential gain at the end of the day. The provisions that allow reviews as required, of course, remain.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The bill contains provisions which allow the Fair Work Commission to overlook minor technical or procedural errors when approving an enterprise agreement where those errors were not likely to have disadvantaged employees. As Senator Leyonhjelm indicated, that was a recommendation of one of the Productivity Commission reports, which I generally, as a senator, don't rely on. I find the Productivity Commission reports sometimes are all over the place and seem not to have a sense of reality or be grounded in reality when some of their recommendations are made. But in this case it's quite a practical recommendation—one which I thought was probably quite bleedingly obvious anyway. I think it was unfortunate that the commission were restricted by the act, or felt that they were restricted by the act, so that they couldn't deal with agreements that might have had a number wrong in the address or some other very minor technical matters which really didn't go to the substance of the agreement that was before the commission, and this bill fixes that. It certainly enables the Fair Work Commission to process those agreements now, even if they contain some of those minor technical errors.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The Productivity Commission report into Australia's workplace relations system was handed to the Abbott-Turnbull Liberal government on 30 November 2015, and it was publicly released on 21 December 2015. More than 1½ years after it was handed down, in what has seemed to become a standard operating procedure for this government, there hasn't been any formal response to that report. So it's been bouncing around there, with no formal response or consideration that we're aware of by the government. But at least some practical measures are being picked up nonetheless.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">But, of course, we're still in the dark. The public's still in the dark about which Productivity Commission recommendations the government does or does not support. Until the government responds to the individual recommendations, we're sort of getting them drip-fed, with no order and no rationale—just drip-fed through different bits of legislation as they come up. Unfortunately, even though the proposition of removing four-yearly reviews was put to the government by employers and unions, it appears that the bill differs from that which the employer associations and the ACTU put to the minister. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We note that the changes contained in this bill are accurately described as 'amendments' to the Fair Work Act, not 'reforms'. Clearly, they're not reforms. This government tries to trumpet abolishing four-yearly reviews as a reform, rather than what it is: removing a process of review from the legislation.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We have in this country a system of workplace relations which is no longer working, unfortunately. We only have to look at what's happening. We've got the profit share of GDP going up, yet we've got the wages share of GDP going down. We've got agreement-making going down—it's at an all-time low—yet award reliance is going up. Not only the share of wages in GDP is going down; actual wages themselves are either stagnant or in fact going backwards in real terms. Noncompliance with legal minimums is at an all-time high, so much so that the Fair Work Ombudsman just can't keep up and really doesn't have a good grip on the extent of noncompliance; and at the same time union membership and the very important role that unions play in compliance are going down as well. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We have a Fair Work Act that enables employers to simply go and terminate agreements they don't like, reducing wages and conditions that have been negotiated and agreed to in the past down to the very minimum legally allowed amount at the time. We see employers taking up that option more and more as their first option in negotiation, which is simply saying: 'Well, even though we've had these terms and conditions over many years and we've negotiated in good faith with our employees, we'll start from the bottom for our new negotiations. We won't start from the wages and conditions we have right now; we'll start from the bottom.' We see that happening time and time again, and we see workers in this country, after an application by an employer to terminate an agreement, sometimes losing 65 or 70 per cent of their income and conditions—because this act allows that to happen. It ought not allow that to happen. It's a new interpretation of the act that's enabled that to happen, and we don't see any action from the government to stop it. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We see employers organising workers to sign off on agreements, or to negotiate with a small group of workers to come to an agreement, on working conditions that will never apply to those workers themselves but to a different group of workers, often in a different state. We've seen that. We saw that in the CUB dispute, which is a classic example, where an agreement was made by, I understand, three workers in Western Australia. One of them, apparently, was the spouse of the human resources manager. They formed an agreement that was never going apply to them. It applied to Carlton United Breweries in Victoria, who had some 60 or 70 maintenance workers. They didn't get to negotiate that. Those workers had an agreement applied that they did not negotiate, that someone else negotiated, but it was an agreement that was never going to be applied to those people that negotiated it. We're seeing that happen more and more. And of course—no surprise—the reason that happened is, again, that wages were cut by 65 per cent to enable it to happen. Inevitably, after a long dispute and a change of owner of Carlton United Breweries, that was overturned, and those workers have gone back on to the rates and working conditions they had in the past. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We have seen also examples such as ExxonMobil, one of the biggest and richest companies in the world, which decided that it would contract out to a different contractor the cleaning and catering of facilities offshore. The people that had been doing that work for many, many years on a set of conditions were simply terminated because that company awarded a new contract for that whose employees—I don't know where they got the employees from—negotiated an award based agreement and won the contract, and those people who had been doing the work were simply removed. This is legal behaviour under the act. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We don't see the government moving to protect workers in those situations at all. That work was being done by people who had been doing it for many years. The reason the company terminated that contract was that someone would compete with that based on award conditions, the lowest legal set of conditions that are allowed in this country. That is not an isolated example. We see big companies doing it and we see small companies doing it: simply organising their workforce and their legal arrangements in order to undercut, sometimes even themselves.</span>

They've set up a company to compete against themselves. They've set up a company based on two supervisors at the moment negotiating, or pretending to negotiate, with dnata to set up an enterprise agreement that will apply to exactly the same set of conditions that applies to their existing workforce. Toll dnata intend to bid against themselves—to bid against their own workforce—for the work. They will go back. They're bidding based on the award rates of pay, the lowest legal minimum rates of pay that people can apply here. It's legal. A company can undermine their own workforce. How is that fair? How does that meet the objectives of the act to negotiate in good faith and negotiate above the lowest legal minimum wages that can be paid?</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">So we see employers engaging in what I think are the most unethical practices, which, unfortunately, are legal under the act, to circumvent enterprise bargaining and lower the wages and conditions and the agreements and deals that have been negotiated over many, many years, simply to put people on the lowest legal set of conditions that can be applied in this country. We see that all over the place. We see big employers doing it. As I said, ExxonMobil, one of the largest multinationals in the world, do it to save a few bucks at the expense of working people, their jobs and their incomes. We see smaller companies doing it.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This is an act that underpins an industrial relations system that sees agreement making going backwards and award reliance increasing; an act that underpins a system where the wages share of GDP is decreasing yet the profit share is increasing; an act that underpins a system where wages themselves are either stagnant or going backwards in real terms; and an act that underpins a system where noncompliance is rife. Noncompliance with even the lowest minimum wages and conditions is absolutely rife in this country.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">So it's hard not to conclude that the act itself is a serious problem and needs significant reform. But, instead of some of that significant reform, we see, as a priority, the removal of four-yearly reviews. While I say we agreed with that, it's hardly a reform. In itself, it doesn't protect one of those workers that I've talked about who is being sacked because the company can find someone else who is willing to do it cheaper, to save themselves a few bucks; it doesn't do that at all.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Where is the bill that is going to protect people's jobs and conditions? Where is the bill that is going to stop employers who don't like their existing agreement from simply terminating it and having everyone revert back to the award conditions, as a negotiating tactic? That's exactly what these companies are doing. Where is the bill that will protect penalty rates on weekends? Instead, this government allows the commission—</span>

                    </a>  to make a decision, taking what we consider to be an absolutely flawed position. Senator Williams says that we established it, and that's true. The Fair Work Act was voted on in this parliament—and supported by you, too, Senator Williams, I must say, and I thank you for that. It was to replace Work Choices. So let's just understand the low floor that the Fair Work Act was replacing. For those who might have forgotten Work Choices, it was a system where—don't worry about enterprise agreements—we were going back to an individual bargaining system, where it was take it or leave it. That is not too different to many circumstances that we're faced with now, but, as an individual, you were told to absolutely take it or leave it under Work Choices. We saw, as a result of that, penalty rates basically disappear in all those Work Choices agreements.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">So the government's finally getting their way: they are clawing back penalty rates; they want penalty rates to be less. We've heard the Prime Minister say that he supports the decision of the Fair Work Act to start reducing penalty rates for some people in some industries. We think that's the thin end of the wedge. It will continue to happen.</span>

                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The government will have an opportunity, in this bill, to actually protect those penalty rates—if it wants to protect working people in this country. We know that around 700,000 people, all low-paid workers, are likely to be affected by this decision, and the government has an opportunity to support the amendments that I understand we'll be moving in the committee stages of this bill to protect those penalty rates—to put them back; to acknowledge that the Fair Work Commission has got it wrong in this instance.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We'll hear lots of squawking about, 'You've got to accept the independent umpire's decision'—as if that's what they've always done. Well, we say: when they get it wrong, that's what we're here to do, as legislators—to fix those wrong decisions. But when those over there didn't like the Road Safety Remuneration Tribunal's decision, not only did they rush in here a bill to overturn that decision; they then abolished the whole tribunal! We see the crocodile tears from the government; we hear them saying, 'You should accept the decisions of independent tribunals,' but their track record has been not just to rush legislation in to overturn decisions they didn't like but to abolish the whole tribunal.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We say with absolute confidence that we don't believe that the lowest-paid people in this country should be punished by having their penalty rates cut, and this government has an opportunity to do something about it. They're the bills that we should be dealing with. We should be dealing with bills that are fixing the exploitation that is allowed under the Fair Work Act—the exploitation not only of vulnerable workers but often of workers who are very highly skilled, in highly unionised areas, because the tools that are at the employers' disposal now are so far weighted in favour of employers against employees that the objects of the act are failing. They are fundamentally failing. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We don't have a system which is providing fair and just outcomes. We don't have a system that's encouraging people to negotiate agreements in good faith to improve productivity—which is, by the way, at an all-time high. We don't have an act and a system that's encouraging those things to happen. So I wait. I think it'll be a forlorn hope, but I do wait in hope that the government will start bringing those sorts of constructive bills—bills that work and improve the lot and the working conditions of the low-paid workers in this country.</span>

                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">
                    <a href="CPR" type="MemberSpeech">
                      <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Senator RHIANNON</span>
                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">New South Wales</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">13:15</span>):  The Fair Work Amendment (Repeal of 4 Yearly Reviews and Other Measures) Bill 2017 is supposedly about consolidating minimum safety nets. That sounds promising, because there is so much work to be done as workers' wages and conditions have been run down over many years. You would expect the bill to be about minimum safety standards and that it would have some teeth, but the teeth are certainly missing here. You'd expect it to have teeth on issues of job security, reducing casualisation and establishing minimum wages and conditions for all workers. And there is also the very important issue of the right of workers to strike, which is recognised internationally as a human right. I will come back to that.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Industrial relations in this country are out of kilter to the point that it's not just damaging wages of workers and their conditions at work but actually damaging the economy. That is shown in the low wages growth. We have the Governor of the Reserve Bank talking about the very fact of low wages growth. He's talking about it in the context of the economy.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">That surely should be a wake-up call to this government, but, as we know, this government introduced these industrial relations laws to beat down unions. It's not even about a fair balance. I think a fair balance would be about looking at the redistribution of wealth that's needed in this country, considering the millions and often billions of dollars in profit these companies make when there are so many workers—increasing numbers of workers—who are casualised, meaning they don't get any conditions. They don't have holiday pay. They're deprived of so many other conditions. There's all this evidence that's coming forward about penalty rates. Many of them don't get paid their penalty rates. Even when they try to get them—and I heard Senator Marshall not in his speech today but yesterday or a couple of days ago, and he made the remark and really spelt it out clearly. It is about when workers become aware the penalty rates are owed. The very business model of these companies is based on this. They know some workers will apply for their penalty rates and most of the workers won't get it, because they will give up because the whole system is so complicated. It shouldn't be like that. Companies should be obliged to follow the conditions that are set out.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">So we come to this deeply minimalist bill. To repeat: industrial relations are so out of kilter in this country. It's deeply loaded against workers. There are so many hoops that they have to jump through when it comes to the negotiations. Effectively, the companies hold all the cards. Do they negotiate at all? If they do, under what circumstances? This is what we need to face here: the Fair Work Act is about curtailing workers' ability to organise.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">So now we start to unravel the sorts of issues that should be dealt with if the government were sincere about bringing forward some real safety nets in terms of wages and conditions. Central to the problem are these extreme limits on the right to strike. In a country like Australia, where the right to strike has been so obliterated by how workers are able to conduct themselves, it's again worth remembering what the international situation is and why it has been so wound back in Australia.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The right to strike is recognised by the United Nations body the International Labour Organization. That same body has given many warnings to Australia about how, and to what degree, our industrial relations laws are out of step with international standards. And why does this international body recognise the right to strike as a human right? Because they recognise the imbalance in relationships here. If you are a CEO working for a corporation, if you have some level of management there, if you've got a big fancy office in a big building at the top end of town, you have all the power. The Turnbull government and successive Liberal-National governments over the years, at a state and federal level, have brought in industrial relations laws that make it much easier for these companies to get away with ripping off workers. And we're at a point now where it's disastrous for the individual who doesn't get paid a fair wage. The company is not obliged to follow the laws. And it's disastrous for the economy. So that's why we need to inject this issue of the right to strike back into how industrial relations is conducted in this country.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Over the years we've seen incredible hysteria from the media and from politicians saying that this is absolutely irresponsible and will destroy the economy. It doesn't destroy the economy. If a company knows that it has to give a fair wage to the workers, time and again you will see that these negotiations can proceed, the economy works and the workers get a fair wage. But under the current system the companies get away with it. The right to strike is just about obliterated from laws in Australia, and inequality in this country is growing.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">It would probably surprise a number of members in this place that, believe it or not, in the United States and Britain the right to strike has more prominence than it has in this country. It's much easier for workers to collectively organise. That's what we're talking about here. How did the right to strike come about? At the end of the day the only power workers had was to collectively organise and periodically remove their work from their employer. All they could do was withdraw what they give to the boss—that is, their work. Why did that do that? So they could get a living wage and decent conditions.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We can see that the laws have gone too far in this country. We need to repeat time and time again how amazing it is that the Governor of the Reserve Bank has taken up this issue of wage stagnation in this country. 'Wage stagnation' is a nice economic term that we read about in the business pages of the papers. But it's also talking about wage theft. That has to come into this. Wage theft is extreme in this country. I've had the opportunity to sit in on some Senate inquiries and it is extraordinary to hear about the degree of robbery, the loss of wages, from some of the most disadvantaged workers in this country, who have little ability to organise. It's inspiring to hear of their experiences on the job: under very difficult conditions they've come together, they've organised and they're fighting back.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Let's remember that this bill is about addressing minimum safety standards. Yes, there is a real urgency there. I think it's worth reminding ourselves of the sorts of measures that should be taken up if we want to talk about the minimum safety net. My colleague the Greens industrial relations spokesperson in the House of Representatives, Adam Bandt, summed this up well when he spoke on this bill in the House. He said:</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">There is a suite of amendments that could be made to the Fair Work Act to actually improve job security, minimum wages and conditions and the right to organise and to bargain for the people of this country, and the government is turning a blind eye to that.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">That sums up what's before us now. There are some measures in this bill that you wouldn't argue against, but it's absolutely minimalist in terms of the incredibly serious situation we now find ourselves in.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I will just deal with some of the issues in the bill. With respect to the bill's narrow approach to a minimum safety net of terms and conditions, yes, we need a simple, plain English modern award system that works to reduce the unnecessary overlap of modern awards. We're not disputing that. Four-yearly reviews have been one of the mechanisms to achieve this. I can see the argument for a minimalist approach, and the government has put the case, but one of our worries is: does removing the four-yearly reviews lead to unintended consequences? That's a real issue here. Are we losing one of the few mechanisms that there are to handle this?</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I want to go back to the big picture I've been covering in this speech to the Senate today, about the imbalance between workers and corporate Australia. Again, remember the profits that these companies have and the power that they have, with the backup of the law and the state. It is extreme. It makes it so hard. That's why we need to put back on the agenda the right to strike. Australia is in a shameful position of having ignored that human right for so long and ignored the warnings from the ILO, the International Labour Organization. Why do we have record profits and low wage growth? How have we arrived at that situation? It's because there is a deeply flawed industrial relations system in this country. That's why I want to pull those issues together and bring them into focus with regard to this bill.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The government make out that they're doing something. How many IR bills have we had in recent weeks in this chamber? They come up with their fancy titles for bills about protecting vulnerable workers. It's all a sham. They are continuing to work for their constituency, corporate Australia, to make it even tougher for workers in this country. It will change. I'm always an optimist. The people will organise and fight back, but in the meantime people are doing it tough. They're suffering, and it sits at the feet of this government.</span>

                      <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Senator LINES</span>
                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Western Australia</span>—<span class="HPS-MinisterialTitles">Deputy President and Chair of Committees</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">13:27</span>):  I too rise to speak on the Fair Work Amendment (Repeal of 4 Yearly Reviews and Other Measures) Bill 2017. Before I go to the elements in the bill, some of which Labor has managed to convince the government to change for the better and some of which we will continue to debate, I want to put this four-yearly review and the Fair Work Act in a broader context. I listened when Senator Ketter was speaking about his time at his union, where a considerable amount of time was spent on the award modernisation process. I too, at that time, worked at United Voice. For a period of time I was responsible for industrial relations at the national union. I absolutely agree with Senator Ketter that the award modernisation process was something that unions were heavily invested in and spent an inordinate amount of time on, particularly as United Voice is a broa<span style="&#xD;&#xA;    font-size:11pt;&#xD;&#xA;  ">d</span>-based membership union. There might have been one or two awards that United Voice didn't have an interest in, so we were extremely busy over that two-year period.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Industrial relations in this country really matter. I think what gets lost—certainly by the government—is how industrial relations can protect the rights of vulnerable workers. When we look at award workers, I think what's overlooked or perhaps forgotten by the government is that it's predominantly low-wage workers in this country who rely on the protections of the award. We already know through academic research that there's an enormous difference between the conditions of female and male workers. Yesterday was Equal Pay Day. We know that we have a shocking gender pay gap in this country, which hasn't moved for 30 years. My state of Western Australia has the highest wage gap in the country, and there's a very solid reason for that. It's because another Liberal government, under Mr Court and his industrial relations minister, Mr Kierath, absolutely tore the award system to bits.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Even though modern awards are much smaller documents and cover only a range of matters, if we want to appreciate the value of awards in this country and what happens when you start tinkering with awards and the protections around them—and I would argue that four-yearly reviews are a protection to award workers even though they have been used in the wrong way by employers—we only have to look to Western Australia to see what the Court government did when, for the first time in our history, it said to the employers in Western Australia, 'You can undercut the award.' We had long held to the view that awards were the safety net. They were the very minimum rate of pay which could be paid to workers in this country. That was not so for Mr Court and his extremely aggressive industrial relations minister, Mr Kierath. For the first time in Western Australia, and indeed the country, employers were able to undercut awards. Awards that had been put in place a hundred years ago were able to be undercut.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">What we saw almost immediately in areas where wages are in competition—this is something the government doesn't seem to appreciate—was that when margins are slim, in contracting industries like security and catering, or where there's stiff competition, such as in the early childcare sector, wages are a predominant part of payroll—in the early childhood sector probably making up 75 per cent of the pay. When people are competing in the contracting industry for a contract, if they can snip wages, that's what they'll do. Under the workplace agreement system in Western Australia, for the first time ever, employers were able to strip away award conditions so that overnight, we saw the contract cleaning rate in Western Australia drop by $2 an hour. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Of course, despite most companies actually not wanting to cut wages, when they were up against a big employer who did cut wages, in order to compete they had to go to the lowest common denominator. We saw penalty rates disappear. We saw the hourly rate disappear. We saw ridiculous contracts come into place and zero minimum where you were just told to come in at a whim. And we saw wages and conditions of cleaners—they were the first area that was attacked—disappear almost immediately. What impact does that have on a worker? First of all, cleaners thought they could move to another contract cleaning company. But, lo and behold, they soon found out it didn't matter where they went. The employers were also in the race to the bottom. Their wages were not protected. What happened was that cleaners started working two jobs. I know it's quite common to hear in this place that people are working two jobs. But we heard of cleaners working two and three jobs, and sometimes four jobs, just to try and make up for the loss in wages that had hit their pockets because of this abandonment of the wages system. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">It didn't just stop in the contract catering industry. It happened in the contract security industry, where rates of pay dropped. Let's be very clear here. We're not talking about very high rates of pay. We're talking about people on low rates of pay—in today's wages, $20 to $21 an hour. In those days under Court-Kierath, it would have been about $15 or $16 an hour. These were not high-wage workers. They were also part-time workers. The security industry was next. We saw one big contractor drop rates and all the rest of them follow. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I heard Senator Birmingham in here yesterday during question time talk about all the innovation that's going on in the early childhood sector. That's a low-paid sector and remains so today because the government tore apart any of the principles that Labor had put in place to increase wages in that sector. But then young workers were given disgraceful, two-page individual agreements. They weren't really individual agreements; the employer would put 15 agreements exactly the same across a childcare centre. So we saw in the early childhood sector, also, a stripping away of wages. Why? It's because, predominantly, it's an area that attracts young people who have no idea about the history of what the wages were in that sector before individual workplace agreements. Of course, if you said no and went to another early childhood service, the chances were that they would have the same individual agreements.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We also saw during this stage employers and employer consultants making a lot of money out of these shocking individual contracts, because most small employers don't know a lot about industrial relations, so they fall victim to people who come around and say, 'We can take care of your industrial relations.' So we saw a lot of shonky individual agreements being peddled by the Chamber of Commerce and Industry of Western Australia and by a whole lot of other consultancy groups. Some of them were very bad, and some of them, because they were put out by shonky operators, were easily knocked off in the various courts you could go to. But, again, that was expensive. Workers were often afraid to put their hand up and be singled out in the workplace, so times were tough.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Certainly from a Western Australian perspective and my experiences under Court-Kierath, with really bad workplace agreements legislation, I can see the value of having protections in our industrial relations system and the value of having a floor that you can't go below. I certainly wouldn't want to see this legislation have any unintended consequences that make it easy for employers to once again start stripping away award conditions. We've already seen some of this, and, as I said earlier—in the federal arena under the Fair Work Act—most low-paid workers still rely on awards.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Again, if you look at the early childhood sector, there's something like 6,000 services across Australia. It's predominantly women who work in the early-childhood space. Many of them are young women who are there because they love the job and really value the opportunity of working with young children. But, of course, love doesn't pay the bills, and it certainly doesn't pay the rent. Many young women find themselves at the age of 27 still living at home because they love their job but they're not making enough money to be able to even rent a property, and buying a property is certainly out of the question. Those workers across the 6,000 childcare services in this country really do rely on the award service—absolutely. That pays their wage. These workers are on $20 or $21 an hour. These are workers with diplomas and certificate IIIs. Again, we see the furphy of, 'If you just get yourself qualified, you'll get a better rate of pay.' But the reality is that, for women workers and low-paid workers on the award, they need all of the protections that we as a parliament can make sure are in the act.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We're not just talking about early childhood educators. We're also talking about cleaners—the cleaners in this place. We know the story here. They haven't had a wage rise for years and years and years. They were part of the Clean Start Collective Agreement which the government cancelled, and those workers are now back on the award. We're also talking about disability services. We've seen the NDIS, which is a champion piece of legislation that Labor put in place. In 20 years to come, it will absolutely be the new Medicare. It's a brilliant piece that enables people who have a disability to be properly cared for and looked after and to be able to be independent in this country. But disability-care workers are extremely precarious workers. They get a text message when they're required to work. This is what we've come to in this country. They get a text message that says, 'Come to work today; we've got an hour of work for you,' or, 'Come to work next week; we've got two hours work for you,' or, 'Sorry, we don't need you today—don't come.' That's all done by text message. This is not just about the workers out there picking tomatoes, which I certainly heard about as the chair of the Senate inquiry that looked at visa workers. These are everyday, ordinary Australians, and it's not their pocket money, as some people may choose to imagine. Again, these are women. This is their bread and butter. This is how they are making the money to feed their kids, to pay their rent and to pay their school fees—yet there is the indignity of receiving a text message. There are very few home care disability workers in Western Australia who actually see the boss and get a roster. Most of them get a text.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">So, there again, workers need whatever protections we can offer them through our industrial relations system to ensure that that abuse stops. I'm sure most people in this place would agree with me that getting a text saying to come to work or not to come to work is a very inappropriate way to run your industrial relations system and to run your workforce. It is just not appropriate. But that's how low we've come.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">With hospitality workers we saw the attacks. We begged the government to step in and do something about penalty rates. For anyone on the government side to think that losing penalty rates does not have an impact on low-paid workers again demonstrates how out of touch they are, because you can't lose 15, 30 or 40 per cent of your income without it having an impact, particularly when you're on 20 bucks an hour. The reason people work on the weekends is to increase their take-home pay so that they don't have to work three or four jobs, or be an Uber driver or be a worker who gets texts from the disability services employer. Decent jobs—what's happened to that notion? What's happened to the notion of decent pay? What's happened to the notion of decent work? It's just gone. It's as if you don't appreciate that at the end of these reforms are human beings who vote, thankfully, and who can speak for themselves. If you cared to ask them, they could tell you what impact losing penalty rates has on them, award-reliant workers.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I read in the media that the employers are now after hairdressers. Everyone in this place who goes to a hairdresser knows that they stand up all day. I don't know how they do that. Their backs must ache at the end of it. They must get repetitive strain injuries, because not only are they standing but they're standing with their arms at shoulder height most of the day when doing people's hair. They're dealing with chemicals. I've seen a lot of them using chemicals without gloves. Again, these are low-paid workers—20 bucks an hour—yet we're going after their penalty rates. I saw an employer the other day quoted in a newspaper as saying that if they were able to reduce penalty rates they could employ another hairdresser. Goodness gracious me, do we really want another hairdresser on low pay? How does that help the economy? How does reducing people's income and putting more people into low-paid work help the economy? It doesn't. When we have the governor of the Reserve Bank coming out and saying, 'Hey, we've gone a bit far,' we really do need to sit up and take note.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I want to make sure that when we tinker with the system, when we look to abolish the four-yearly reviews, we really understand what we are doing. I want a commitment from the government that any unintended consequences that start to give employers a back-door way to reduce award wage workers' wages even further will be looked at. Already, under minimum awards we have minimum start times of zero for some workers. This is just not on. It does not create a modern, productive economy. It just does not.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">If the loss in penalty rates is carried over to the hairdressing industry, where will it stop? Are we going to go after aged-care workers next, because I'll tell you what: I was speaking to some aged-care workers just last Sunday and they're very nervous. Are we really going to attack the penalty rates of workers who look after some of the most vulnerable people in Australia—the people in aged-care homes? I hope not. Really, it is time for the government to show some leadership on this issue and say: 'Stop. This is the line in the sand. We will not support any further attack on penalty rates.' But I suspect the gate is open now. Certainly, Labor have said all the way along, 'We are very worried about where this penalty rate onslaught will stop.' </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">But I'm pleased to say that, with this bill, the government has listened to some of the amendments that we have put forward, and we will put forward further amendments. The time has probably come for those four-yearly reviews to be abolished. The current review hasn't finished. There was a time and place for them. Labor are always prepared to look at sensible, fair amendments, but only if they don't disadvantage the lowest paid workers in this country. Certainly, when you come out of a union such as my union, United Voice, you see the lowest-paid workers in this country, you see disadvantage every day and you see exploitation by employers. That's not to suggest there aren't employers who do the right thing—of course, there are. But when we inadvertently or when we deliberately put pressure into the system that ultimately impacts on workers, that's when it starts to be unfair. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We should be a country that proudly looks at how we have a system which protects workers, particularly low-paid workers, to make sure they can't be exploited. We've seen some shocking cases of exploitation across all aspects of this country. It doesn't matter where you work now, there's exploitation. I would seek assurances from the minister that this bill doesn't have adverse consequences, and, if it does, that we will look to amend those very quickly, because workers right now, in 2017, need their unions and they certainly need the protections of really strong legislation to make sure that they are not being taken advantage of, they are not being ripped off and they are able to join their union when they choose to protest their rates of pay. </span>

                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">
                    <a href="GB6" type="MemberSpeech">
                      <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Senator JACINTA COLLINS</span>
                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Victoria</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">13:47</span>):  In speaking to the Fair Work Amendment (Repeal of 4 Yearly Reviews and Other Measures) Bill 2017, I'll commence by reflecting on, unfortunately, what it is not, rather than what it is. As someone who played a significant role in the introduction of the Fair Work Act, its provisions and, indeed, the necessity to overcome the Work Choices regime that was introduced by the previous government, I'm well aware of the need to review the provisions of the act and the paucity that this bill itself actually represents. So it was interesting to listen to Senator Rhiannon talk about how minimalist these provisions are, as indeed they are. Senator Lines was just then discussing some of the history in workplace relations matters in Australia over the last couple of decades. I want to take just a moment to give credit to Senator Marshall, who from opposition has put in significant energy to ensure that, in the absence of the government addressing these issues, the provisions of the Fair Work Act are being adequately reviewed through Senate inquiry. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The main thing that this bill is not is an adequate response to a review of the Fair Work Act. It's a drip-feed process. The government drip-feeds a few matters and issues here and there. What the government does not have is a workplace relations policy—no policy at all—because it doesn't want to admit to what its real agenda is. And then, indeed, when we do see elements of that real agenda, such as the onslaught of cuts to penalty rates for Australian workers, it attempts to use the complexity of some of the elements of the Fair Work Act to shield and hide what is really being proposed. So I thought I would commence today by taking a step back and revisiting some of the process issues here. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This bill is a lost opportunity. It is a lost opportunity to adequately respond to the operations of the Fair Work Act. It's not, as the government pretends, reform. Simply removing the review process from the Fair Work Act is not workplace relations reform. Indeed, if we go back—and I questioned this approach at the time—to how the Fair Work Act was proposed to be reviewed, we're going back to the Productivity Commission report on Australia's workplace relations system, which was handed to the Abbott-Turnbull Liberal government on 30 November 2015. It was that long ago: November 2015. At the time, I questioned in my own mind whether the Productivity Commission was the appropriate agency to conduct such a review.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Those who have watched the work of the Productivity Commission—perhaps with one major exception, which this government ignored: paid parental leave—would have seen a fairly narrow economic assessment of the circumstances. Any understanding about the application of workplace relations policy in Australia comprehends that we have this separate system because we understand in Australia that simply relying on the vagaries of economic policy is not appropriate to establish decency within our society and decent and appropriate work for Australians. But, fairly predictably at the time, the government referred the operation of Australia's workplace relations system to the Productivity Commission.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">You would expect that a conservative government would have responded to such a report by now, but no. Apart from the drip feed of a few issues such as this one, almost 1½ years after it was handed down, in what has become a fairly standard operating procedure for this government in relation to workplace relations matters we still have no government response to the report—lazy government, distracted government. There has been no government response to a report that you would think would fit fairly neatly within their workplace relations policy space. So the Australian public are in the dark about which Productivity Commission recommendations the government does or does not support. Until the government responds to individual recommendations, all we have is the drip feed that this bill represents. And then we have the pretence that this bill is about more than what it actually is. This is not reform. This is simply dealing with a review mechanism—and indeed not even in the way that the parties had proposed that these issues be addressed.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The Labor opposition has been looking carefully at some of the potential unintended consequences. As other speakers have noted, it seems that the government is prepared to accept some of the amendments to deal with those issues, and they'll be canvassed in a bit more detail in the committee stage debate. In the absence of a workplace relations policy, though, we have seen instead a misrepresentation by this government of how enterprise bargaining operates, within the Fair Work Act, as a shield for their proposed penalty rates cuts. Indeed, the Fair Work Commission's decision in relation to penalty rates fits neatly into the paradigm I was just describing in relation to drawing on the Productivity Commission to reflect on workplace relations policy. Even so, in order to justify and maintain its support for significant cuts to penalty rates, what this government does instead is to completely misrepresent how enterprise bargaining operates within the Fair Work Act.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The best example was yesterday. Since the minister raised this issue in question time yesterday, I thought I would use this opportunity to describe what was wrong, what was inaccurate, what was fallacious about the material the minister was presenting to the Senate, in relation to the operations of enterprise bargaining. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We saw in <span style="font-style:italic;">The Australian</span> yesterday a piece written by Ewin Hannan, claiming 50 hours to cover weekend rates cut. The report itself describes an analysis by the Department of Employment that was submitted to the current Senate inquiry into penalty rates. What hasn't been presented and what needs to be presented is what is wrong with that analysis. Let me refer, for example, to a press release from the SDA outlining some of those issues around what was wrong. It says:</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">An analysis by the Industrial Relations Minister, Michaelia Cash—</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">or her department—</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">is a manipulation of data that deliberately skews the facts and ignores the benefits of Enterprise Agreements for workers.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Why? To shield their cut to penalty rates. SDA national secretary Gerry Dwyer says, 'The report by the minister is fundamentally flawed by using arbitrary dates for her comparison rather than an accurate comparison using dates recommended by the BOOT.' You don't need to only rely on the SDA here. Look at the comment in that article from the ACTU, where it says:</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">We do not celebrate the fact our system locks in terms and conditions that may be overtaken by the safety net during the life of an agreement.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The minister's analysis doesn't deal with that, because the department simply used arbitrary dates. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Perhaps the biggest misrepresentation this minister continues to make is how enterprise bargaining involves rolling up penalty rates into higher base rates of pay and working conditions. She simply draws comparisons between the Sunday work rate and the award rate without all the other factors, including a higher base rate of pay. The reason they continue to do this is that they want to shield their real agenda about cutting penalty rates and, supposedly, creating more employment by cutting workers' rates of pay. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">People who have experienced this government in its earlier forms or the workplace relations policies that have been applied understand where that agenda leads. That agenda leads to the likes of the industrial regime in Victoria under Jeff Kennett: five conditions of employment. Just five. That's part of the history about why most Australian workers moved into the federal jurisdiction. Then they came across Work Choices, and they understood again that the absence of a no-disadvantage test damages workers. So, instead of this minister adequately dealing with how enterprise bargaining operates within the Fair Work Act, we have just one process issue in this bill. Instead of this government having a workplace relations policy that they're prepared to be up-front about and debate, and present to the Australian public at large, we have this drip-feed of piecemeal measures while, at the same time, arguing that Australian workers should lose their penalty rates. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I'm not surprised this government doesn't understand the sorts of issues that workers in retail and hospitality value. Let me read a few of them that are in the agreements that this minister has ignored. They represent things such as improvements to how rosters and hours of work can be changed. They represent guaranteed minimum shifts of work. They represent shorter maximum shifts so that workers can combine their work with their family responsibilities. They represent other types of leaves and support for workers—conditions that those workers have argued for in enterprise bargaining. These are the elements that this minister ignores in the trite analysis that she has allowed her department to present to a Senate committee, and she should be appalled that the quality of that work has been allowed.</span>

Senator Canavan's case and the issue of dual citizenship arose at a time when he didn't know the full facts. Subsequently, further facts became available. Clearly, Senator Canavan took the precautionary step of standing aside at that point in time. Further to that, more advice became available and, on very strong advice, the Prime Minister has asked both Barnaby Joyce, the Deputy Prime Minister, and I to stay on in our ministerial roles. I would point out that, yet again, we see from those on the other side another opportunity to ask a question about the issues that are important to the Australian people being missed.</span>

Perhaps the tactics team opposite needs a little bit of help. A question that would be important to the Australian people is: 'Could I ask the minister what the coalition government is doing to improve energy affordability and reliability?' And my answer would be very clear—this coalition government is doing much to improve it. We are providing real solutions around Snowy Hydro 2.0, that the people of this nation see as a nation-building project. We've seen the Prime Minister and the energy minister—</span>

What a great and important question by Senator Slade Brockman. Congratulations on your appointment to the Senate and your first question. The Turnbull government is pursuing a pro-growth, pro-opportunity, pro-jobs agenda. We are pursuing an economic agenda which supports free enterprise and reward for effort and which encourages people to stretch themselves to work hard in the pursuit of opportunity and success. All of this is underpinned by an appropriately generous and well-targeted welfare safety net which looks after those in need of support.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">Our policy agenda is all about achieving equality of opportunity for Australians to get ahead, not equality of outcome. Our focus on growth, jobs and opportunity is delivering. The ANZ job advertisements index showed another strong result in August, increasing by two per cent, the sixth straight rise. The number of job advertisements in August increased to more than 181,000. Those opposite are not interested. That is 13.3 per cent higher than last year, and it's the highest level of job ads in over 6½ years. Employment also has continued to grow, increasing by two per cent over the past year, stronger than the average rate of the past decade of 1.6 per cent. This year over 240,000 new jobs were created. The most recent monthly jobs statistics show that full-time jobs growth over the last six months was the strongest in almost 40 years. In fact, since we came into office in 2013, 736,500 new jobs have been created, compared to just 201,000 new jobs over six years of Labor. </span>

There is, of course, much more work to be done. We have already been able to reduce the business tax rate for businesses generating up to $50 million a year in turnover down to 25 per cent, but we need to do more. We call on the Senate to support the government's legislation to reduce business taxes to 25 per cent for all businesses across Australia, because, as the current Labor leader used to say in years gone by, a more competitive business tax rate will drive additional investment, increase productivity, increase the number of jobs and increase real wages over time. That is precisely what Bill Shorten used to believe before he embraced the socialist agenda of the past. <span style="font-style:italic;">(Time expired)</span></span>

Indeed, I was very recently with the member for Whitlam, down at the wonderful Labor seat of Whitlam, announcing $10 million for a road, which was very well received by Stephen Jones, the member for Whitlam. This is appropriate decision-making by a minister, and I will continue to do so.</span>

In the first instance, I would reject 95 per cent of the allegations made in Senator McKim's question. In relation to the closure of the Manus Regional Processing Centre, with Australia's support, Papua New Guinea will close the Manus Regional Processing Centre by 31 October 2017. In relation to the management of services at the regional processing centre, this is a matter for the government of Papua New Guinea, as Senator McKim well knows. In answering this question I remind Senator McKim that, yet again, despite his false bravado, despite his rhetoric, he is responsible, along with the policies of the Australian Greens, when they supported the policies of the former Labor government, for why that Manus Island centre is there.

It did not ask the minister to reflect on one single matter that happened in the past. Every aspect of my question was future focused.

Minister Dutton, just like Minister Morrison and those on this side of the chamber, puts national security as the No. 1 issue for the Commonwealth government. Senator McKim, unlike you, we know that a government that cannot control its borders, quite frankly, does not deserve to be in government. </span>

This government and this minister remain committed to supporting Papua New Guinea to close the Manus Island Regional Processing Centre by 31 October 2017. In fact the minister himself was recently in Papua New Guinea with Prime Minister O'Neill and Papua New Guinea's Minister for Immigration and Border Protection on Friday, 1 September 2017. Both sides acknowledged the requirement for continued close cooperation on implementation of the regional resettlement arrangement and discussed plans for the Manus Island RPC closure.

Yet again, as we discussed yesterday, the Senate will be aware—and Senator Collins is clearly aware—that there has been a large amount of publicity recently regarding penalty rates in enterprise agreements. It is particularly concerning that hundreds of thousands of workers and a large number of employers are paid less on a Sunday than they would receive under the relevant award. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">An analysis presented to the Senate's committee on education and employment looked at approximately 108 enterprise agreements that large employers made with various unions. Guess what? Of these 108 agreements, 70 set out pay rates less than the award rate for Sunday work. Can you believe it? That is for at least one group of employees. Now, of these 70 agreements, 55 of them—or 79 per cent—covered at least one union. That's right—79 per cent of those agreements negotiated by a union cut Sunday penalty rates. This is the interesting thing: these are the same unions that are currently running a campaign called Save Our Weekend. The interesting thing about that slogan is what is missing from it: Save our Weekend 'from us'. Because, the last time I checked, for those on the other side when a big union and a big employer do a deal to cut or abolish penalty rates, that is okay, but when the independent Fair Work Commission that they put together and appointed does it for small business, suddenly all bets are off. </span>

The analysis presented to the education and employment committee indicates that workers who work only or primarily on Sunday would, in most cases, be better off under the relevant award than they are under agreements negotiated by the unions those opposite represent. I'll give an example. Workers at McDonald's are receiving $8.08 less an hour on a Sunday than they would under the relevant award. Workers at Woolworths are receiving $5.26 less, and workers at Coles are receiving $5.42 less than what they would have received under the relevant award. The interesting thing is this: the SDA and United Voice, I have to say, get the gold star. They get the gold star for negotiating away workers' penalty rates, but not far behind, colleagues, you'd be pleased to know, are the AWU and Bill Shorten. <span style="font-style:italic;">(Time expired)</span></span>

This is what those on the other side don't understand. Or maybe they do, and that's why they stick up for big businesses and big unions doing deals to advantage themselves. But the current disparity, and we saw it in an article in today's paper, makes it difficult for small businesses—mum-and-dad businesses—which actually employ the majority of Australians to compete on a Sunday with larger businesses who pay their workers less as a result of doing a deal with the unions represented by those opposite. The biggest losers in these situations are actually the small businesses who can't afford to open their doors. When a business can't afford to open its doors, do you know what happens? It actually employs no-one. That is a lose-lose situation for the business and for the employee who could otherwise have been employed.</span>

This coalition government have done a tremendous job delivering for the regional people across this country when it comes to those mobile phone black spots. Colleagues, how many dollars did Labor expend on mobile phones? Zero—not one cent. So we are very, very proud of the programs and decisions that I have made and, indeed, the government are making in relation to regional Australia and, when it comes to the Sky Muster mess that Labor left us, the decisions that the coalition government have made to fix that.

But it's a very sad day for the people of Australia when this might be the sixth question I've been asked in two days and not one of those questions has gone to anything that is anywhere near a priority for the Australian people. And what a sad day it is for the Australian people and what a sad indictment it is of the Labor Party that, given an opportunity in the national theatre to ask a question about something that is important for the Australian people, about something that is a priority for the Australian people, the Labor Party has chosen not to do it.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">South Australia</span>—<span class="HPS-MinisterialTitles">Minister for Education and Training</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">14:30</span>):  I thank the senator for his question on an issue of importance to Australian households and businesses and the Australian economy. It stands in stark contrast to every single question we have had from those opposite today, who are just interested in playing political games. Well, they can play their political games, but the Turnbull government will get on with ensuring that electricity prices are brought down as far as possible for Australian households and businesses. We know that electricity prices have a real impact on cost-of-living pressures for Australian households. We know they have a real impact on the competitiveness of Australian businesses. That's why we're taking action that will drive down prices and improve affordability for millions of Australian households.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The result of the work done by the Prime Minister and Mr Frydenberg with energy retailers over recent weeks will see more than two million Australian households clearly advised of the way in which they can access cheaper electricity in the future. This will mean cheaper bills for households, which will improve their cost-of-living circumstances. These reforms will not just be the initial steps of the retailers committing through two different ways of communication with their customers to offer those cheaper rates and prices and ensure people understand. They will also ensure that market rules, ACCC rules and ongoing communications with consumers will empower them to make decisions that guarantee that their prices will be lower in the future.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">These are issues that are of genuine importance to the Australian people. These are issues that matter in terms of their cost-of-living pressures, their household budgets and the viability of their businesses. Those opposite may not care. They might want to run political games in here. But nothing will distract the Turnbull government from its focus on helping people to get ahead and mange their cost of living.</span>

Well, that was news! It was news, of course, because here in the Senate we see what Labor do and not just what they say. We saw that earlier this year Labor voted with Greens senators on a motion that said coal 'has no long-term future in Australia'. That sounded like a cosy Labor-Greens deal. Late last year, Labor co-sponsored a Senate inquiry with the Greens, with the ambition to 'encourage the retirement of coal-fired power stations'—another cosy Labor-Greens policy deal.

Your government has approved and continues to approve the use of transvaginal mesh devices in Australian women when this device has permanently disabled women, in the worst medical scandal in this country since thalidomide. I have met women in wheelchairs and on crutches. Our Senate inquiry has revealed that Centrelink has refused these women, these innocent victims, disability pensions. Will the government instruct DHS to recognise mesh related injuries as a disability for the purpose of receiving a disability pension?</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Victoria</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">14:37</span>):  What level of qualification do your DSP assessors need to have to determine someone's eligibility for a disability pension in this case? Are they psychologists, doctors or social workers or are they unqualified novices, because one of the victims has told our office that they were 'like' a psychologist?</span>

Prior to 2015 the government made a number of changes to assessment processes, which included independent medical panels selected by government as opposed to an individual's general practitioner or other medical professional. That is one aspect of it. But I'm very happy to provide further details of that on notice as well.</span>

Last week, in Darwin, I announced the local industry capability plan initiative, which is intended to strengthen the opportunity for local businesses, particularly throughout rural and regional Australia, to maximise their involvement in defence estate and infrastructure projects. In relatively small communities I know even modest levels of defence spending can provide tangible economic benefits, whether they are to be seen in increased skills, jobs or economic sustainability.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">It is also the case that using local businesses near defence bases, facilities or training areas simply makes sense and, frankly, provides value for money. So Defence will be piloting a local industry capability requirement as part of the request for tender for three upcoming major facilities projects: the $230 million explosive ordnance logistics reform, which covers 12 defence sites across Australia; the $135 million Shoalwater Bay training area redevelopment; and the $24 million Townsville field training area mid-term refresh. They all go to market in the next few months.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">There will be an additional requirement on tenderers bidding. It will take the form of a specific schedule in a request for tender. It will require tenderers to clearly state how they have engaged with local industry in providing their proposed response and detail how local industry will be involved in delivering the work packages that underpin the project. The successful tenderers' local industry capability commitments will be a deliverable at contract signature, and contractors will be required to provide regular reporting of their achievements. This is a very important initiative for local businesses across Australia, particularly in rural and regional areas, where there is significant opportunity related to growth in defence estate and infrastructure. </span>

The initiative will also give local businesses in Central and North Queensland a useful opportunity to showcase their capability in the lead-up to the Australian-Singapore military training initiative, which is also going to prioritise the use of local industry as recorded in the memorandum of understanding that was signed between both the Australian and Singaporean governments. </span>

The initiative was well worked through in discussions with local industry representatives, particularly in the Northern Territory, and elsewhere. Masters Builders Northern Territory has described it as 'an important step in making sure that local businesses have a real opportunity to tender for work in the rollout of the nearly $8 billion in defence infrastructure over the next decade.' Similarly, the Civil Contractors Federation NT has said that small-to-medium civil construction companies will be the major beneficiaries of this new approach. The Capricorn Coast Business Alliance in Central Queensland has also backed the initiative, as has Nicole Manison, the Deputy Chief Minister of the Northern Territory, who welcomed the plan and its focus on local business. Unlike many others—particularly, if I might say, those opposite, who neglected defence infrastructure and investment—we are actually committed to ensuring that regional communities benefit from this commitment and that defence capability benefits from this commitment as well. <span style="font-style:italic;">(Time expired)</span></span>

Our government has implemented 31 out of the 51 north Australia white paper recommendations, and the remainder are well underway. Out of the $500 million National Water Infrastructure Development Fund, $40.5 million has actually been allocated to 16 programs that are currently being assessed. We have the $5 billion NAIF, which is going to be able to provide funds and a real injection into the economy by partnering the private sector with the various state governments and the Commonwealth to ensure that we provide concessional loans to major projects. </span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">That NAIF pipeline is going very well. There are 57 active inquiries. Five are up to the due diligence stage, and there are 16 at the assessment stage. We know that infrastructure is absolutely essential to deliver outcomes. We've got the best prices we've ever had in the cattle industry. We are just recovering from the political decisions of those opposite. We are going really well in the market, but you need to connect opportunities with the market—and what we need to connect opportunities are, of course, roads. That's what we have to build. We have got $700 million in roads—$300 million to Queensland, and $200 million each to the Northern Territory government and Western Australia. This is an absolutely fantastic investment.

It was a very exciting meeting. They focused on beef, the aquaculture sector, horticulture—all those opportunities the north provides. Importantly, from my portfolio, Indigenous leaders actually had a seat at the table for the first time with their ministerial colleagues. This partnership is going to provide really serious outcomes not only for Indigenous Australians and the say that they have in this country but particularly for the north. Peter Yu said that this was a historic day and that never before had there been such engagement at such a senior level on this matter of national importance. Our government will continue to engage and deliver for northern Australia.</span>

He had found a mango hopper and he was delighted to tell me the news that we are building a new biosecurity laboratory in Darwin. So, when he finds these new creatures that are a threat to the north, instead of having to go all the way down south, the level of amenity provided by this laboratory will enable the identification of this pest, particularly, but also pathogens and diseases that are going to threaten the north. Again, our investment in the ranger groups is a huge amount of funds but, most importantly, 2,500 individuals, many of whom are across the north, are looking after the biosecurity of Australia and ensuring we can protect the north. <span style="font-style:italic;">(Time expired)</span></span>

Those on the other side want to talk about citizenship. On this side, we want to talk about the future of regional Australia, about making sure that our children and our grandchildren want to go back to regional communities that are thriving and growing into the future. That's the thing that matters to the people I talk to out in the regions: making sure we have strong regional economies so that we can have the backbone driving this nation. Those on the other side want to talk about citizenship. Do you know what that does? It just throws up the fact that the Labor Party has absolutely no plan for regional Australia—absolutely nothing. On this side we're going to keep delivering. We're going to make sure that we do ensure the future of regional Australia. It is a very sad indictment on the Labor Party that question after question is about citizenship and not about the priorities for the Australian people. </span>

The answer is no. And I again take the opportunity to point out that those opposite simply have nothing for regional Australia. They have had two days to come in here and ask me any number of questions about my portfolio areas. They could have asked me about mobile phone blackspot delivery. They could have asked me about the NBN. They could have asked me about the Building Better Regions Fund. They could have asked me about the new community investment stream that is going to be delivering brilliantly for communities out across the regions. They could have asked me about the $500 million the coalition is going to deliver for regional projects. They could have asked me about the effects test. They could have asked me about strengthening competition laws. They could have asked me about country-of-origin labelling. But they asked me about none of those things, because they have no plan for regional Australia and nothing to offer regional people.</span>

I'm pleased to tell the Senate that, indeed, the Turnbull government's reforms to higher education are about providing a more student-centred approach in terms of higher education, providing students with more choice, more information and a more relevant experience. Our reform proposals include expansion of sub-bachelor places, associate degree opportunities and the chance to take more relevant, work-linked, industry-linked, shorter programs that are still—to differentiate them from VET—clearly articulated into other higher degree pathways; equally, allowing students to decide where they should take their postgraduate subsidies to ensure that, rather than old historical deals of postgraduate place allocations, we actually have a system where the most worthy students in the most appropriate disciplines choose the field in which they want to undertake their studies and the university that best fits them to do so.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Our reforms also expand for the very first time funding for work placements into university courses so that universities will have a direct incentive to help place their students in work-integrated learning environments to give them a more relevant work experience as part of their training. Overall, there are additional reforms in enhancing transparency of information around admissions and, indeed, measures to help hold universities accountable in the future for ongoing institutional improvements in student satisfaction, in teaching and graduate processes and in employment outcomes for their graduates—all of which are critical. And, yes, there are measures to ensure financial sustainability across the sector as well, a sector that has seen funding grow by 70 per cent since 2009 and which, under our reforms, will still see 23 per cent growth in funding over the next four years.</span>

Almost half of our universities are in the top 300 globally. They have collective surpluses of $1½ billion. They are indeed outstanding institutions that make an important contribution to our country. But they're also institutions, as I said before, that have seen enormous growth in taxpayer funding and support in recent years. Indeed, analysis shows that whilst they've seen per student growth in funding of around 15 per cent, the cost growth has only been around 9½ per cent. What we're asking universities to do as part of our reforms is to find some efficiencies, with a slightly slower trajectory of funding growth in the future—still some 23 per cent growth over the next four years, but a slightly slower trajectory of growth. Indeed, many, such as former vice-chancellor Steven Schwartz and former ANU professor Keith Houghton, have identified that there are real productivity opportunities in the university sector that can be deployed and can ensure they continue to succeed and excel within the budget framework. <span style="font-style:italic;">(Time expired)</span></span>

At the time, the Labor Party proposed an efficiency dividend on universities, only, when they lost that election, to backflip in relation to that policy. It wasn't just the efficiency dividend that the Labor Party proposed; they proposed some $6 billion worth of cuts and savings across the university sector. Now, of course, we see the hypocrisy of the Labor Party, who say no to the Turnbull government's more modest reforms and measures than they proposed. We all know that the best thing to do with Labor is to have a look at what they did and what they do—not at what they say or what they claim, because Mr Shorten's words certainly cannot be trusted. We know that, were they to win, the cuts would be back and the hypocrisy would be exposed. <span style="font-style:italic;">(Time expired)</span></span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">I want to acknowledge at the outset the senator's ongoing interest in the NBN and her participation in the committees of this Senate in relation to the NBN. I think it's fair to acknowledge that the NBN is one of the most scrutinised agencies in the parliament. The company and my department have appeared at nine separate hearings over the past 12 months, including supplementary budget estimates plus an additional spillover hearing; additional estimates plus an additional spillover hearing; budget estimates plus an additional spillover hearing; and several hearings of the Joint Standing Committee on the National Broadband Network. In addition, my department and agencies in total have spent in excess of 55 hours before committees for Senate estimates or the Joint Standing Committee on the National Broadband Network. I can advise the Senate that the total number of questions on notice raised in all estimates hearings over the past 12 months is 2,057. The total number of questions on notice answered in the last 12 months is 2,048 for the Senate estimates committee and 81 for the Joint Standing Committee on the NBN. </span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">Turning to the most recent budget estimates hearings, which relate to the senator's outstanding questions, I can advise colleagues the hearings were held over three days on 24 and 25 May and 15 June this year. Following these hearings a total of 417 questions on notice covering my portfolio were received. One question was withdrawn. Senator Urquhart has made reference to eight answers to questions on notice that remain outstanding. I can advise the Senate that in relation to the budget estimates process to which these questions on notice relate, key members of NBN's team attended the scheduled hearings. In addition to the five hours of testimony from the company on 25 May, the committee requested a subsequent spillover hearing, which was set down for 15 June. In the interim, 78 questions on notice were submitted to NBN specifically with a due date of 7 July. In the meantime NBN again appeared before the committee for a further two-hour spillover hearing on 15 June. Fifty-four of the 78 NBN-specific questions from the first estimates 2017 hearing were answered in advance of the set deadline and all 78 were responded to by 10 August. </span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">As a consequence of the spillover hearing of 15 June, at which the NBN and my department appeared, a further 84 questions on notice were submitted, with a due deadline of 28 July, and Senator Urquhart has placed a further five questions on notice following the aforementioned 84 questions, with a deadline of 24 August. I can advise the senator that, of the 333 questions on notice lodged following the May budget estimates hearing, 88 per cent were finalised within the deadline. I note that a second spillover hearing of the Senate estimates committee will be held on Thursday of next week, and we all eagerly anticipate that. I undertake to the senator that I will endeavour to ensure that the handful of remaining questions on notice related to the committee's inquiries will be answered as soon as possible prior to the next spillover hearing. </span>

I think the minister mentioned eight, but there are actually nine. He didn't mention what is so special about these final nine that there has been a delaying, delaying and delaying of the minister's response. It is completely unacceptable. </span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">It's bad enough that the Australian people struggle to get information on the NBN, and it's bad enough that they struggle to get basic internet connection from the NBN. Not only can they not get a proper connection; but they cannot get any advice or questions answered. We put detailed questions on one of the largest infrastructure projects in this country's history and I'm really concerned that we're faced with a government playing political games. We on the NBN committee hear all the time when we're out there talking to people that the only way to get a basic answer from NBN Co is to go to a politician or the media. That's what people on the streets are saying, that's what the media are reporting and that's what the talkback shows are all saying. We hear all the time that NBN Co will tell you the bare minimum of information, if anything, which is often nothing at all, unless you go to the media. It seems to whip up some sort of a frenzy when the complaints end up in the media and miraculously a solution is often found. A solution is often found for people who go to the media and raise issues about the NBN. Those who don't want to go public—a lot of people aren't confident about doing that; they don't want to be seen as complaining—get left behind in this process.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">The standing orders of the Senate clearly state that answers to questions on notice should be provided within 30 days. Everyone understands—I think we all do here—the workload of ministers and departments, but we haven't left it for 30 days; we've left it for longer. This has been a problem all year with Minister Fifield. Time and time again, it has been 60 to 70 days before we've received a response to questions on notice at all. It's a real concern. What it relates to is the transparency around NBN Co's operations and the clear politicisation of the rollout of the NBN by this government. </span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">In May this year, the night before the communications and arts budget estimates, the Senate Environment and Communications Legislation Committee distributed 108 responses to the questions on notice. Of those 108 responses, 107 related to the NBN Co. By the morning, when the Department of Communications and the Arts were due to appear, 17 questions relating to NBN Co were still outstanding. It's been over two months since those were placed on notice. At that stage, when we had the hearings, the then chair of the committee, Senator Reynolds, and I expressed our disappointment to the minister and to the secretary of the department about the lack of response and the time frame that it took to get that response. At the time, the secretary of the department gave us a commitment to double down their efforts next time. Well, the doubling down doesn't seem to have amounted to very much at all. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Of the questions placed on notice after the first spillover hearing in June, and a few weeks later in July, 58 were received only last week—weeks and weeks after they were due. As I've just told the minister, eight are still outstanding from the spillover and one is overdue from mid-July. There were also six answers to questions placed on notice in June where NBN Co have essentially said answering the question is too hard. Minister, what is it about these questions that is so hard to answer? What is it that you don't want the Australian people to know? After answering these questions, perhaps the minister could then provide the Senate information on when the office received the responses from the department. Was it at the same time as those questions answered last week?</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">If we look at the questions that remain unanswered, questions on notice 298 and 359 relate to the cost of the commissioned research. What is it that NBN Co and Minister Fifield don't want the Australian people to know? What is it they don't want them to know? Why is the cost of these reports so difficult to disclose? Across the two questions, I asked about the cost of research reports released over the past couple of years. This is a standard question that all sides of politics ask of government agencies and departments from time to time. It's nothing unusual. The people of Australia have a right to know what NBN Co is spending on research and the purpose of that research. I won't read the names of all 20 reports but some of interest to colleagues include <span style="font-style:italic;">The </span><span style="font-style:italic;">nbn</span><span style="font-style:italic;"> GranTechie Report</span>, where a new wave of silver surfers are closing the generational gap; the <span style="font-style:italic;">nbn</span><span style="font-style:italic;"> Silver Economy Report</span><span style="font-style:italic;">,</span> which revealed that the silver economy is set to boom; the <span style="font-style:italic;">nbn D</span><span style="font-style:italic;">igital Parenting Report</span><span style="font-style:italic;">,</span> where we found out that school is back and parents are embracing the future; and the <span style="font-style:italic;">nbn</span><span style="font-style:italic;"> Digital Dream Report</span>, where Australians' top life goals were revealed once and for all. The front page of this report has a woman with a huge smile holding a golf club in an alleyway and wearing a T-shirt emblazoned with 'Keep calm and carpe diem'. The <span style="font-style:italic;">Aussie app-etite: connected devices building the future home</span> report revealed that homes in Australia will have three times the number of connected devices in 2020. What a revelation! On sport, NBN Co commissioned the <span style="font-style:italic;">nbn</span><span style="font-style:italic;"> Future of Sport Report</span><span style="font-style:italic;">,</span> where it was revealed that the lines between sport and entertainment have blurred beyond recognition. This is just a sample of some of the research reports that NBN Co has conducted to market their product to consumers. That's fine, but let's be transparent about it—and why won't they release the costs of these reports?</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">NBN Co has a fixed pool of funds to conduct its activities and roll out the network. Surely a dollar spent on these reports is one dollar less that can be spent on rolling out fibre. Are these reports really worth it? We don't know because we don't know what the cost is. Some, no doubt, are worth it, but the only response to recent questions on notice about research reports that I've received was to question on notice 356. In this question I asked:</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">The lifestylepreneur report revealed that Launceston in Tasmania is one of the nation's top entrepreneurial hotspots. It is interesting that the media release associated with the report didn't mention once—not once!—that Launceston is the first city in the country where gigabyte services are being offered. Not once did it mention that. The release didn't mention that fibre to the premises has been rolled out to nearly all of Launceston. NBN Co's response about the cost of this report was:</span>

We can't find out from the minister; we can't find out from NBN. It's a payment for a report. That's what it is. And, if this is the response to this research question, why have questions on notice 298 and 359 not been answered?

                <span class="HPS-Normal">While I'm talking about Tasmania, I'll move to question on notice 365, which is also outstanding. Question 365 sought information about the new node that NBN Co is installing at the Burnie hospital on the North West Coast. NBN Co has declared the area ready for service, but when the cardiology clinic attempted to connect to the NBN it was discovered that the node servicing the consulting rooms at the Burnie hospital was 1.7 kilometres down the road. After the issue was taken to the media and a question was asked of Minister Fifield in question time, NBN Co then—not before, but then—provided some assistance to the clinic. They decided that they would install a new node 500 metres from the front door. So the question is: why 500 metres? They won't tell us. They won't disclose why. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">My question on notice 365 sought a basic range of information about this new node, and it was in six parts. They are: how many premises are to be serviced by the new node? What is the longest distance from the new node to a premises to be serviced by that node? What is the average distance from the new node for premises to be serviced by that node? What is the difference in cost between a revised FTTN service and a new FTTP service for the Burnie hospital site? What is the difference in cost between a revised FTTN service and a new FTTP service for the other premises to be serviced by the new node? And what is the difference in reliability of a fibre-to-the-premises connection and a fibre-to-the-node connection at 400 or 500 metres from the Burnie hospital site? </span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The thing with this new node is that the clinic required basic upload speeds of 10 megabits per second. The Turnbull NBN only has a minimum expected upload speed of five megabits per second. Despite going to the effort of building a new node, NBN Co were unable to guarantee the basic upload speed that was required by this clinic to enable them to do their work. And so it came that the clinic found a different fibre provider that could guarantee a basic upload speed that would enable the clinic to connect to its main server in Launceston. Launceston is the city I mentioned earlier where fibre to the premises is everywhere. NBN Co commissioned lifestyle reports about its benefits. </span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">It's interesting that NBN Co are now silent on question on notice 365. My question is: is it embarrassed by the situation? What will it do now with this node, how many premises will be serviced by it and how reliable will their service actually be? It's also interesting that NBN Co has answered question on notice 364, which was lodged at the same time as question 365. In this response, NBN Co revealed that the node near the Burnie hospital is the first node in the country set for installation in an area that has been declared ready for service. NBN Co explained that it is rare to deploy a node or a micronode into an area that is already ready for service. No doubt. Countless others across the country will be very interested to hear that NBN Co is now, on occasion, going to install new nodes where the distance from a current node is too great. I suggest that those with deep concerns and a strong case go to the media, because we know NBN Co is listening. </span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">Given the unreliability of a fibre-to-the-node service, in a response to a question from Senator O'Neill NBN Co revealed that six per cent of fibre-to-the-node consumers cannot achieve download speeds of 25 megabits per second and 35 per cent cannot achieve 50 megabits per second. So it's no wonder the clinic had to go to a private provider to get the service they needed. </span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">Question on notice 342 asked about the costs of a fibre-to-the-node rollout. NBN Co were asked four very simple questions relating to the construction of the nodes, connection of power to the nodes, active electronics within the nodes and connection of fibre backhaul to the nodes. These are basic questions about the component costs of building fibre to the node. So why is the government sitting on this information? Is it because they're embarrassed by fibre to the node? We all remember that the Minister for Regional Communications, Senator Nash, has referred previously to fibre to the node as the 19th century solution. Or is it that the costs are more than they budgeted? Is that what it is? Unless they answer, all we can do is speculate. We have no idea. So the government need to reveal these costs. The minister needs to do that. </span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">I want to move away from fibre to the node. Question 328 asked for a simple state-by-state breakdown of the deployment of fibre-to-the-curb technology. Fibre to the curb is NBN's new golden child, with one million premises set to receive fibre all the way to the pit on the nature strip. NBN Co pushing fibre deeper into the network improves reliability, improves upgradability and improves speed. It costs slightly more but it will deliver a better product for customers and will require less maintenance and less work to upgrade it in the future. Of course, FTTC is not Labor's preferred option. We have always wanted a fibre-to-the-premises rollout. But, after the efforts of Prime Minister Turnbull and Minister Fifield, the Australian people just want the best that they can get. Like everything under the government's multimix technology mess, it's completely luck of the draw as to what your community will be allocated. Question 328 was a simple question. NBN Co did not provide an answer to this question. But, wow, talk about an unsatisfactory response! The response included a broken link to NBN Co's website and it said that it was too hard to add up the premises by state. How is it too hard? NBN Co have this information at their fingertips. Is it too hard, or is it simply that they do not want to provide it? After all, it will show that Tasmania is set for zero premises under fibre to the curb.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">Despite the rollout on the west coast presenting a perfect opportunity, construction on the west coast's fibre-to-the-node rollout has not commenced, and the response to question on notice 368, part 2, confirms delays in the ready-for-service date of around three months, from the middle of next year to the second half of next year. It is such a debacle that the responses to parts 1(a) and 1(b) of the question demonstrate that NBN Co either don't know or won't disclose whether the detailed design work is complete for this region. In just the past few months, since the announcement in June this year, I've been asking numerous questions of NBN Co, including: will the west coast of Tasmania also be included in the fibre-to-the-curb rollout? For months I have had nonanswers from NBN Co and a request that I lodge the questions through the estimates process. Fine! That's what I did. And I still get an ambiguous response.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Last week, after the response to question on notice 368 was received, my colleague the member for Braddon, Justine Keay, and I issued a statement to the Tasmanian press calling on the Prime Minister to direct NBN Co to clear up this ambiguity and roll out FTTC in Queenstown, Rosebery and Zeehan on the west coast. These communities were slated to have fibre to the premises under the original NBN, and then Prime Minister Turnbull, as communications minister, broke his promise to complete the fibre-to-the-premises rollout in Tasmania and turfed these west coast communities onto satellite. But, after a concerted community campaign, Labor promised to roll out fibre to the premises to these communities, and those opposite promised to roll out fibre to the node in Queenstown, Rosebery and Zeehan through the NBN Co's Technology Choice Program. The minister should really go and check the weather on the west coast this week: rain, rain, snow, rain. What does copper hate? Rain. The copper on the west coast is already significantly degraded. The region is one of the wettest in the country, yet they want to replace copper with new copper. It is ridiculous!</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">Do you know what else is ridiculous? During Ms Keay's radio interview last Thursday, the NBN Co's Corporate Affairs Manager for Tasmania, Russell Kelly, tweeted that the west coast would receive a fibre-to-the-node rollout. There was no explanation and no further information. He subsequently went on radio and said that there were no delays and construction would start soon. That evening I emailed Mr Kelly with some basic questions, in particular how a change from a mid-2018 ready-for-service date to a second half of 2018 ready-for-service date is not actually a delay. Guess what? I haven't had a response.</span>

I could sum up this whole saga by saying it's easy to tweet, as we saw from Mr Kelly in Tasmania the other day, but it's obviously very, very hard for the government to explain to us and the people we represent. We need to get their answers to actually be able to go back to those people and talk to them about the issues they've got with NBN Co. NBN Co is not being transparent, and neither is the government, in the delivery of NBN. <span style="font-style:italic;">(Time expired)</span></span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Queensland</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">15:29</span>):  Another stunt by the Labor Party, because we happen to be on broadcast today. We've just had a 20-minute adjournment speech on a matter where a senator hopes to get a headline in her local media over these issues, which, in fact, if you know about NBN Co, all stem from the mess NBN Co was when Labor senator Conroy designed it on the back of an envelope in an aircraft. The whole difficulty which this government has been trying to deal with is the fact that Senator Conroy and the Labor Party could not organise a chook raffle, let alone Australia's biggest ever business.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I congratulate Minister Fifield on the answer he gave to Senator Urquhart's question. This session of the Senate is supposed to be about finding out why questions on notice have not been not answered. Senator Fifield was given some notice an hour or so beforehand, and in that hour he was able to come up with accurate details of the huge number of usually irrelevant questions asked by Labor senators at estimates, on notice and otherwise that involve the department, Commonwealth bureaucrats, in hundreds of hours of research, trying to find the answers, which, I will bet you, Madam Deputy President, the Labor senators who ask the questions never even read. That is obvious, because you go to the next estimates and they ask exactly the same questions, and the public servants say, rather embarrassingly, 'I'm sorry, Senator; we already answered that on notice, in writing.' Senator Fifield gave us statistics. Most of the questions have been answered.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I am still waiting for answers to a couple of questions that I asked of the Rudd-Gillard-Rudd government, which finished four years ago. I put questions at estimates two years before that, and I am still waiting for the answers from Labor ministers. That was par for the course when the Labor Party was in government. But I congratulate Senator Fifield on getting so many of the answers and explaining that those that had not been able to be addressed by public servants because of the time taken would be answered very shortly.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Could I suggest to Senator Urquhart—if she is not just after a cheap headline in the local rag—that she does what I do now and what I used to do even in the term of the Labor government. If I have a serious question, a serious wish to help a constituent, I will go and approach the minister. I have done that a number of times with Minister Fifield. Different constituents have had problems that I thought his office might be able to deal with, and so I've gone to see him in his office. He is very, very helpful. If you have a serious question about the Burnie hospital, if it's a serious question, if it's something that requires immediate attention, don't try and get a cheap headline in the local rag; go and see the minister's office, and see if they can give some help.</span>

Why NBN, as a government owned organisation, would need a government relations manager, no-one could ever tell me.

                  </a>  Again, for Senator O'Neill's benefit, the motion is that the Senate take note of Senator Fifield's answer, which was answering questions on NBN. I have said to you, 'Go and ask Mike Kaiser if you want to know about the NBN,' because he was the $400,000-plus government relations manager for NBN when NBN got us into the mess that Mr Turnbull and Senator Fifield are now trying to resolve. </span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">I don't want to delay this debate any further. I am not going to speak for 20 minutes on what is clearly an adjournment topic. But some of the rubbish that is spoken here, particularly on broadcast day, needs to be challenged, because the misinformation that is given out about these issues has to be corrected. That is why I have taken a little time to congratulate Senator Fifield on his response to the questions that were asked, highlighting again the abject waste of taxpayers' money in paying highly skilled public servants to answer literally hundreds and hundreds of questions on notice that those opposite don't even read. I say that because they come to the next estimates, they ask the same questions and the public servant embarrassedly says, 'I'm sorry, Senator—we've given the answer to that to you before.' That shows that most Labor senators never read any of the answers to those literally hundreds and hundreds of questions that are placed on notice.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I make the point again because there are taxpayers who are listening to this debate, and those taxpayers pay these highly skilled, highly paid public servants to go around and answer all of these hundreds and hundreds of questions that are never looked at by Labor senators. It is just an abject waste of taxpayers' money that these questions should be asked and the answers never read. Senator Fifield indicated that most of the hundreds of questions that have been asked have been answered. There are a few that have not been answered, and he gave the reasons for that. He indicated that, at the very earliest time, they will be answered.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I again say to Labor senators: if you're serious about helping people like at the Burnie hospital, don't go to your local paper and get a headline; go and talk to the minister's office. If you're seriously trying to fix a problem, go and talk to the minister's office. I know you'll be well served. But if you just want to play politics—if you think that is a cheap way of getting Mr Bill Shorten as Prime Minister of Australia—at least be honest about what you're doing and don't clothe it in these questions about technical matters that you'll never even read or understand the answers to.</span>

                  <a href="140651" type="MemberSpeech">
                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Senator O'NEILL</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">New South Wales</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">15:41</span>):  Listen to the last couple of words—'technical matters that you'll never read or understand'. If we wanted language to symbolise the smug superiority of this government with regard to this rollout of NBN, we just got it from Senator Macdonald. That's probably the only decent contribution that he's made because it reveals absolute contempt for the Australian people, for our businesses, for health, for education and for all those innovators around the country who are begging for the opportunity to grow businesses and jobs, to educate at distance and to absolutely transform our economy. They've been sold down the river by this government who thought that we were too stupid and were going to stay stupid long enough to be unable to figure out what a dud it's selling us.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The lemon NBN that the government are delivering us—fibre to the node—is breaking down all over this country. They thought they'd get away with it, but the Australian people are onto them. We want to know the facts about what the government are doing, and that's why we've put all of those questions on the record—because the government have attempted to hide every single possible thing they can about this disastrous rollout.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I want to make some comments about Senator Fifield's opening remarks. We have, from this senator, this constant positioning of: 'Be calm. Don't worry about it—everything is fine. You shouldn't be concerned. Yes, we are spending $29 billion.' He forgets to tell you about the additional $20 billion that they had to put in on top of that because the market was awake to the rollout and understood how bad the rollout was, so the market wouldn't come in with the last $20 billion. So we've got $49 billion in a government business enterprise of which Senator Fifield is our representative.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We have asked questions. Yes, we have certainly asked questions. This is a massive spend—it's $49 billion. What we've got is Senator Fifield saying: 'It was a lot of questions. It seems to be an unreasonable number of questions.' How many questions do you reckon the Australian people should get for $49 billion? I reckon we should get a lot of questions, and we should also get some decent answers. What we are calling the government's attention to—and thank you, Senator Macdonald, for letting us know it's broadcasting day—and what we are letting the Australian people know is that the government are hiding what they're doing from you with regard to the NBN.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I want to put on the record a number that you should ring if you are experiencing trouble with getting the NBN connected at your place. Let me tell you that, in my situation, my husband and I were able to build an entire house and move in the time that it took to get the NBN connected to our old house. That's how bad the delays have been. I want you to take this number down if you're listening, or if you're here in the chamber or the gallery today, and you're concerned. The number is for the Telecommunications Industry Ombudsman, and it is 1800062058. I will repeat it before I finish my remarks this afternoon. People are sick and tired of getting this nonsense, this rubbish run-around, from this government. They're getting it from the NBN, they're getting it from their retail providers like Telstra, Optus and all of those companies that are providing the NBN around the country. People are sick and tired of being caught up in a blame game that goes from one person to another. They are also sick of what the technology is not delivering. They're sick of the continuous dropouts that are hurting their businesses. They're sick and tired of the impact on their families of not being able to get the access they have been promised. This government said the NBN that they were going to deliver would be cheaper. That's wrong. They said it would be faster than what people had. We're hearing right across the country that people want their ADSL back because their NBN connection is slow and fragile. They said it would be cheaper and faster and they said we would get it sooner. That is absolutely not the case. They are way behind and they have a massive problem going on with one part of the system that they rolled out, another kind of technology that clearly Senator Macdonald thinks we're all too stupid to understand, the HFC cable, which is the equivalent of a Foxtel line into peoples' homes, which the government said would be good enough for us to get information down. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We want to know some important things about what's going on with the NBN. Let me go to the substance of some of the questions. The first thing I would like to go to is service class zero. I'm sure there will be people listening to this debate somewhere around the country who cannot figure out why they can't get an answer out of the NBN or out of their telecommunications company, their retail service provider, about why they can't get the NBN. These are people who are often in a community where everyone else in their street has finally got connected—they're not happy, but they've got connected. But they're sitting there on their own at the end of a street, or sometimes in the middle of a street, and they simply cannot get a connection. NBN, when they hit these in-the-too-hard-basket cases, have this Orwellian term for it. They call it 'service class zero'. I suppose there is some truth in it, because you get zero response from the NBN, you get zero delivery of the NBN and you get zero explanation about why you can't get that connection at your house. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We did ask questions about service class zero. We asked for a breakdown by the technology, because they are rolling out fibre to the node, HFC, and there is talk they are going to roll out fibre to the kerb. We wanted to know, by technology, how many premises were in service class zero. We wanted to know that for households and businesses. We wanted to figure out what was going on. That is one of the questions we wanted an answer to. This issue is affecting thousands of Australians who can't get an answer. But this minister didn't go to any of the substance of the matter. He simply made the argument that there have been a lot of questions asked and they are working really hard and there is nothing to see here. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The problem is that Australians need access to a service. They want the real NBN, they want the fibre NBN and they are going to want it more and more as our use of technology increases. Those who are caught in the service class zero spiral are in a desperate need. This is why this is so egregious and why it is so wrong that some of these questions are not being answered. We know that the NBN produces a weekly report which contains the aggregate number of the service class zero premises. It's not like they don't have the information. Why won't the minister have that handed over and put into the public domain? We know that the information is there. It's at their fingertips. Why should it be that the Senate, asking questions on behalf of the Australian people, should be kept in the dark about information that is actually available on a weekly basis to the minister if he should ask for it from NBN, which he is in charge of? He's not separate from NBN; we have to remember that. The minister is responsible for the NBN. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Other questions that we asked included about the commissioning of research. There's nothing extraordinary about this question. This is the sort of question that's asked of government agencies all the time. We asked it because we believe that taxpayers have the right to know what NBN Co is spending on research and what the purpose of that research is. We know that some of the pieces of research conducted by NBN Co include <span style="font-style:italic;">The nbn GranTechie </span><span style="font-style:italic;">r</span><span style="font-style:italic;">eport</span>, the <span style="font-style:italic;">Future of </span><span style="font-style:italic;">s</span><span style="font-style:italic;">ports</span> report, the <span style="font-style:italic;">Gen nbn 2020 and beyond</span> report and <span style="font-style:italic;">The nbn </span><span style="font-style:italic;">d</span><span style="font-style:italic;">igital </span><span style="font-style:italic;">d</span><span style="font-style:italic;">ream report</span>. The Senate can be assured that the NBN has been anything but a digital dream in every possible way. But why has this government not been able to produce a response to this question on notice? Surely, having commissioned the research, the purpose of it must already be known. The cost of it must already be known. But it's not known in this chamber and it's not known to the Australian people, because this government is hiding as much as it possibly can about its failed delivery of the NBN.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We also asked for figures underpinning the 2016 corporate plan, which is the main document that gives us a sense of what is going on with the NBN. Often at those Senate estimates when Senator Urquhart and I are both there, with our colleague Senator Chisholm, asking these sorts of questions, we get referred: 'Just wait; the next corporate plan will be out.' It's as though all is going to be revealed—except it isn't; it never is, because strategic pieces of information are being kept from public view. We have a request in that the NBN provide the underlying ready-for-service assumptions that they've relied on in their 2019-20 financial year explanations or revelations in their corporate plan. We know that the government's tried to avoid answering this question and another question, question 176, from additional estimates. So, in the name of transparency, we've asked it again, and there's still no response.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">This is a pretty important question to get an answer to: what are the figures that the NBN is relying on for ready for service? That's part of their business plan. And is this business sustainable? Is it working? What assumptions are embedded in it? If you run a business you have to have those basic assumptions to understand what's going on with your business. Surely NBN Co, with $49 billion invested in it—taxpayers' dollars—should be able to answer the sorts of basic questions that a year 11 business class could answer regarding the assumptions that underpin NBN Co's financial plan. There are other questions that concern me that we haven't got answers to, including question 313—again, figures underpinning the corporate plan for 2019-20. Again, why can't we have those?</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Let me go then to fibre-to-the-node costs. I want to take the opportunity again, in case people who were listening didn't have a pen the last time I said it, to tell you the Telecommunications Industry Ombudsman's number again. If you're getting pushed from pillar to post, around and around, and you're sick of the NBN circle, you need to call the Telecommunications Industry Ombudsman and they will get on the case of your retail service provider. The number is 1800062058. Why am I giving you that instead of saying, 'Talk to the minister', as we heard from Senator Macdonald? It is because five million Australians can't all talk to the minister and, as we know, the minister doesn't answer questions anyway. Why aren't I telling you to go to your local member or senator? It is because our offices are already inundated with people calling on us, over and over, to try to help them solve problems. It has got to the scale now, with the rollout of this dodgy NBN, that even our offices can't keep pace with it. The Telecommunications Industry Ombudsman can force the companies to actually answer some of your questions and to do something within 10 days. So don't waste your time anymore. Don't let this government cost-shift its mismanagement of the NBN onto your business. Don't let that happen. Call the TIO on 1800062058 and get somebody to take some action on your behalf, because it's a pain for the retail service providers to actually be contacted by the TIO.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I know from people in the electorate who have spoken to me and from people who are working behind the scenes for telecom organisations, who are desperately worried about the practices they are being asked to enact, that they are being told: 'Do everything you can to prevent the complaint going to the TIO.' Why would that be the case? Because it costs them some money, it costs them pain and it puts a timetable on the responsible action. It also means this government can't continue to come in here and say, 'Everything is fine,' because they will actually have to report the TIO figures. The TIO is the only tool we have that is really effective right now to get a sense of how bad this NBN rollout is going. You should call the TIO and let them know so that this government can't continue to come in here and mild-manneredly say, 'Everything is okay,' because you know it's not okay, I know it's not okay and the government, deep down, know it's not okay. That is why they are hiding. That is why they're not answering these very important questions. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Question 357 is about NBN technology trials. The Turnbull government like to talk about how the NBN is trialling new technology. They do this in order to attempt, in Senator Macdonald's vein of 'They're too stupid to figure it out,' to distract Australians and the media from the fact that they are deploying a second-rate 19th century copper network. Senator Urquhart revealed the source of that comment, and that is Senator Nash. The government's own minister for regional affairs has indicated that she thinks the NBN technology that her government is rolling out is a 19th century technology. We don't always like the answers we get from Senator Nash, but, on that, she is telling the truth. We have asked the government to explain how much taxpayer money has been spent on trialling technologies that it hasn't deployed. How much has been spent on this grand experiment, cooked up by the now Prime Minister, Mr Turnbull, when he was the communications minister? How much has been spent? We are still waiting. No answer.  </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">One of the things that we asked about was the wholesale speed tier mix in the 2016 corporate plan. This is important, because we asked the NBN to provide the numerical data that was underlying an important graph contained in their own corporate plan. The government has tried to avoid this question by providing data from the 2017 corporate plan, instead of the 2016 corporate plan, but we will continue to pursue it. We have requested it again to get the facts and the details on the table. The response from the NBN Co is absolutely outrageous. The volume of detailed questions on notice and the limited time available to respond mean that the NBN must prioritise questions that are not answered in whole or in part in regular reporting vehicles such as weekly updates, the corporate plan, annual reports, quarterly financial reports or on their website. This is simply ridiculous. The NBN Co is a government business enterprise accountable to the minister, who should be acting on behalf of the Australian people. They should be called to account. They should be writing full and fearless answers, giving the facts, keeping proper scrutiny on this $49 billion spend that is underway. What type of a racket is this government trying to run? It is the equivalent of the NBN waving a white flag and saying, 'This is all just too hard.' The company that is tasked with the wholesale provision and rollout of the NBN right across this nation is saying to us that it is simply too hard to answer our questions. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We have asked a question about a simple breakdown of where they are going to do fibre-to-the-curb, which is a new technology that the government have decided that they are considering deploying. We simply asked: where are they going to do it? We can't get an answer from the NBN. They have got to have this information at their fingertips but they are arbitrarily determining that they have a right to the information but the Australian people, through the Senate, do not. That is absolutely unacceptable. It cannot continue to be the case. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">In the last couple of minutes that remain, I would like to indicate that the folder that I have brought in here—which I could go through—is just of the first hundred people we have documented who have problems with the rollout of the NBN on the Central Coast. Recently we had a hearing on the Central Coast, and I was very disturbed by stories of the kind that I have told you here this afternoon of people waiting for service, people unable to get information and people whose service had fallen over. But I want to make some points about this government, which pretends to be the friend of small business. Let me tell you: in Gosford we have a perfect example, in a small part of the seat of Robertson, of where the real NBN has occurred. We took evidence from a company there that received multiple international awards, whose business is entirely in the cloud and is employing 20-plus employees in a great little office in Gosford and delivering world-class, award-winning technologies to councils and other major organisations all around the world. They've got the real NBN. That's what is happening for them. NIB, the insurance group, brought their call centre to the middle of Gosford, in Robertson, because it has the real NBN.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Around the edges of it, though, in the second part of the testimony that we heard, we heard from local small businesses who own gyms or who are art creators and sellers of their own art. One gentleman, whose NBN connection was delayed by four months, lost $70,000 because he could not get any internet connection to sell his artworks online in the lead-up to the Christmas period. That is just one small business. We heard about alarm calls in a 24-hour gym on the Central Coast, where for weeks and weeks and weeks on end the owner was there trying to resolve the problem. It took him months to get a response. We heard story after story of people who were getting the run-around. Labor is listening to the people of Australia. We know you're getting the run-around from the NBN and the RSPs, and this government is trying to give the Senate the run-around. We will not stand for it. That is why the government must answer these questions. <span style="font-style:italic;">(Time expired)</span></span>

              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Small">That the Senate take note of the answers given by the Minister for Regional Development (Senator Nash) to questions without notice asked by Opposition senators today relating to her status as a senator and as a minister.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">I started question time yesterday asking Senator Nash a question in relation to whether or not she has the right to still sit in cabinet and make decisions when there are questions over her citizenship. Yesterday she tried to lecture us in relation to respect for Australians. Today I ask the minister: when is she going to show respect to the Australian people? We know what the political objective is and why she is still in cabinet. That is clearly to protect Mr Barnaby Joyce, in the other place, and also to protect the Prime Minister and his government because they have such a slim majority in the House of Representatives. What it also clearly established is that we have a Prime Minister who is too weak. He is not a strong leader, as he tries to tell us. He is very weak because he won't deal with this issue.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Senator Nash was asked a series of questions by senators Bilyk, Collins, Pratt, Kitching and O'Neill. She was not able to—or wouldn't, actually—answer any of those questions. One of the questions which is fundamentally important to the Australian people is: from whom did she seek her advice that she is relying on to be able to sit in cabinet and make decisions? When was she given that advice? We haven't asked for her to table that advice, but we have a right to know. When did she seek that advice, and who was that advice sought from? We have advice from some of the best legal minds in this country that says there is a clear doubt as to whether or not Senator Nash is eligible to sit in cabinet. We have clear advice that Mr Barnaby Joyce is ineligible to sit in the other place. When Senator Nash was trying to deflect these questions, she referred to the important work that she has done for regional Australia. But what she didn't say, and what she refused to answer, was anything about the $1.7 billion budget she oversees as a cabinet minister. Of those grants that she is able to make throughout Australia, how many will be challenged if she is found to be ineligible to sit in the chamber?</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">These are serious questions, and the Australian people deserve answers. It is not just about who she's giving those grants to; it is about whether those who have applied for these grants and are rejected then challenge her right to make decisions if she's deemed to be ineligible to sit in this place?</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">There is a huge grey cloud—in fact, it's a black cloud—hanging over this government. They are seen for what they are. The government are governed by a Prime Minister who is weak and indecisive. We have a government that is led by someone who does not even have control of his own caucus. He promised at the last election that he would have an innovative, agile, adult government. When, Mr Prime Minister, are you going to bring that government to town? Quite clearly, the way these issues with Senator Nash and Mr Barnaby Joyce have been dealt with has not given any confidence to the Australian people. Others in this place who have questions hanging over their citizenship and their eligibility under the Constitution have stepped aside from the cabinet. Senator Canavan has stepped aside, because he knew that morally it was the right thing to do. The cloud is clearly over Senator Nash. She's not a very effective minister anyway, and you'd have to be pretty desperate to be propped up, as she was this afternoon, by the likes of Senator O'Sullivan—somebody who has a very dark cloud over him as to whether he's entitled to be here, because his family companies have gained financially from the Commonwealth government, which make him ineligible to sit in this place. We have a minister who is still sitting in the cabinet and who should go to the backbench but is failing to do so, and we have a Prime Minister who is so weak and so beholden to others that he won't deal with this issue. <span style="font-style:italic;">(Time expired)</span></span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Western Australia</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">16:07</span>):  After listening to these questions to Minister Nash over the last two days, I'm not only embarrassed as a senator but also ashamed as a woman to see a conga line of women over the other side, as if somehow the fact that only women are asking Minister Nash these questions makes what they've done okay. It is not okay. For two days in Senate question time, when we should have been talking about energy prices, national security, North Korea and jobs in regional Australia, they have persisted with these disgraceful questions. I have never been as proud of any of my Senate colleagues as I have been of Senator Nash in the last two days in the way she answered these questions from the female senators over the other side of this chamber. She was graceful, she was calm and she was very clear in her answers to the same questions over and over again. She could not have been any clearer. I heard what she said in this place on 17 August, and I've read what the Attorney-General said on 18 August. To keep coming in here asking her these same questions is nothing short of disgraceful, particularly when you know she is entitled to be the minister, to make the decisions and to get on with the job for regional Australia in the way that she is.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">Those opposite keep asking the same questions over and over again. If they missed Senator Nash's comments in the chamber on 17 August and haven't bothered to go back and read the transcript of what she said or the very detailed explanation the Attorney-General gave to a committee the following day, I will now answer the questions, as Senator Nash has over and over again, and provide the detail that those opposite have been seeking. They have asked about the time line and about the evidence. Senator Brandis said:</span>

                <span class="HPS-Small">… by Wednesday we had identified a suitable English QC who was an expert in UK citizenship law and who was available to advise the government urgently.

                <span class="HPS-Normal">It goes through exactly who said what and did what, what advice was sought and what advice was received. The advice from Dr Donaghue, the Solicitor-General, was received at the Attorney-General's office at 'approximately 5 pm last night', which was the Thursday night. Senator Brandis said: 'The Prime Minister dropped into my office at 6.15 pm on the Thursday to discuss the matter' and they immediately called the governance committee of cabinet to review the matter, straightaway, on Thursday night.

                <span class="HPS-Small">The governance committee resolved that the matter should be referred to the Court of Disputed Returns under section 376 of the Commonwealth Electoral Act. The Prime Minister asked Senator Nash to come and see him. She arrived a few minutes later.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Small">We decided, between 6.30 and 6.50, roughly, that Senator Nash should go into the Senate immediately to tell the parliament and the public what the position was.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">
                  <a href="121628" type="MemberSpeech">
                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Senator McALLISTER</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">New South Wales</span>—<span class="HPS-MinisterialTitles">Deputy Opposition Whip in the Senate</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">16:12</span>):  I note that almost nothing provided in the contribution from Senator Reynolds deals with the questions being asked today in the chamber. Senator Reynolds has outlined the steps that Senator Nash took to clarify her citizenship status by seeking legal advice, but the questions we asked today were not about that. The questions we asked today sought to understand the basis of Senator Nash's decision to retain her position as a minister and to continue to exercise her functions as a minister. I am extremely surprised at the cavalier way Senator Nash brushed off those questions, because other people don't think they are trivial. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">George Williams, as everybody understands, dean of law, acknowledged constitutional expert, gave an address last week to the National Press Club and explained the problem in quite a bit of detail. He advised that the wisest course for ministers Nash and Joyce would be to refrain from making decisions, or to step down pending the outcome of the High Court hearing. He said:</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Small">This was because their authority to run their departments and to make decisions under legislation depends upon the law regarding them as being properly appointed. Section 64 of the constitution says that 'no minister of state shall hold office for a longer period than three months unless he is or becomes a senator or a member of the House of Representatives'.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Small">If current ministers are ruled in breach of section 44, they will have made many decisions without apparent legal support from when the three-month period of grace ran out late last year. This would be especially problematic from the point at which they and members of the public became aware they were in jeopardy of being disqualified. Decisions from this point on, including any about contentious matters such as Adani's Carmichael coal mine in Queensland, might be challenged in the courts.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">It is that issue we are seeking to explore with Senator Nash today, and it is that issue she comprehensively avoided in every answer she provided. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">She maintains she is not required to disclose legal advice. That may or may not be so, but she was not asked to do that. She was asked by Senator Collins: 'Who sought the advice, and when and from whom was the advice received?' and, 'How have decision-making processes been varied as a result of that advice?' She refused to answer any of those questions of process. These are ordinary questions of process which are routinely answered in this chamber and in the committees of the Senate. Her refusal to answer speaks to absolute contempt for this chamber and also for the public, who have a right to understand the basis on which she continues to exercise her functions. If advice has been sought then the minister ought to provide the details we have requested: who provided it, when and who requested it?</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I want to observe also that Senator Nash has used very precise language in describing her own decisions since referring herself to the High Court. On at least three occasions, she has told the Senate that she is entirely confident her decisions are 'well considered and appropriate'. It's nice that she is willing to give herself a pat on the back, but that doesn't answer the question that's at stake. Senator Wong's point of order today made it pretty clear. She asked if the decisions were 'beyond challenge'. My question yesterday to Senator Nash was very clear: 'On what basis can she assure us that her decisions will be valid?' The question isn't whether these are smart decisions—whether they are considered and appropriate. The question is: are they validly made? This is a question on which Senator Nash has provided no assurance.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The National Party is working at the very boundaries of acceptable constitutional and parliamentary practice. Serious doubts have been raised about the validity of ministerial decisions taken if ministers are indeed ineligible for election. Any serious party of government would have an answer to those questions and would take those questions seriously. But this is not a priority for the National Party. Their principal concern is to protect their guy: Deputy PM Barnaby Joyce. Their concern is to protect the National Party position in the 12th Senate spot in New South Wales, and they are willing to do that through overlooking serious concerns about the eligibility of their parliamentarians to sit as ministers. They provide no assurance for the residents of Geelong, none for the residents of Wide Bay, none for the general public, and it is unacceptable. <span style="font-style:italic;">(Time expired)</span></span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">
                  <a href="HLL" type="MemberSpeech">
                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Senator BUSHBY</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Tasmania</span>—<span class="HPS-MinisterialTitles">Chief Government Whip in the Senate</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">16:17</span>):  I rise here today and ask the question: why don't those opposite care about regional Australia? They asked question after question today of the minister responsible for regional Australia, but did they ask her about issues that impacted on regional Australia? No, they did not. They focused on issues purely to score political points. I ask: why do they not care about Australians? They had an hour of question time to ask any minister a question about matters of importance to Australians. They could have asked questions about the economy. They could have asked questions about energy prices, which are going up drastically right across the country, largely as a result of policies put in place by the former federal government and also by state Labor governments right across the country. They could have asked questions about security, about issues very pertinent to what's going on in the world, such as the security threats that are impacting on people right across the world—Australians who are overseas and also Australians at home. There are real risks. But did they take the opportunity during that hour to ask questions about security? No.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">On a related topic, did they ask questions about defence? The world currently faces one of the most serious threats to international peace since the Cuban missile crisis in the early sixties, but did they ask questions about what was going on in the Korean Peninsula? No. They chose to ask purely political questions of Minister Nash. Did they ask questions about jobs in regional Australia, or about things that matter to Australians: jobs and the ability to put food on their table, put a roof over their heads and warm their families? No. They chose to ask purely political questions. They asked questions about things that, to use a legal term, are a mere spes. Unless and until the High Court decides that the senators and members of the House are ineligible to sit in their respective places—and the circumstances of each are different—this is just pure speculation.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">It's important to also note that the government has strong advice that suggests, particularly in the case of Senator Nash but also others, that they have a strong case and that it is likely the High Court will find otherwise than that they are ineligible. This issue, until such questions have been decided by the High Court, is a moot one. There's no point standing up and arguing the issue in this place because, until and unless the High Court decides something that has an impact of the sort they are talking about, there is no way that the questions can be answered. The opposition and the others can speculate all they like but, until such time, this is mere speculation.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The opposition, during question time and whilst taking note, have referred to the questions that they would like answered. All those questions can and will be answered when the High Court makes its decisions. Senator McAllister says that she wants answers to those questions but, as I say, these questions are merely being asked to stir the pot. They are pure politics. They are being used to beat up Minister Nash, who is undoubtedly one of the most capable and competent ministers in her area that this country has seen for at least 10 years, and, by extension, to beat up the government. Neither Senator McAllister nor Senator Polley talked about anything of relevance to Australians or about what Australians would like to hear their members talk about—matters that matter to them. Rather, the question time performance and the performance by Senator McAllister and Senator Polley was a disgraceful attack on a highly competent, capable female senator. They clearly haven't looked at the facts as presented by Senator Nash and also Senator Brandis.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">It's a shame that, at a time when the opposition could be asking questions about these matters, they persist with this type of petty politicking. The matter has been referred to the High Court, and that was the appropriate thing to do. Senator Nash has been, from day one, completely open and transparent about her citizenship status, including requesting that she be referred to the High Court. It's a shame that those opposite refuse to adhere to the same level of honesty and transparency across the board of their caucus. As was outlined in Senator Nash's statement to the Senate on 17 August, she advised the Senate of her status upon receiving advice from the Solicitor-General. She wanted to put those facts on the record as quickly as possible, which she did.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">
                  <a href="39801" type="MemberSpeech">
                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Senator CHISHOLM</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Queensland</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">16:22</span>):  What we see is an extraordinary response from those opposite. They care so little about regional Australia that they're happy to have an illegitimate minister overseeing decisions that are going to have an impact on that community. It's incumbent on those of us on this side to raise those questions because we care so much about regional Australia. We want to see the so-called money that they are going to spend on regional jobs packages which they promised more than a year ago and still haven't spent. But if they finally do spend it over the next couple of months then it will be called into question. So, absolutely, it is the right thing for us to question Minister Nash, because there is a cloud hanging over her decision-making.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The other thing that's remarkable from Senator Reynolds's contribution is the timeline. They're not the luckiest government I've ever seen, but how lucky was that timeline! They find out on the Monday that they had an issue, and then it just happened that they concluded, through their legal advice, that it was a legitimate problem five minutes before the Senate shut down on the Thursday. It was very fortuitous, indeed, that they were able to quickly scramble in here and make an announcement! Of course, the honourable thing to do as soon as they knew on the Monday would have been to announce they had a problem, say they were seeking advice and stand down Senator Nash. The one thing that Senator Nash couldn't answer—Senator Reynolds didn't touch it and Senator Bushby didn't touch it—is: what is the difference between why Senator Canavan has stood down but Senator Nash hasn't? Not one of them went near it, and that is the key question that they have not answered. Senator Canavan did the right thing where we see Senator Nash refusing to do so.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I'm almost starting to feel a little bit sorry for Senator Nash—just a little bit—because it is pretty clear that she knows she is doing the wrong thing, but she knows she has to provide the protection racket for the Deputy Prime Minister in the other place. What a farce we're going to have in a couple of days when he is the Acting Prime Minister. What an absolute farce! They try and talk about all the important issues facing the country. Well, this guy is going to be the Acting Prime Minister, with that cloud hanging over him, later this week. What could be more important than that? It is absolutely important that we highlight it.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">For the last two days, we have asked questions of Senator Nash about her role, and we've had to do that because, as I said, she came in here five minutes before the Senate shut down to make her announcement about her dual citizenship. She has not faced the media since then. The only time we've had an opportunity to ask her questions started yesterday and continued today, and haven't the answers been unsatisfactory? I'll go to those now. What is the difference between Senator Canavan and Senator Nash? They have not given a coherent response on that. Why is the minister refusing to meet the standard set by her colleague Senator Canavan? There are questions about the ability of the minister to make decisions that are going to hold and cannot be challenged.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We've heard the expert advice from Professor Williams with regard to that, which Senator McAllister touched on, but it seems that this minister is determined to hang on despite this cloud hanging over her head. We also know that this is about providing a protection racket for the Deputy Prime Minister, Barnaby Joyce. You get the impression that Senator Nash understands how important and serious this issue is, but you can't help but conclude that that is their motivation. Senator Canavan stood down many weeks ago now, but this was too close to the issues surrounding Barnaby Joyce, the Deputy Prime Minister, so Senator Nash was unable to do so.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">What does it go to at the heart of this government? Yes, there's dysfunction and chaos, and you see that no matter where you go. I know that, in my travels through Mackay and Bundaberg over the last two weeks, I have received the response a lot that people are in open ridicule of this government. The government know that there is chaos and dysfunction at the heart of what they are doing and the decisions they are making, but the consequences for Australian families are real. We know about the jobs packages from Senator Nash. Are they actually going to make decisions that are going to have a benefit for local people in terms of gaining employment? We now have the illegitimate Deputy Prime Minister in charge of the Northern Australia Infrastructure Fund. They haven't made a decision so far. Are they going to be bold enough to do it with a cloud hanging over his head? We also know that they have gone nowhere on energy policies. So, yes, there is chaos and dysfunction, but the cloud and the questions that are hanging over this government actually have serious consequences for the Australian people. It's a sad and tawdry situation that the government have found themselves in and, again, it's the Australian people who are losing out.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Tasmania</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">16:27</span>):  I move:</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Small">That the Senate take note of the answer given by the Minister for Employment (Senator Cash) to a question without notice asked by Senator McKim today relating to asylum seekers on Manus Island.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We didn't get much out of Senator Cash, and that's, I suspect, very strongly because there's actually not much to be had out of Minister Dutton with regard to his intentions for the over 800 people who Australia is responsible for and who we have currently imprisoned on Manus Island and at Port Moresby in Papua New Guinea. It's clear, from the responses that we did get from Minister Cash today, that Minister Dutton has completely lost control of his cruel, inhumane and torturous policies. One thing we did get from Minister Cash is that, in just 57 short days, it is still Minister Dutton's intention to close the Manus Island prison camp that Australia has been funding and operating using Australian taxpayers' money for well over four years now.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The question before Mr Dutton, and the one that Minister Cash did not respond to today, is: what is going to happen to the over 800 people—the overwhelming majority of whom have been found to be genuine refugees—once that camp closes? What we do know is that the Papua New Guinea government, through its Attorney-General, Mr Steven, has said very clearly that the closure date of 31 October was not mutually agreed upon between the Australian government and the Papua New Guinean government. We also know through Mr Steven, the PNG Attorney-General, that the Papua New Guinea government is 'not going to allow' a situation where Australia withdraws and leaves behind the over 800 political prisoners of Australia in Papua New Guinea. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">One thing we did find out from Minister Cash was that, in secret, Minister Dutton visited Papua New Guinea last Friday to meet with the Papua New Guinea Prime Minister, Mr O'Neill. He secretly went over there without notifying the Australian media and without notifying the Australian people, and had a conversation with Mr O'Neill, the contents of which still remain secret as I stand here today. The question that Mr Dutton and his representatives in the Senate need to answer—Mr Dutton having scurried over in secret to Port Moresby on Friday with his tail between his legs—is: what exactly was agreed, if anything, at that meeting between Mr Dutton and Prime Minister O'Neill? Was there any further financial consideration offered by Australia or accepted by the Papua New Guinea government at that meeting? Crucially, has Papua New Guinea agreed to accept the over 800 political prisoners of Australia on Manus Island and agreed to support them, to the best of their capacity, once the Manus Island prison has been closed by Peter Dutton? </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">This incompetent, heartless and cruel minister has some serious questions to answer, but I don't think he has the answers. He is basically just crossing his fingers and making it up as he goes along in this portfolio. In doing so, he is playing Russian roulette with the lives of over 800 people—people who stretched out a hand to Australia for help, people who the Labor and Liberal parties in this place have kicked in the teeth repeatedly. How telling it is that many of these people are now too scared to come out of their prison on Manus Island—a place where they have been murdered, assaulted, tortured and at shot at by the Papua New Guinean navy. Their prison is now the least unsafe place they know in that country. What a disgrace this is—what we are doing to these poor people. What has become of our country, where their rights can be trampled and their freedoms and liberties denied, yet in this place the Labor and Liberal parties collude to implement misery on them?</span>

                <span class="HPS-Small">The Education Services for Overseas Students (TPS Levies) Amendment Bill and the Education Services for Overseas Students Amendment Bill will amend the <span style="font-style:italic;">Education Services for Overseas Students (TPS Levies) Act 2012 </span>(TPS Levies Act) and the <span style="font-style:italic;">Education Services for Overseas Students Act 2000 </span>to enable the Minister for Education and Training to reduce the administrative and base fee components of the Tuition Protection Service (TPS) levy paid by Commonwealth registered international education providers by legislative instrument.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Small">The reserves in the Overseas Students Tuition Fund (the Fund) have been growing faster than expected due to sustained growth in overseas student enrolments, which has not been offset by a similar proportion of claims on the Fund. The Fund is expected to meet its upper reserve target of $50 million (set by the TPS Advisory Board) within the next two years.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Small">The TPS Director has already reduced the risk rated premium in order to slow the growth of the Fund. Further reductions to the risk rated premium are not a feasible mechanism to slow the growth in levy collections because a price signal needs to be maintained for higher risk providers. It is preferable to give the Government flexibility to manage the Fund, by providing the Minister a mechanism, by legislative instrument, to adjust the settings to the administrative and base fees to reward the international education sector overall for years of stability and growth, and allow providers to redirect funds for other purposes.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Small">The TPS Advisory Board and the Australian Government Actuary (AGA) have indicated the desirability of a reduction in the administrative and base fees. This will ensure the Fund remains within the target range of $30 million to $50 million recommended by the AGA and endorsed by the TPS Advisory Board. The reduction will not affect protections for international students or Australia's reputation for high quality education, as there will be sufficient reserves in the Fund to meet claims each year and in case of any unforeseen events or major provider closures.</span>

              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Small">Passage of the bills in the 2017 Spring sittings is necessary so that the Minister can meet the 31 December 2017 deadline for making an instrument under the TPS Levies Act to reduce the levy in time for the 2018 levy collection.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Small">If these amendments are not passed in the 2017 Spring sittings, it is unlikely the instrument could be made by the Minister in time for the 2018 levy collection. This would mean another year of no relief for low risk providers including universities, TAFEs and government schools, and rapid growth of the Overseas Students Tuition Fund will continue.</span>

The first products to have standards applied will be outdoor equipment and marine outboards that contribute to poor air quality in urban areas. Standards for other product emission sources will be considered in line with future government priorities for action on air pollutants. This measure supports the National Clean Air Agreement and the cities agenda.</span>

In December 2016 the Australian Government announced that from 1 July 2018 all small petrol engines brought into the Australian market must be certified as meeting the standards. Passage in the 2017 Spring sittings will allow Rules to be made in late 2017, which will provide the industry enough time to ensure the products they are importing are compliant by 1 July 2018.</span>

                  </a>  Mr President, it was indeed your political party, the Liberal Party, that banned whaling in Australia under the previous Prime Minister, Malcolm Turnbull, and since that time all cetaceans, whales and dolphins in Australian waters and in the Australian whale sanctuary in the Southern Ocean have been protected under Australian law. I would like to acknowledge today the brave conservationists and activists from around the world who have joined Sea Shepherd, gone to the Southern Ocean and literally stopped thousands of whales being killed by illegal Japanese whaling—every Christmas, while we spend time with our families and go on holidays,</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">This motion today recognises the fact that Sea Shepherd has spent 13 years in the Southern Ocean protecting whales. They have been very successful in that campaign. Sadly, they no longer will be conducting a Southern Ocean campaign, and this calls on the Liberal government to enact its election promise and send a customs vessel to the Southern Ocean this summer.</span>

                  </a>  The Victorian government deserves praise for launching a royal commission into domestic violence. Fiona Richardson, as minister, was there right through the inquiry and out the other side to implement those findings. She was determined to eliminate inequality in women's lives and workplaces. The Greens thank her for her hard work and commitment on this crucial cause. Her own direct experience with family violence, explored in the most intimate and confronting way by <span style="font-style:italic;">Australian Story</span> last year and rebroadcast last week, informed and drove her groundbreaking work in this area. She has changed the course of history for many Victorian families and communities for decades to come. We owe her our gratitude for those lives she will inevitably have saved. She died before her time and well before her work was done. The onus is now on every one of us to carry on this legacy and fight for a fairer, safer world for women across the country.</span>

The business mentioned in this motion was recently removed from the program immediately following allegations regarding breaches of their conditions, and the Department of Employment is conducting an audit of participating employers. The PaTH program contains stringent safeguards. All internships are voluntary and must be agreed between the employer and the intern. To be eligible to host an internship, a business must have a reasonable prospect of employment for the intern. If the intern is dissatisfied, they can leave at any time during the internship without penalty.</span>

In fact, those who preach tolerance the loudest and demand tolerance the loudest are often the singularly most intolerant individuals, and we have seen that in this debate. Dr Pansy Lai has been victimised, she has been vilified and she has been bullied, most inappropriately. There is a counter-petition going on which has more signatures than the original one with its racist vilification of Dr Pansy Lai. I move:</span>

GetUp!, the organisation, were not calling for the deregistration of Dr Lai, and in fact the petition calling for that has now been removed from the CommunityRun petition site. This is not an issue of free speech. The calls for Dr Lai's deregistration weren't, as alleged by Senator Bernardi, for exercising her right to free speech, but out of deep concern regarding her seeming support for discredited, dangerous and ineffective gay conversion therapy. We as the Greens do not support the call for Dr Lai's deregistration; however, we do unequivocally oppose gay conversion therapy. Memo to Senator Bernardi: LGBTQI people exist, we're going to continue to exist, we cannot be converted and we deserve to have our rights treated as equal under the law. </span>

The whole-of-government task force within the Department of the Prime Minister and Cabinet will ensure appropriate actions continue, including consideration of any additional support for local communities that may be required. Defence has provided over $4 million to Hunter Water to connect properties in Williamtown to town water, and this work is underway.

                  </a>  Labor has consistently led from the front on the PFAS contamination issue. The Williamtown community has its own champion, the member for Paterson, who is fighting hard for the people of Williamtown and is working with the defence minister and the PFAS task force. The Turnbull government has said it is working on a solution for residents of Williamtown and surrounds, and Labor calls on the minister responsible for the PFAS task force to release the details of the solution without further delay. This is why Labor must oppose the motion as it is presented. The Turnbull government adopted many of Labor's PFAS policies from the 2016 federal election, including the establishment of the PFAS task force. The task force has been investigating community concerns regarding property valuation and is developing a policy solution for affected communities. Labor shares the anger and frustration of residents and calls on the PFAS task force to announce its PFAS solution as soon as possible to provide some certainty for affected communities, including Williamtown.</span>

                  </a>  Dangerous toxic contamination continues to pour out of the Williamtown base. The defence department has taken total responsibility for this severe contamination. Now we hear that Labor and the coalition will not be supporting what is really a very measured motion. All we are asking is for the task force to release the information for the federal government to investigate the design of a voluntary buyout scheme. It's a way to work through solutions for people who are at their wit's end because of the lack of action. Let's remember that in 2015 this Senate signed off on the investigation into what was happening at Williamtown. We came forward with some very solid recommendations. The chain is still being dragged. Now Labor is kicking it into the long grass. That's no way to treat these people.</span>

                    </a>  The government's position on this issue has not changed. We oppose the motion. The calling into question of a senator's eligibility to sit in this place is a very serious step, and that step should only be taken in cases where there is a clear case to answer. The motion seeks to turn this long-accepted principle on its head, effectively calling into question every senators' position until he or she is able to provide conclusive proof of their citizenship status. That would constitute a wrong-headed reversal of the onus of proof, especially given the undoubted public interest in certainty as to the composition of the parliament. Further, another referral would only add to the existing workloads of Senate committees and, in particular, the committee secretariats.</span>

                    </a>  Senator McGrath is absolutely correct. The calling into question of a member of parliament's eligibility to stand is a very serious issue. Perhaps someone should have told Tony Abbott that yesterday when he stood up with proof of his own citizenship and called on the Leader of the Opposition to demonstrate that he, in fact, was not a dual citizen. Senator McGrath's comment that we need to think very carefully before we call into question the eligibility of members of parliament is something we should take seriously. It's a shame that members of the coalition don't follow their own advice. The reality here is that we have put this motion up time and time again because we will be here again and again with further referrals to the High Court because we have not conducted a full and comprehensive audit of everybody's eligibility to stand in this parliament. The crossbench support it. It is time that Liberal and Labor do too. </span>

                  </a>  The coalition government do not support enhancing people's ability to take illegal drugs. The majority of the matters raised in the motion are primarily the remit of the states and territories. The government's position on these matters is consistent with the principles set out in Australia's National Drug Strategy, which encourages all governments to support people to recover from substance-use dependence and to reintegrate with the community. A drug-testing service is not part of our commitment to tackling drug use. Our balanced approach is based on evidence and incorporates prevention, early intervention and healthcare strategies, as well as law enforcement. The government do not support making illegal drugs more accessible. We do not support ceasing the use of sniffer dogs. In July, the government announced an investment of over $16 million to deliver the national rollout of real-time prescription monitoring for medicines to directly address the needless loss of life from misuse of these drugs.</span>

                  </a>  Labor has a proud record of minimising the harms that come from drugs. For example, it was the Hawke Labor government that established the national Needle and Syringe Program. In the decade to 2010 alone, the NSP is estimated to have prevented over 30,000 cases of HIV and around 100,000 cases of hepatitis C. But policies in this complex and sensitive area should not be made by stunt motions on the floor of the Senate. Several of the recommendations in this motion also require careful coordination between the Commonwealth and states. So, while Labor recognise International Overdose Awareness Day, we will not be supporting this motion.</span>

                  </a>  It is a great tragedy that we are now seeing more accidental drug deaths than we are seeing people die on the roads. In fact, the number of accidental drug deaths is now more than double the road toll, with Aboriginal people tragically overrepresented. We are now seeing more people die from prescription opiates than we are seeing people die from heroin. We need to recognise that the war on drugs is not a war on drugs; it's a war on people. It's time we started treating this as a health issue, not simply a law-and-order issue. We need to remove the criminal penalties associated with individuals who use drugs and make sure that they see a doctor, not a policeman or a judge, because they have a health issue. We need to ensure that we expand the role of harm reduction with needle and syringe exchange programs in prisons, with drug testing at festivals, by removing sniffer dogs, which cause more deaths than they save people, and by ensuring that we have real-time prescription monitoring for pharmaceutical opiates. We need to change what we are doing.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">
                  <a href="244247" type="MemberSpeech">
                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Senator KETTER</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Queensland</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">17:28</span>):  I rise to speak on this matter of public importance, the need for the Turnbull government to provide economic leadership to make the tax system fairer, fix the budget in a fair way and address housing affordability. Australians look to their federal government to provide the economic leadership needed to address our current challenges, yet we see the Turnbull government letting Australians down. Whether it's budget management, energy policy, penalty rates or housing, we see a government with its priorities in all the wrong places.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I will address each of the three elements of the MPI. When it comes to making the tax system fairer, when it comes to the priorities of the government, it can't be clearer that their budget proposal to increase the Medicare levy is misguided. They claim it is to fully fund the NDIS but, let's be clear, when Labor was last in government it fully funded the NDIS. To be even clearer, a future Shorten Labor government will continue to fund the NDIS.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">When it comes to the levy increase, it is dumbfounding that at a time of low wages growth, high cost-of-living pressures and the government already presiding over a cut in penalty rates for low- and middle-income workers the Treasurer is prioritising an income tax hike for those same workers. Mr Turnbull's tax increase means that a worker on $55,000 a year would pay $275 extra a year in tax, while someone on $80,000 would face an extra $400 in tax. A worker earning $85,000 a year would lose the full benefit of last year's 'sandwich and milkshake' tax cut and actually end up paying more in income tax. When it comes to multinationals paying tax, we see a government failing to take strong action to make the system fairer.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">It's not fair on everyday Australians or on proper taxpaying companies that other companies can use sharp business practices to evade their proper share of tax. I have been looking into this matter in the Economics References Committee's corporate tax avoidance inquiry. Of the $4 billion in liabilities raised by the ATO, which the government loves to talk about, we see that it's actually Labor legislation that is being applied—legislation that the coalition voted against. There's more to do in terms of closing loopholes and increasing transparency, and I call on the Turnbull government to adopt Labor's multinationals tax policies to make the system fairer.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I also want to briefly mention the recent announcement by Labor to make sensible reforms to discretionary trusts. It shouldn't be the case that there is a two-tier tax system—one for ordinary Australians and a business class tax system that lets you minimise your obligations if you have a high income. There should be one system, one that's fair for everyone. A 30 per cent minimum tax rate on discretionary trust income splitting is a sensible move to make the tax system fairer.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">When it comes to fixing the budget, let's also be clear: Labor understands that there is a need to fix the budget, not just over the forward estimates but over the medium term as well. In this term of parliament Labor has been very constructive when it comes to fair budget repair. Whether it was the measures in the omnibus bill or measures such as the bank levy, Labor has scrutinised the Turnbull government but worked constructively to repair the budget. You can also see from Labor's tax policies that we are strengthening the budget in the medium term. Negative gearing, capital gains tax and discretionary trust reforms all strengthen the budget in the medium term. And we're looking further ahead than are the government, who seem fixed on trying to make the numbers look good just over the forward estimates—when they're not preoccupied with themselves. When it comes to budget repair, priorities don't get much bigger than the company tax cut. It's now a $65 billion—not $50 billion—ramraid on the budget at a time when there could be more productive investments in areas such as infrastructure and education. When it comes to budget repair, you can't trust this government. Only this side of the chamber has a credible plan to properly repair the budget in a way that's fair and in a way that aligns with our values and priorities.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I will now turn to the very important matter of housing affordability. This issue just seems to be worsening, yet the government seems to be doing little on this matter. Even in recent times the Committee for Economic Development of Australia has raised concerns that affordability issues might persist for as long as 40 years. A survey by law firm Slater and Gordon found that 26 per cent of 16- to 24-year-olds need to rely on an inheritance from their parents before they can buy a home. Home ownership is getting out of reach. The HILDA survey shows that for couples with dependent children home ownership fell from 55.5 per cent in 2002 to 38.6 per cent in 2014. Home ownership rates have also collapsed for under-40s, from 35.7 per cent in 2002 to 25.2 per cent in 2014.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We also see the links between housing affordability and inequality. Again, the HILDA survey found that among men aged 18 to 39 homeowners earn $87,182 whereas non-homeowners earn $41,832. The reason young people aren't renting is not alleged lifestyle choices; they are being locked out of the market. And what do we see from the Turnbull government? We see a threadbare housing affordability policy announcement in the budget. We still haven't seen the legislation, and it's now September. The Treasurer does not seem to see it as a priority, yet Australians are entitled to information so that they can make an informed decision about whether to access it or not. The super scheme will do nothing to address housing affordability but will instead work to undermine Australia's world-class superannuation system, and Labor will not support it.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Labor has sensible policies to address housing affordability, including negative gearing and capital gains tax reform. That's well known. There are also other policies that the shadow Treasurer has announced, such as prohibiting direct borrowing by self-managed superannuation funds, the introduction of a uniform vacant property tax across all major cities, an increase of foreign investor fees and penalties, the establishment of a bond aggregator to increase investment in affordable housing, boosting homelessness support for vulnerable Australians and, importantly, getting better reform through housing agreements with the states. It's a comprehensive suite of policies that can meet the challenges Australians currently face.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">When we're talking about tax, I can't miss the opportunity to once again bust the mythology that those opposite have that theirs is the party of low taxes and responsible spending. I am indebted to the research done by Stephen Koukoulas, who shone a spotlight on this matter. He showed that eight of the 10 years since 1980 with the highest level of tax-to-GDP ratio have been under coalition governments, and all 10 of the 10 years with the lowest tax-to-GDP ratio have been under Labor governments. That busts the mythology about those opposite being the party of low taxes. When it comes to responsible spending, the IMF working group busted that myth as well and showed that profligate spending occurred on two occasions under John Howard. In conclusion, the Turnbull government has let Australians down when it comes to— <span style="font-style:italic;">(Time expired)</span></span>

I am very pleased that Senator Gallagher has submitted this motion to the chamber because it gives me the chance to inform you of all the wonderful things that the Turnbull coalition government is delivering in taxation, budget repair and housing affordability. Senator Gallagher would like the chamber to consider:</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Small">The need for the Turnbull Government to provide economic leadership to make the tax system fairer, fix the budget in a fair way and address housing affordability.</span>
              </p>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">I would be delighted to do so.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Senator Gallagher's motion has a number of parts, and I'd like to address each one of those in turn. Firstly, the senator brings up the alleged need for a fairer tax system. 'Fairer'—goodness me, that word comes up in this chamber an awful lot. I can hardly be the only one in here who is sick to death of the opportunism and insincerity coming out of Mr Shorten's Labor Party, centred on fairness and inequality. I apologise for my repetition, because repetition it is. It seems that, every time I rise to my feet, we are speaking on the same thing. I feel an enormous sense of deja vu when I once again call out this rhetoric for exactly what it is. It is a shroud for a radical redistributive agenda. As successive statistics repeatedly have proven, inequality is in fact falling in this country, not rising. Any claims to the contrary just don't stack up. Populist catchcries, however, are clearly on the rise.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The Australian Labor Party, under Mr Bill Shorten, is forgoing sensible economic policy for the base politics of envy and class warfare. History has condemned socialism for the economic nonsense that it is, yet Mr Shorten's Labor wishes to pursue it nonetheless. The Australian people, however, are smarter than that. Make no mistake: Labor's tax plan will freeze productivity, freeze economic growth, limit jobs growth and hold back wages growth. Mr Shorten should know better. As the recipient of a very high-quality Victorian education, one would imagine he would be well aware that a nation cannot tax its way to prosperity. Enterprise and hard work both need to be rewarded, not penalised, if we're to realise economic and wage growth for all Australians. It is indeed galling in the extreme that Senator Gallagher would blindly follow her leader into the empty rhetoric of redistribution and socialism. It is perhaps the case that voters in Ecuador might appreciate such political sensibilities but not here. Australians are smarter than that—so much smarter than that. Australians know that high taxes do not increase their wages. Labor's tax winter will penalise Australian families and whack small businesses. Quite simply, the worst thing that could happen for Australia's future economic prosperity is the election of a Shorten-led Labor government.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Senator Gallagher also called on this chamber to consider the need for the Turnbull government to fix the budget. The hypocrisy of those opposite on this issue is appalling. While in government, the Australian Labor Party were more than happy to rob future generations of Australians by running up enormous debt with unsustainable levels of expenditure. Now, in opposition, they block sensible measures to return the budget to surplus. Where the incoming Labor Party government under Rudd inherited a budget surplus from their predecessor, this government inherited baked-in spending and a structural deficit. It is patently ludicrous for any member of the Labor Party to attempt to use a matter of public importance to lecture the coalition on budget repair.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The Turnbull coalition government is acting to curb the insidious growth of federal government expenditure by passing the omnibus savings bills and providing substantial budget savings in the areas of education, social security and many more. While we can agree that more can be done and more must be done to finally return the budget to surplus and pay down the debt we inherited from the previous Labor government, we on the government side are doing everything within our power to do so while those opposite politically obfuscate to block measures that would have saved billions of dollars to the budget bottom line. How rich it is that Senator Gallagher and her colleagues would lecture those of us on this side of the chamber on the need to pay down debt. It is simply extraordinary.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Finally, Senator Gallagher has called on the government to address housing affordability. I'm not entirely sure where those opposite have been, because it gives me great pleasure to inform the chamber that much is being done by this government right now to address housing affordability. This is a government that recognises that housing affordability is a vital issue for many millions of Australians, and we are seeking to address it where we can, how we can and when we can. Very recently, crown land in the great city of Maribyrnong, Mr Bill Shorten's own seat, was released, which will enable the construction of thousands of new homes. Indeed, in the other place, in this very sitting period, we will see the introduction of two measures spoken about in the budget that will combat housing unaffordability. The government will pass the first home buyers super scheme, announced by the Treasurer on budget night, which will allow individuals to make voluntary contributions of up to $15,000 per year and $30,000 in total to their superannuation account to purchase a first home. These concessional contributions are taxed at only 15 per cent and can be withdrawn along with attributed earnings to make a deposit on a home. For most people this will boost the savings they can put towards a deposit by at least 30 per cent compared to savings in a regular savings account. Additionally, the government will pass a measure which will allow people aged 65 and over to make an exempt non-concessional superannuation contribution of up to $300,000 after selling their main residence of the last 10 years. This increased flexibility to contribute proceeds to superannuation will reduce barriers of older Australians to downsize homes that no longer meet their demands and, importantly, help free up housing stock for younger, growing families. This is a government that wants to do all it can to fairly—and I use that word without empty rhetoric—assist younger Australians to get into the houses they need.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">It should be painfully apparent to those watching that the Turnbull government is providing the economic leadership in the fields of tax reform, budget repair and housing. <span style="font-style:italic;">(Time expired)</span></span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Tasmania</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">17:44</span>):  We can walk and chew gum. Here's the oil: we can actually make this society and economy fairer, we can help fix the housing affordability crisis and we can take some of the pressures out of the financial system by doing a few simple things. We could actually do it this week if the government had the guts to bring forward some decent legislation.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We talk about socialism, capitalism and everything in between. At the end of the day, it's ironic that what's causing the housing affordability crisis in this country—and inequality—is the market system itself, and the perversion of that market system by governments, successive Labor and Liberal governments, who have put in place investor subsidies and perverse incentives that allow investors to go into the market and get taxpayer deductions for buying real estate and building their wealth.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We know that investors are the problem in our housing market, especially in Sydney, Melbourne, Perth and Brisbane. They get tax deductions on their capital gains when they sell a property, which of course makes it more profitable for them. They get to claim, through negative gearing, expenses—especially interest expenses—against their rental income. We all know this. Both these policies were put in place a long time ago to help stimulate the real estate market, and of course the real estate industry loved that. Mostly older Australians who have built their nest eggs have been able to invest in property and do well out of it, thank you very much. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The HILDA Survey recently showed how stark the picture is in this country, where younger Australians and lower-income Australians are facing a housing affordability crisis. In some categories, their homeownership levels have fallen by over 30 per cent since the last five-year survey was done. That's how bad it's got in this country. But it's also about financial risks in the system. </span>

                  </a>  It's a shameless plug for a very serious issue. And my dog was involved with it as well! Just to get Senator Bernardi's interest in this particular debate, my dog was in the bath with me! This is an issue that the Greens have taken very seriously, every estimates. Let me go back to two years ago, when I took over the Greens Treasury portfolio and we put the issue to the Treasury secretary at the time: 'What are you doing about housing affordability? What's the holistic approach? What's the package?' It was directionless—aimless. This government, if it is doing anything now, has been dragged kicking and screaming to this issue by the Greens, and recently by Labor, who jumped on the bandwagon with negative gearing changes and, hopefully, also, capital gains tax concessions. It's simple: let's get rid of these investor subsidies that are allowing investors to outcompete first home owners in our heated markets, especially in Sydney and Melbourne. We know we can do that over time, we can grandfather it or we can go for a more radical approach of removing them immediately. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">You want to talk about other money that's sitting out there, Mr Acting Deputy President Sterle? There's your home state of Western Australia. We have recently heard about the WAxit debate from the secessionists in the Liberal Party there who want to form their own country. Good luck with that! They complain about GST revenue, but what about the $238 billion—I will say it again: $238 billion—in tax deductions that the wealthiest oil and gas companies in the world have been given through the petroleum resource rent tax deductions? Two hundred and thirty-eight billion dollars—that's money that we could use for schools and hospitals, for fairness in this country, and it could underwrite some really good economic policies. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">So there are plenty of places we could look to to raise revenue to help make Australia fairer, but we just need the political courage to do that. And it's actually not that hard. We've been campaigning on these issues now for many, many years—and I'm glad that the Labor Party have become more progressive in recent times. Whether you call them socialists or not doesn't bother me. If all of us in here are focused on getting good outcomes for the Australian people, on tackling inequality and on having a fairer country then I think that's a good thing and you're to be congratulated on it. <span style="font-style:italic;">(Time expired)</span></span>

Talking about dogs in the bubble bath, talking about having a beer in the bubble bath, probably wasn't your best move, Senator Whish-Wilson. But, anyway, that's up to you.

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The issue we saw reported today in <span style="font-style:italic;">The Australian</span> was Senator Ian Macdonald going to the coalition party room and complaining about the government's dire position in the opinion polls. What he said was: if the government are going so well with their economic policies, why are the polls so bad for the government? That is something that I think the government should actually try and think about. I can tell them why they are going so badly—because inequality is increasing. Anyone listening to Senator Hume would wonder what planet she lived on. She was in here saying that there is no inequality, that inequality is not getting worse; it is not a problem. You go to any shopping centre and people will tell you what they're complaining about. They're complaining about power prices. They're complaining about power prices because this mob, this rabble of a government, can't get their act together even to deal with the recommendations they got from the Finkel report. They put the Chief Scientist up and say, 'Tell us what to do?' Then they adopt every recommendation except the key recommendation, and that is to have a clean energy target that would put a price in place to make sure that people would invest in electricity generation in this country. We now hear them talking about rebuilding Liddell power station. I was a fitter at Liddell power station for over seven years. Even when I was there, which is a long time ago, trying to deal with some of the issues that were starting to appear then, after 10 years of operation, kept a lot of maintenance fitters pretty busy, a lot of boilermakers pretty busy. Now they're talking about extending the life of a power station that's nearly 50 years old. I don't know how the government can even contemplate being seen as economically viable by the community; they're just not.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Senator Hume said she was going to talk about all the wonderful things that the coalition were doing. Senator Macdonald has basically given the game away. Whatever they're doing isn't working. Senator Hume, whatever you're doing is not working. Inequality is increasing. Workers are doing it tough out there. People are having big problems trying to make ends meet. Fairness and inequality are something Labor have been talking about and dealing with ever since we were formed as a party. We hear all the rhetoric about envy and class warfare. It's not class warfare to say that everybody should get a fair go. It's not class warfare to say that workers' penalty rates should be protected. It's not class warfare to say that workers should be able to send their kids out to school with shoes on their feet and put food on the table when they come home from school. That's not class warfare.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">With the nonsense we've heard from this coalition, it's no wonder Senator Bernardi jumped ship. It's no wonder he got out, no wonder he said, 'I can't put up with these fools anymore.' True, isn't it? Yes, Senator Bernardi. Thanks for nodding. That is exactly what Senator Bernardi did. He knew this mob were going down the tube, he knew that they had absolutely no chance at the next election, so he said: 'I'll cut and run. I'll get out and I'll make sure I can get back in here.' There are a lot over on that other side who won't be back. Anyone listening to Senator Hume telling us that inequality is not a problem and everything is going great under the Turnbull government would know that it's an absolute farce from a rabble of a government that just can't put one foot in front of the other. Every time they make an announcement, they have to change it next time around. Do you remember Prime Minister Turnbull saying that he was going to bring in all of these great changes? His first economic issue was to put in a 15 per cent GST. Remember that? How long did that last? I think it lasted about six weeks and then he retreated as fast as he could. The next economic thing that was going to be put in place was the states being allowed to tax. Taxation powers would be given to the states. I think that lasted about two days. Then the next big economic approach that the government was going to take was put in a big tax cut—a $65 billion tax cut—including for the banks that Senator Williams had been complaining were ripping off workers, ripping off people, day in and day out. Give them $65 billion: $7 billion to the banks and the rest to multinational corporations. This is just a nonsense. No wonder the community can't see any hope in Malcolm Turnbull. No wonder the community won't change, even if he puts on a new leather jacket—not that one from the seventies. He could put on a new leather jacket and that would mean nothing. </span>

                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Senator WILLIAMS</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">New South Wales</span>—<span class="HPS-MinisterialTitles">Nationals Whip in the Senate</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">17:56</span>):  We talk about fairness, we talk about jobs and we talk about the cost of housing affordability and the budget. I have said it before and I will say it again: why are houses so expensive, especially in Sydney and Melbourne? It is the simple case of demand exceeding supply; it is as simple as that. What is the cost? The cost is the land. The land is the cost. When they pull down the old house—they pay $2 million for a little wooden house and then pull it down—they put up a $2 million home. Land is so scarce. Yet, what do we have in this country? What do we have more per capita than any other country on the planet? We have land. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We keep saying: move out to country areas. Where I live in the beautiful town of Inverell there is an ample supply of water. We never have water restrictions. It is very good value. I think it is still about a dollar for 1,000 litres. Use as much as you like. Even in a drought, we never have water restrictions. You can walk into Inverell and into many other country towns—there are nice country towns in New South Wales, as I imagine there are in every other state in Australia—and for $275,000 or $300,000 you can buy a three-bedroom brick veneer home on about a 600, 700 or 800 square metre block. That is not expensive. But the first thing people say is: 'Where are the jobs?' Where I live, we are lucky to have Bindaree Beef, a large abattoir, which employs 800 people. We have unemployment—we have too much unemployment; it's too high—but we can't get workers to work at the abattoirs. We have to bring them in from Brazil, the Philippines—you name it. The jobs are there. What I am saying is that, if I was a young fellow—and I only wish that I was 25 years old—who lived in a city and I had a basic job, I wasn't well educated, I didn't have a tertiary education, I wasn't a specialist and I had never had an apprenticeship—I wasn't a fitter and turner, a mechanic, a plumber or a tradie or in some other specialised field—I would move to a country area, because I know that if I go out there I will get a job. If I am prepared to work, I will get a job. I have never seen a situation yet where someone who tries and tries to get a job does not get a job. If you persist, try hard and have a good work ethic, you will always get a job. It mightn't be the best job, but it will be a job.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I am simply saying that we need to move more people out to country areas, and we are getting condemned for it. Barnaby Joyce moving the APVMA from Canberra to Armidale is making room in the city here. Housing is expensive in Canberra. I'm sure those of you who've bought houses here would be well aware of it. I haven't bought a house here. We're trying to make more room, yet we're getting condemned for doing exactly that.</span>

                  </a>  Exactly. The point I make is: we have plenty of land in this country; why don't we use some? I'm sure where Senator Dodson comes from there's stacks of land, heaps of room. Why we insist on stacking people into the cities, especially Sydney and Melbourne, is beyond me.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">I want to talk about fairness, equality and the cost of living. Electricity prices are too high. State and federal governments of all persuasions have made mistakes in this field for a long time. Coal is the cheapest way to generate electricity—there is no question about that. In a motion before the Senate earlier today, the Greens and the Labor Party voted against coal once again. I don't know how the CFMEU support this mob. You don't support their industries, yet they back you financially all the time. Those opposite say, 'We can't build coal-fired generation in Australia, because we're going to change the CO2 levels around the world; we're going to save the planet.' As I speak to you now, 621 units of coal-fired power generation are being constructed. A unit is one generator. If you go out to Liddell or Bayswater in the Hunter Valley, you'll see the four big cement cooling towers with the water vapour coming out of the top. They are four-unit power stations, and 621 units of coal-fired generation are being constructed around the world, as I speak—299 in China, to add to the 2,100 units they already have. Those extra 299 units will produce more CO2—670 million tonnes, in fact—than the whole of Australia produces. These are the additional coal-fired generators being produced in China. There are some 120 in India and even 34 in Vietnam. Australia has just 73 units of coal-fired generation. Are we building any more? Not as yet, but we're going to have to, because it's getting too expensive, and coal is the cheapest way to generate electricity. We know that labour costs are expensive in Australia compared to many other countries. If we want to remain competitive, electricity is one cost we need to keep down.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Speaking of equality, John Laws is a person I've listened to on radio for probably 40 years. In the shearing shed, on the tractor, in the sheep yards, my late father, Reg, my brother, Peter, and I would be drenching or jetting a mob of sheep, and we'd listen to John Laws. He said for years, 'You don't make the poor wealthy by making the wealthy poor.' How true that is! Someone has to have money to create jobs, to invest, to kick off the factories, to employ the people. That's what the wealthy people do. They don't just sit it in a bank and live on it forever; the people with money, a good business initiative and the interest to have a go are rewarded for their great work, smart thinking and investment. That's what the country is about. Making them poor will not create more jobs; it will create fewer jobs. That's why we've reduced tax for small business, to give small business a go to actually grow.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">This whole debate is about jobs. Let's look at the facts. Today's figures show that total employment rose by 27,900 in July to a record high of 12.2 million. We now have 12.2 million Australians working. In the past 12 months, 239,300 new jobs have been created, three times as many as in Labor's last year in government. Of those, 197,700 were full-time. Of the nearly 240,000 jobs created in the last 12 months, almost 200,000 were full-time. In the last seven months, full-time employment has increased by 153,200, the largest increase in full-time employment over the first seven months of a calendar year since 2008. Female employment has increased by 124,600 over the past 12 months, to a record of high of 5.677 million women now in the workforce. Isn't that great? Youth unemployment has fallen by 0.4 percentage points over the past 12 months. So the jobs are being created. The unemployment rate was 5.6 per cent, down from last month's revised figure of 5.7 per cent. The annual rate of employment growth of two per cent is well above the decade's average rate of 1.6 per cent. The jobs are being created—as I said, 240,000 in the past 12 months, three times as many as in Labor's last year in government. This debate put forward by Labor is about jobs. We have the record for the increase in jobs. The record's there and the facts are there to prove it. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">In winding up can I say that one good thing I am proud and pleased about is the free trade agreements we've made and how rural Australia is looking so positive. Even the grain prices are good, along with the cattle prices, the wool prices, the mutton prices and the lamb prices, and the cotton jobs are going well, and many others. Jobs are available in regional areas. If you can't afford to buy a house in the city, move out to a country town. Put your head down—you'll get a job, you'll do well for yourself and you'll be most welcome and will fit into those country communities.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">South Australia</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">18:05</span>):  Governments of all persuasions in the last 10 years have not done a service to our country. By whatever metric you want to balance it, you will find that the Australian people are being disadvantaged. When they talk about tax reform in this place, make no mistake, I say to the good people of Australia, that they are talking about putting your taxes up. It has zero to do with making your taxes lower or reducing your cost of living. What they are looking to do is to get more of your money to pay for more programs to try and fix the problems they've created from their previous programs and ideology that goes with it. It's an extraordinary assessment and indictment of where we are in politics today. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">If you want to have a fairer tax system, you will lower taxes. Lowering taxes will mean there is less incentive for people to try and avoid them through complicated schemes or through negative gearing. You will encourage a greater proportion of the population to actually pay some tax. About half the Australian people get more in benefits than they pay in taxation. It is not because there are no jobs out there. It is because we are incentivising people to do the wrong thing. This is what leadership is all about: determining that government is too big, too cumbersome, too expensive. It is not the cure to the problems that we face. It is the problem that we face. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">If you want any further indication of that, you have to examine the electricity market in this country. It is a debacle. Every single issue related to it is caused by government regulation, government intervention and government involvement. They will not acknowledge that. They still cook up schemes to try and fix the problems they've created, and it is making it worse. If you want fairer, simpler taxes, if you want fairer, simpler government, you need to vote for the Australian Conservatives.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Tasmania</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">18:08</span>):  I'd like to make a contribution to this debate. I think we have to start from the very beginning. When this Prime Minister went to the last election, he promised that he would be delivering leadership. He promised at the election that there would be an agile, innovative and adult government. We're still waiting for that to emerge. The Prime Minister wants credit for just saying that things are going to happen when, in fact, this is just rhetoric. It's fine to say that, but what the Australian people are looking for is leadership. They are looking for the leadership that was promised to them by this Prime Minister, but he has failed. He has failed miserably in being able to bring any solutions when it comes to the inequality in this country, when it comes to stimulating the economy, when it comes to creating full-time jobs. It's alright to come in here, as Senator Williams has, and quote the figures, but what we are seeing out in regional and rural Australia is very different to what is really being delivered by this government. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">What we do know from this Prime Minister, though, is that he looks after his mates. He looks after the top end of town. But if you want to look for a future government that is actually going to deliver in terms of changes and real reforms around taxation, about making housing affordable for young Australians and young families trying to get their foothold into the housing market, that will be a Shorten Labor government. We have already been out there talking about negative gearing and the changes that need to happen in relation to capital gains tax. We have put this out for the community so they will know well in advance what our economic policies are going to deliver for their futures, and for those families trying to get into the housing market. This government is paralysed by the dysfunction that we see day by day in this place, and that the Australian people see. And it's not just me saying that. I won't do what Senator Abetz normally does and say 'Guess who says this?'—I will quote from a newspaper report of the Liberal-National Party caucus meeting this morning: </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Small">Malcolm Turnbull has fended off a backbench complaint about the government’s dire position in the opinion polls in the wake of this week’s Newspoll showing the Coalition is trailing Labor …</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The important thing here is that this was a Queensland Liberal Party backbencher, and a very experienced former minister, I might add. He rose in the coalition joint party room on Tuesday morning to ask the Prime Minister why the government was doing so poorly with voters if the economic policies were supposedly working. It is not just an issue being raised by people on this side. People out in the community talk to me on a regular basis about how difficult it is, about not getting a fair go and about their concerns over housing affordability, whether it's in Tasmania or around the rest of the country. I was in WA last week and the same issues were raised. This is a former minister. Okay, he was sacked twice from the ministry but, nevertheless, he was a minister. If he is asking those sorts of questions in their caucus room, then surely this government—surely the Prime Minister, and surely the Treasurer—can come up with some sort of visionary outlook for the future direction that they need to take to make our taxation system fairer.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">When we are talking about taxation, every time Mr Morrison complains about tax increases millions of low- and middle-income earners need to remember he wants to increase your income tax. That's the reality. Every time Mr Morrison complains about wage growth, Australians need to remember he backs a cut to your penalty rates. Every time Mr Morrison talks about Labor's economic or tax policy, he just invents new numbers. We know that. They made these outlandish claims about the Parliamentary Budget Office doing the calculations on our policies, and they were complete and utter lies. They are so desperate; they are so dysfunctional. They are a chaotic government without any leadership. The Prime Minister tells us he's a strong leader—well, in this place he won't show the leadership that he needs to in ensuring Senator Nash steps out of cabinet and goes to the backbench until her citizenship is established by the High Court. He is a weak leader. <span style="font-style:italic;">(Time expired)</span></span>

                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Senator PATERSON</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Victoria</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">18:13</span>):  Judging by that contribution, Senator Polley's knowledge of how the coalition party room works is about as detailed as my knowledge of how the Labor Party caucus works, but at least I know that, when they meet, it is called a caucus and when we meet it is called a party room—but I'm sure Senator Polley's next contribution on this matter will use the correct terminology. I'm very pleased for a couple of reasons to contribute to this discussion tonight. First of all, I'm really heartened by the Labor Party's new-found concern for and focus on fixing the budget. It's not a concern that they showed very much when they were in government, obviously, given that they turned what was the best set of books in the Western world into the worst set of books in the Western world in just a few years, but obviously it is a concern that they have now discovered. I have to say, it is not really a concern they've even had in their first few years in opposition after losing office, because they have fought tooth and nail every single step of the way to deny our choices to fix the budget and to stifle our attempts to bring the budget back into shape. I am pleased to see they now have a concern about fixing the budget. Perhaps we will see in this new-found attitude from the Labor Party a willingness to support some of the savings measures that the government has proposed but have not been successful with in this chamber, in part due to their opposition. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Perhaps the government should bring back to the Senate some savings initiatives that were previously rejected by the Senate, given the Labor Party's new-found concern for this issue. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">And they should be concerned about this issue, as we all should be concerned about this issue, because there is nothing fair at all about giving the next generation the obligations that this generation weren't able to meet. There's nothing moral or fair about expecting our children and grandchildren to pick up the tab for the lifestyle that we are leading today and for the expenses that we have failed to meet. Every time the government runs a budget deficit we are spending money on ourselves today that we have failed to fund adequately. I believe that is a very unfair thing. And I'm sure, with the Labor Party's concern about budget fairness, that they will soon reverse their opposition to our savings initiatives and support them to ensure that we can return the budget to surplus more quickly.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I'm also pleased to know that they want to make the tax system fairer, although I am concerned that their policy proposals to do so are somewhat inconsistent with that goal. There is nothing fair about increasing taxes by $150 billion, as the Labor Party propose to do. They propose to do so by increasing taxes on small business. Do we really think it's fair to increase taxes on small business, as well as medium and large businesses, to the tune of $65 billion by not supporting the rest of our Enterprise Tax Plan and reversing the existing tax cuts that we have already delivered to small business as part of our Enterprise Tax Plan? They're planning to increase taxes on housing by $32 billion by scrapping negative gearing, about which I will have more to say in a moment. They're planning to increase taxes by $13 billion by increasing the capital gains tax, which, again, I will have more to say about in a moment. They're planning to increase taxes on family trusts—or, more accurately, small businesses and eventually, no doubt, farmers as well—by $15 billion. They're proposing to increase income taxes on some of the hardest working and most productive Australians by $22 billion. And of course they propose to raise $20 billion more in superannuation than the government currently is, although they haven't specified exactly how they're going to do that.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">So, with more than $150 billion of tax increases, I think we are entitled to ask how that is delivering a fairer tax system. How is slugging the Australian people with more tax than they already pay—which, frankly, I think is very high by world standards and higher than I would like it to be—a fair thing to do? If we are to ensure that the tax system is more fair, there is one way we can do that, and that is by cutting taxes. I'm proud to be part of a government that has started to do that, and I look forward to the government being able to do so even more in the future when the budget returns to a state that allows that. Of course, that process will be expedited by hopefully the opposition's newfound position of supporting savings measures in the Senate.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">But of course if we want to cut taxes in a fair way then we have to look at who currently pays taxes and who pays the most taxes. It's only logical that those who are currently shouldering the biggest burden of tax should be those who receive the first and most significant tax cuts if such cuts are to come. I'd like all Australians to have a tax cut, but I'd especially like those Australians who are shouldering a particularly heavy burden of tax at the moment to receive a tax cut, and that is particularly those taxpayers who are in the pay-as-you-go tax system who have high incomes and an especially highly taxed form of income.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">This motion also relates to housing affordability, and they wouldn't be the Labor Party if they didn't think you could roll up a radical change to the tax system to address an unrelated social problem, which is the very serious problem of housing affordability. All the best international evidence shows, as I have said in debates like this before and as Senator Williams alluded to in his contribution earlier, that the most significant factor in the affordability of housing is not the price of the house itself but the price of the land on which the house sits. The best thing any government can do to ensure that housing becomes more affordable is to make that land more affordable. And how do you make land more affordable? You make more land available. That will increase the supply of land and decrease the price of land. Unfortunately, that's not something that's within the remit of the federal government to control. That's something that state governments control. And I note for the record that the majority of those governments are of the Labor Party persuasion. So perhaps this motion today is intended to shame those state Labor governments into releasing more land so that they the supply of housing can be increased and prices can be reduced so that young people who want to enter the housing market—my generation, many of my friends among them—can do so in a more affordable way.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Finally, we've seen in this debate, as we often do at these times, references to inequality, the catchcry of the Labor Party, which they seem to have picked up from the Greens. There was a very timely research note put out last week—a parliamentary research brief—by the good people at the Institute of Public Affairs, who, some senators will know, I have an association with as my former employer. Daniel Wild published an excellent piece on four facts about inequality in Australia. In the interests of full disclosure, I did not work with Mr Wild directly; he joined the IPA after I left. He published a number of really pertinent facts about the inequality debate, the most important of which is the fact that inequality, as measured by the most academically accepted and reliable measure of inequality, the Gini coefficient, has not increased in Australia; in fact, it's decreased. When you rely on both ABS measures and the superior—in Mr Wild's view—HILDA measures, which I agree are a more a reliable source, income inequality is shown to have decreased—slightly, I admit—from 2001, where it was 0.31, to 0.30 in 2015. That is a positive development. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">It is also worth pointing out that although Australia has wealth which is distributed in an unequal way—like all countries that have a free enterprise system do to some extent—by world standards we are a country with very equally distributed wealth. In fact, in the distribution of wealth we are the third most equal country in the developed world, behind only Japan and Belgium. That's according to a recent Credit Suisse report. We are more equal than New Zealand, France, Switzerland, United Kingdom, Netherlands, Germany, United States and Denmark. That is an impressive achievement for Australia. </span>

                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Senator BURSTON</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">New South Wales</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">18:21</span>):  I would like to thank the Ecuadorian senator for bringing attention to these problems her party has worked so hard to create. Let's not forget that it was the Labor Party that wrecked our budget in the first place with cash handouts for dead people and pink batts that burnt down houses and killed people. The Rudd government shovelled money out of the door, literally throwing away money for the sake of it. They blew a $22 billion surplus left by the Howard government. This was mad, reckless spending with no economic justification. The Keynesian arguments imported from America never applied to Australia, as we were never in a liquidity trap. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Now the Labor Party finally wake up to the fact that the budget they broke needs fixing—now that it is someone else's problem. They still will never support even a dollar being trimmed from our bloated welfare budget. They are no longer the party for working Australians. They now represent higher taxes and handouts. In Labor's world, all the work of budget repair will be done with new taxes, paid for by the working Australians they used to represent. They want to bring back the carbon tax—literally a tax on the air that we breathe—to stop the ocean rising a few millimetres in the next hundred years. This will raise electricity prices beyond the reach of many Australians. They want to levy new taxes on family trusts, which are used by virtually every family business in Australia. That's what you get from Labor when you try to earn a buck and help out your family, but if you sit on your bum, shoot up ice and demand a disability pension, don't worry: they'll be right in your corner. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Labor says they want to make housing affordable, but look what they do: they strangle the housing supply with regulations and green tape. At the same time, whenever they are in government they flood this country with immigrants and sell Australia piece by piece to foreign interests. You are never going to make housing affordable by supporting massive immigration and making more and more people fight over less and less. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Once again, thank you to Senator Gallagher for using some of her little remaining time in parliament to draw attention to these issues. The best way we can get started on fixing them is by never sending another vote in Labor's direction ever again.</span>

                  <a href="121628" type="MemberSpeech">
                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Senator McALLISTER</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">New South Wales</span>—<span class="HPS-MinisterialTitles">Deputy Opposition Whip in the Senate</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">18:23</span>):  Last week the Reserve Bank issued its 2017-18 corporate plan. No doubt everybody here had this marked in their calendar. It makes for interesting reading because it sets out what the RBA thinks are the key risks for its monetary policy functions in the year ahead. It draws attention to two particularly interesting sets of risks. The first is slow wages growth. The RBA identified, with classic economist understatement, that wage growth has declined to low levels in recent years. In fact, over the last year, overall annual wage price index growth has been at almost exactly 1.9 per cent. This is the lowest figure recorded by the ABS since it began the data series in the nineties. Private sector real wages have been negative. In other words, private sector wage earners are now worse off than they were 12 months ago. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The second set of interesting risks identified by the RBA relate to household debt. The RBA notes that there has been a substantial build-up in household debt, and it recognises that the high debt levels mean that monetary policies' ability to stimulate growth may be more limited than in the past. Let's be clear about what that refers to. Housing debt is now so high that the Reserve Bank is worried that it can't use interest rates to stave off a recession. The RBA is right to be concerned about debt. We are taking on more. Average home debt has doubled in real terms since the early 2000s. We're also taking longer to pay it off. Since 1990, the number of people with a mortgage debt has doubled in the 45-to-55 age group and has tripled in the 55-to-65 age group. People are entering retirement with mortgage debt. People who can't afford that level of debt are being locked out altogether from the housing market, and the rate of home ownership for under 40s is 50 per cent less than what it was in the early 2000s. Those are the two key risks highlighted by the RBA—wage growth and housing affordability.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">There's a lot in the economy that you can't control when you're in government. It's the worst-kept secret in Canberra. There are commodity price spikes, global recessions and cyclones that wipe out entire banana crops. But what about wages? You can do something about wages and housing affordability, but this government has not only refused to act but also refuses to even admit that these things are a problem. We will never forget that the former Treasurer's solution for housing affordability was to 'get a better job' or that the Minister for Finance, until recently, just denied that there was any kind of demand problem in housing. We shouldn't forget that, at the same time as the RBA is talking about the problems posed by slow wages growth, this government has been reducing incomes for the most vulnerable. It's been cutting penalty rates, cutting benefits and cutting payments. Its only solution for jobs and growth seems to be corporate tax cuts that deliver nothing more than dividends and share buybacks.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The Treasurer is still filling out the practise exercises from the back of a 1987 economics textbook. Today's economic problems are different, but the problem is that this government is so fixated on fighting the class war from decades ago that it cannot act on the issues that are facing people today. It cannot act on housing affordability, it cannot act on slow wages growth and it will not act on the root cause of soaring electricity prices. We know what the solutions to these problems are—reform to negative gearing to tackle the distortion of investment into that sector, a fairer tax system and empowering workers to bargain for higher wages. But what we also know is that this government will never have the vision to put those things in place.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Small">Mr Speaker, on behalf of the Joint Standing Committee on Foreign Affairs, Defence and Trade, it is my pleasure to present today the Committee's interim report for the <span style="font-style:italic;">inquiry into establishing a Modern Slavery Act in Australia. </span>I am pleased to Chair the Foreign Affairs and Aid Sub-Committee which is undertaking this inquiry and produced this report.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">Modern slavery is a heinous crime that devastates millions of people around the world. Slavery is not a crime from the past, but is all around us today. Modern slavery is an umbrella term describing a range of exploitative crimes, including: human trafficking, forced labour, bonded labour, child labour, forced marriage, orphanage trafficking, sexual slavery and other slavery-like practices. About 46 million people are victims of modern slavery around the world, including over 30 million victims in the Asia‑Pacific.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">The Committee's inquiry is investigating how Australia's laws, policies and practices can be improved to better combat modern slavery here and around the world. The inquiry is, in particular, looking at whether measures similar to or improving upon the United Kingdom's <span style="font-style:italic;">Modern Slavery Act 2015</span> could be introduced here. This interim report outlines recommendations and statements of in-principle support, focussing on combating modern slavery in the global supply chains of companies, businesses, organisations and governments operating in Australia. The Committee resolved to prepare this report to help inform the Australian Government's contribution the Bali Process Forum in Perth on 24 and 25 August, with the full content of a Modern Slavery Act to be considered in the final report.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">Mr Speaker, the Committee has heard about the devastating impact of these appalling crimes around the world. At its recent hearing in Melbourne, we heard the shocking experiences of Ms Sophea Touch, who became a domestic slave in Cambodia when she was just four years old. Through her childhood, Ms Touch was forced to work in appalling conditions as she was passed from one family to another, each more abusive and violent than the next. She was starved, beaten and abused. She could not escape. She was a modern day slave. This human example highlights the importance of this inquiry to ensure Australia is doing all it can to eradicate modern slavery.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">To date, the Committee has published over 200 submissions and held public hearings in Canberra, Sydney and Melbourne, with further hearings planned in regional Australia. Submitters and witnesses have made many recommendations to improve Australia's response to modern slavery including prevention measures, support for victims, improvements to Australia's visa regime and prevention of orphanage tourism. The Committee thanks all submitters and witnesses who have contributed so far. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">As noted, this interim report focusses on supply chains. Under the UK Modern Slavery Act, businesses and organisations operating in the UK with a turnover of 36 million pounds, about 60 million dollars, must report annually on measures taken to ensure that their global supply chains are free of modern slavery. Similar reporting requirements have also been introduced in the United States and elsewhere in Europe.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">The interim report summarises the evidence heard by the Committee so far. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">Overwhelmingly, there has been strong support for the introduction of an Australian Modern Slavery Act, including global supply chain reporting requirements and an Independent Anti-Slavery Commissioner. Businesses, unions and NGOs are all largely supportive of introducing supply chain reporting requirements here in Australia to raise awareness of modern slavery risks, to eradicate these crimes where found, to reduce corporate risk, to provide investor confidence and to ensure a fair market, where businesses using modern slavery do not have a competitive advantage.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">This interim report also highlights a number of key principles raised at this stage by submitters and witnesses that an Australian supply chain reporting requirement should include. This includes support for consistency with international jurisdictions and best practice, mandated supply chain reporting and the establishment of a central repository of modern slavery statements.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">The report makes three recommendations. The first is that the Australian Government consider supporting in-principle the development of a Modern Slavery Act in Australia, including supply chain reporting requirements for companies, businesses, organisations and governments, and an Independent Anti-Slavery Commissioner. This reflects the strong support the Committee heard for these measures. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">The second recommendation is that the government consider this recommendation as part of Australia's contribution to the Bali Process Forum next week.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">The final recommendation is that the Government consider this interim report as part of its current review of corporate reporting in the UK and around the world, with a view to developing legislation in Australia. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">I'm pleased the Australian Government has this week come out in support of mandated business supply chain reporting with a proposed 100 million dollar threshold, agreed to a central repository and opened up consultation on these proposals in conjunction with our inquiry.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">Importantly, the report offers in-principle support for, and considerations of, several key principles suggested by submitters and witnesses including: the introduction of an opt-in threshold for companies allowing any companies below the threshold to submit a modern slavery statement; a central repository; and Independent Anti-Slavery Commissioner; applying reporting requirements to government procurement (which is a key criticism of the UK Act); publishing a list of companies who need to report and those that don't report; penalties for companies that don't report; looking at prescribing reporting requirements and due diligence; and producing guidance for businesses.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">The report also identifies a number of areas for further consideration, including what possible penalties could be, the role of an Independent Anti‑Slavery Commissioner and other measures to combat modern slavery. The Committee will continue to investigate these issues in its final report in accordance with our terms of reference, providing further direction to Government on modern slavery legislation</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">We have a unique, once-in-a-lifetime opportunity to take the lead on stamping out modern slavery for good, particularly with over 30 million victims in our region. I'm proud of the Turnbull Coalition Government who initiated this inquiry, who took the proverbial bull by the horns, as well as the bipartisan support this issue has now generated. Let us not miss the opportunity to continue taking strong action on this issue. I look forward to working with the Committee for the remainder of this inquiry to recommend then implement strong action to eradicate this appalling crime. Modern slavery must stop.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">Mr Speaker, I commend the interim report to the House.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The report of the Joint Standing Committee of Public Accounts and Audit titled <span style="font-style:italic;">Commonwealth financial statements</span><span style="font-style:italic;"></span>sets out the findings of the committee's inquiry based on audit report No. 33 2016-17: <span style="font-style:italic;">Audits of the financial statements of Australian government entities for the period ended 30 June 2016</span>. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The committee noted that the 2015-16 consolidated financial statements were prepared in accordance with the Public Governance, Performance and Accountability Act 2013 and the requirements of the Australian accounting standards, and that an unmodified auditor's report for the statements was issued on 28 November 2016. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The committee also noted that the Auditor-General had issued auditor reports on the 2015-16 financial statements of 246 Commonwealth entities up until 9 December 2016, and that all auditor reports were unmodified.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Some 245 findings were reported to entities as a result of the audits, comprising four significant, 32 moderate and 209 minor findings. The National Disability Insurance Agency and the Department of Education and Training both had significant audit findings, and the Department of Defence and the Australian Taxation Office both had multiple moderate audit findings. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The committee noted progress by these entities in responding to the audit findings. However, the committee recommended that, if next year's financial statement audits for these entities resulted in any significant or moderate findings, they should report back to the committee on their progress in responding to those findings. Noting the two significant legislative breaches reported to the Northern Land Council during 2015-16, the committee also recommended that the council report back on progress in responding to these breaches, and any such breaches reported next financial year.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">During the course of the committee's inquiry, the Department of Finance took a number of steps to reinstate the previous practice for all Commonwealth entities, including government business enterprises, to disclose details of senior executive remuneration. This had been discontinued as a result of aligning the new PGPA financial reporting rule with international and Australian accounting standards. However, while acknowledging the importance of compliance with accounting standards, the committee emphasised that the accountability needs of the parliament and Australian public must continue to be met. The committee also had concerns about some of the mechanisms being used to reinstate remuneration disclosure. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The committee therefore recommended that, consistent with previous practice, more transparent disclosure of senior executive remuneration, including salary bands, should be a formal requirement, not by request. This requirement should be duly reflected in the relevant legislation and guidance, and the relevant disclosure published in entity annual reports rather than on entity websites. Finance should also report back to the committee on options for strengthening remuneration disclosure requirements, giving consideration to the requirements for the Australian Stock Exchange listed companies. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We further recommended that Finance develop benchmarks to enable entities to assess their financial sustainability against agreed parameters over time. Finance should also note the committee's proposal that more transparent reporting on contracts and consultancies, earlier delivery of annual reports and improved entity audit committees be considered as part of the independent review of the PGPA Act.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">In conclusion, the Auditor-General's financial statement audits play a critical role in ensuring accountability to the parliament and the Australian public for the expenditure of public funds. The audits provide independent assurance that this information is accurate and that the financial management of Commonwealth entities is effective. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The committee commends the Auditor-General for his work each year in auditing the consolidated financial statements and Commonwealth entity financial statements. We also commend the Audit Office for its work in reviewing the progress of each entity in addressing any significant or moderate findings from the previous year's audit. I thank the committee members for their deliberations on these significant matters. I commend the report to the Senate. </span>

                  <span class="HPS-Small">Given the common approach of grant programmes to deliver government funding, the Committee was concerned that granting departments are not consistently applying the requirements of the Commonwealth grants framework.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">The Committee was concerned that significant shortcomings remain in departments' processing of grant applications, as well as their assessment practices. Eligibility requirements were not clearly set-out in programme guidelines, applicants were treated inconsistently in relation to eligibility requirements and eligibility assessments were not conducted in a transparent or timely manner.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">The Committee highlighted instances were ineligible applications proceeded through to merit assessment, and in some cases, were ultimately funded. The Committee viewed this as an important public administration issue. Grant applications that do not meet policy objectives, as expressed in eligibility criteria, should not receive funding.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">The Committee acknowledged the importance of the two Grants Hubs— created as part of the whole-of-government Streamlining Grants Administration Initiative—in fostering consistency, thoroughness, and compliance with the Government's policy framework across these front- end processes. During this period of transition, newly shared arrangements may create risks where responsibilities are not clearly articulated or understood and intentions and outcomes may misalign.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">The Committee recommended that the three programme departments establish formal partnership agreements with their respective Grants Hub (where they have not already done so), and ensure that new or existing arrangements:</span>

                  <span class="HPS-SmallBullet">clearly articulate overarching assurance processes that support the balance between better practice administration and the achievement of policy outcomes.</span>

                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">The Committee also recognised the importance of accurate and complete advice for Ministers to make decisions to either approve or reject funding recommendations. The evidence presented revealed that the issues were not just system or process related, but also cultural. The</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">Committee considered the need for departments to instil cultural change, drawing attention to training as one of the fundamental features in influencing a department-wide cultural shift. The Committee recommended that the three programme departments measure the number of staff formally trained with regard to the Government's grants policy framework and quickly rectify gaps to retain sufficient expertise and ensure policy compliance.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">Regarding written advice to decision-makers, the Inquiry pursued the ANAO's recurring audit finding of inadequate record keeping. The Committee highlighted that departments must maintain detailed, contemporaneous records to support funding recommendations to provide adequate assurance regarding those specific projects/activities that have been approved and the terms of that approval.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">The Committee also examined departments' approaches to evaluating grants programmes—which is a key part to implementing effective granting processes. The Committee was concerned that departments are not taking a 'strong early focus' on formulating an evaluation strategy. In some cases evaluation frameworks are not formalised and/or implemented until years after a programme commences.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">The Committee stressed the importance of departments actively collecting, sharing and acting upon lessons learned, encouraging 'communities of practice' as well as the development of model guidance documents. The Committee noted that while it is prudent to disseminate learnings from audits and other evaluation activities across a department, it is not simply enough to do so. Similar to many of the issues canvassed in this Inquiry, a supporting culture led by a</span>

                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">Department or Agency Executive team is required and should be supported as part of any training programs.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">The Committee strongly supported the ANAO's recommendations (across the suite of reports) and recognised that full implementation is essential for continued shortcomings to be rectified. The Committee recommended that the three programme departments report on progress against the Auditor-General's respective recommendations, including clearly indicating whether full implementation has been achieved.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">Grants continue to be used as a common approach to deliver government funding. Based on the Committee's findings in this Inquiry and given the new whole-of-government arrangements, the Committee flagged that future scrutiny of grants administration will pay attention to whether:</span>

                  <span class="HPS-SmallBullet">departments have made a conscious effort and achieved any necessary cultural shifts so that risks that feed into prior deficiencies are mitigated and full alignment with the Government's overarching grants policy framework occurs.</span>

                      <span class="HPS-MemberContinuation">Senator SINGH:</span>
                    </a>  As a member of this joint standing committee, I heard throughout the inquiry about the devastating impact of modern slavery and the need for stronger measures to combat it. The interim report that has been tabled here in the Senate today is the first step towards implementing stronger measures to combat modern slavery here in Australia. So far, the committee has heard about the tens and tens of millions of people who are trapped in slavery and slavery-like conditions around the world, but two-thirds of them are actually in the Asia-Pacific. They're enslaved in the global supply chains of products and services that Australians use every day. They are victims of exploitation in private sector activities such as manufacturing, construction and agriculture. In Australia, they tend to be men, women and children trapped in forced labour, sex trafficking and debt bondage by exploitative criminal syndicates. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Of course, no person wants to purchase goods tainted by slavery, but often, unbeknownst to them, they are doing so. The same goes with business. No business wants to have slavery in its supply chain, but, currently, consumers and businesses are left in the dark about it. That is why Australia needs a modern slavery act, which is what this committee has been inquiring into. The input of raw material elements in the supply chains is where the worst forms of worker abuse occur. Forced labour and child labour are the most prevalent. According to the Walk Free Foundation, it is because globalisation has resulted in the demand for cheap labour that modern slavery is often hidden within a vast range of supply chains, a long, long way from a country like Australia, where the goods are in the end sold. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Legislation similar to a modern slavery act is currently in place in the UK, France, Canada, the EU and California. Enacting that kind of modern slavery act in Australia would ensure that we would be doing all that we could to fight slavery and finish this horrific practice. A modern slavery act would enable Australia to live up to its commitment to the United Nations sustainable goal 8.7, which is to take immediate, effective measures to eradicate forced labour and end all forms of modern slavery, human trafficking and child labour. </span>

                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This interim report addresses one aspect of how to better combat modern slavery in global supply chains of Australian businesses, companies, organisations and governments. The report recommends that major Australian companies publicly report on steps they are taking to tackle slavery in their business or supply chains. It would ensure that no Australian company was either directly or indirectly engaged in modern slavery. Further recommendations include establishing an antislavery commissioner to help victims of modern slavery right here in Australia and fighting slavery both in Australia and overseas. These recommendations were presented as part of Australia's contribution to the Bali Process Government and Business Forum held only last week in Perth. It is an important process to ensure that Australia is doing all that it can, that it is doing its part, to combat modern slavery. This interim report lays the groundwork for a modern slavery act in Australia. There is still, indeed, a lot of work for this committee to do, so it is only an interim report at this stage. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Having said that, though, it was in April this year that Labor announced our support for a modern slavery act. We made very clear that we want to improve transparency within the business supply chains. Our shadow minister for justice, Clare O'Neil, outlined how Labor would commit to establishing an antislavery commissioner and helping victims of modern slavery right here in Australia. Earlier last month, the parliamentary Joint Committee on Law Enforcement, which I also sit on, backed Labor's policy calling for the government to consider enacting a modern slavery act when it handed down its report on human trafficking, slavery and slavery-like practices, which also included a number of recommendations which the current Joint Committee on Foreign Affairs, Defence and Trade is looking at in its modern slavery act inquiry to help its deliberations in that way. Labor has had a lot of support. Obviously there have been a lot of submissions during this inquiry process as well. They have come from Fair Trade Australia, the Law Council of Australia, University of Melbourne experts, Hagar Australia, Slavery Links, the Australian Council of Trade Unions, the Red Cross, the Salvation Army, Anti-Slavery Australia and ACRATH—a lot of experts in the field and a lot of community representation made.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">But I would just like to draw on some of the remarks that have been made in relation to the government's announcement and the recommendations it refers to in this interim report. These remarks come from the Law Council of Australia's president, Fiona McLeod. She has for some time now played a very prominent role during the course of her career in advocating for a more robust approach in Australia to antislavery. She said:</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">Unfortunately, exploitation is alive and well in modern Australia.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">In recent years alone we have seen shocking domestic examples of human trafficking, sex slavery, forced labour, deceptive recruiting for labour services, forced marriage, and debt bondage. And we know what comes to light is only a very tiny sample of what lurks in the shadows.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">Requiring large businesses to scrutinise their supply chains and report on measures they are taking to combat exploitation is a very important mechanism to shine a light on modern slavery.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">She goes on to raise some of the issues that this committee is going to have to continue with when it hands down its final report, and that is to do with the threshold of the turnover of a business. Fiona McLeod and the Law Council believe that the reporting threshold should be somewhat less than the $100 million that the current Turnbull government have announced as being fit.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I think this is an area of contention and ongoing debate, and our committee is going to have to look at what that threshold should be and what we end up recommending. Ms McLeod outlines that the consultation paper that the government put out has the $100 million threshold, which the Law Council thinks should be reduced, as it '<span style="&#xD;&#xA;    font-family:FoundersGrotesk;&#xD;&#xA;  &#xD;&#xA;    color:#0A0A0A;&#xD;&#xA;  text-decoration:none underline;">only captures some 2,000 companies and a lower threshold would do more to address the problem'. </span>I think that is a very worthwhile consideration and something that also needs to be addressed. She also outlines how the UK antislavery legislation model captures all businesses that have revenue equivalent to A$60 million and over and how that may be a more appropriate threshold level. She outlines something that Labor has been very strong on, and that is that there should be robust penalties for noncompliance to ensure rigour and accountability. This is really important because, without looking at some kind of penalties approach, businesses simply won't take this seriously and therefore a modern slavery act won't set out to achieve what we want it to achieve.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">So Labor welcomes very much the input from the Law Council of Australia and a number of community organisations, academics and experts in the field who know too well that we are well overdue in Australia to act to combat modern slavery. Who would have thought that in 2017 we would still be talking about these issues of modern slavery, forced labour and sexual servitude? Well, indeed we are, and the only way to address it is to have some legislation to change that behaviour on the part of business and to address slavery in those global supply chains so that we don't see an ongoing repeat, right here in Australia today and indeed in our region, of something that happened over 100 years ago. I seek leave to continue my remarks.</span>

The CMS acquittal process by the card holder has not changed. The process of checking card holder transactions has moved to a risk based sampling approach undertaken by the Chief Financial Officer head office. This includes the forensics data analytics. The CMS supervisor retains visibility of their staffs CMS transactions. Automated systems generated reminder emails to CMS supervisors notifying them of their staffs outstanding CMS transactions continues.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Small">I am pleased to present a bill which will excise compensation coverage for Australian Defence Force members and former members with service prior to 1 July 2004 from other Commonwealth employees, providing a 'military specific' scheme for the long-term administration of claims for Defence Force members. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">The bill will duplicate the existing Safety, Rehabilitation and Compensation Act 1988 (SRCA) as a standalone act, with appropriate amendments to give full control of the act to the Minister for Veterans' Affairs. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">Importantly, eligibility and benefits under the standalone act will be the same as those currently available to serving and former ADF members under the existing SRCA. I will just repeat that because it is very important: importantly, eligibility and benefits under the standalone act will be the same as those currently available to serving and former ADF members under the existing SRCA. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">There are no other changes to benefits or entitlements in the new act or the enabling bill. The new act will simply replicate the SRCA and retain the provisions that currently apply to members and former members of the ADF. Indeed, section 121B specifically operates to protect the entitlements of those covered by the SRCA and to ensure that no person is disadvantaged by the enactment of this act. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">It will not apply to (or impact on) veterans with eligibility under the Veterans' Entitlements Act 1986 (VEA) or the Military Rehabilitation and Compensation Act 2004 (MRCA). </span>

                  <span class="HPS-Small">The VEA and the MRCA will remain in place and DVA clients with entitlements under these acts will be unaffected by the commencement of the new act. </span>

                  <span class="HPS-Small">The Safety, Rehabilitation and Compensation Act 1988 currently provides compensation coverage to all Commonwealth employees and is administered by Comcare on behalf of the Department of Employment. </span>

                  <span class="HPS-Small">The current act is also administered by the Department of Veterans' Affairs, with part XI extending coverage to Australian Defence Force members and former members for injuries and illnesses linked to service prior to 1 July 2004. </span>

                  <span class="HPS-Small">While the Safety, Rehabilitation and Compensation Act 1988 ceased to apply to new periods of Defence Force service from 1 July 2004, a significant proportion of ongoing compensation and treatment expenditure under the act continues to apply to current and former Defence Force personnel. </span>

                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">The development of a standalone SRCA for ADF members and veterans was announced by government nearly two years ago, during which time DVA has been consulting with Defence and ex-service representatives (both of which have been supportive of a standalone act). </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">The duplication of the Safety, Rehabilitation and Compensation Act 1988 in the form of the Safety, Rehabilitation and Compensation (Defence-related Claims) Act 1988 is important for DVA as it will give the Minister for Veterans' Affairs responsibility for all compensation acts covering ADF members. Once again, this is worth highlighting: these changes will give the Minister for Veterans' Affairs responsibility for all compensation acts covering ADF members. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">It is a foundational step towards broader reform being undertaken by the Department of Veterans' Affairs to significantly improve services for veterans and their families by re-engineering DVA business processes. To enable this veteran-centric reform to occur, it is essential that policy responsibility for relevant legislation sits with the Minister for Veterans' Affairs. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">It will also allow DVA to consult with the veteran and Defence communities in the future on areas of potential alignment with the Military Rehabilitation and Compensation Act 2004 once the standalone act commences. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">I want to acknowledge the strong support for the establishment of the Safety, Rehabilitation and Compensation (Defence-related Claims) Act 1988 from the Ex-Service Organisation Round Table (ESORT) and the Department of Defence and I am privileged to have the opportunity to bring about a change that will allow the government to ensure that the changing needs of our injured and ill Defence Force members and their families are appropriately met into the future. </span>

                  <span class="HPS-Small">Through limited merits reviews, monopoly network businesses in electricity and gas have been able to seek review from the Australian Competition Tribunal of decisions made by the Australian Energy Regulator (AER) and the Economic Regulation Authority of Western Australia. This includes decisions on regulated revenues that flow through to network prices paid by energy consumers for electricity and gas transmission and distribution. To date LMR has increased consumer bills by $6.5 billion.</span>

                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">The LMR regime was first reviewed in 2012 by an independent panel led by Professor George Yarrow. Amendments were made in 2013 with the goal of improving timeliness, reducing costs, increasing consumer participation and refocussing the process on the long term interests of consumers.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">Despite these attempted reforms, energy networks were still routinely seeking reviews of the regulators' decisions, essentially using the Australian Competition Tribunal as a second regulator. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">In response the Council of Australian Governments (COAG) Energy Council reviewed the LMR regime again in 2016. The review found that the 2013 amendments to the regime had largely failed, including that LMR: remained routine; had significant costs to all participants; presented barriers to meaningful consumer participation; led to significant regulatory and price uncertainty; and was failing to demonstrate outcomes that were in the long term interests of consumers. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">The COAG Energy Council determined that the LMR regime was still failing to meet its policy intent with the consequence of higher prices for consumers. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">In the face of escalating energy prices the Government is taking action to stop energy networks using LMR to extract monopoly rents from consumers. </span>
                </p>

                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Queensland</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">18:49</span>):  I wasn't really intending to participate in this debate but I heard some speakers before and thought there was such a misconception of what the actual bill is about and, more importantly, the arguments surrounding the bill and amendment moved by the Labor Party. For the record, let me indicate as other speakers have done that the bill implements sensible measures to fix clear issues with the operation of the Fair Work Act. They repeal the requirement for four-yearly reviews of modern awards from 1 January. They enable the Fair Work Commission to overlook minor procedural and technical errors when approving an enterprise agreement, and they apply the Judicial Misbehaviour and Incapacity (Parliamentary Commissions) Act 2012 to Fair Work Commission members. This bill should have been relatively uncontroversial but, unfortunately, the Labor Party and the Greens have politicised it and have tried to move amendments that completely undermine the independence of the Fair Work Commission. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">For those who might be following this debate and perhaps have been misled by some of the previous speakers, I want to emphasise that the Fair Work Commission was set up by the Labor government in 2009. The then workplace relations minister, Mr Bill Shorten, amended the Fair Work Act in 2013 to specifically require the commission to consider penalty rates as part of the process. You have heard the Labor Party carrying on in this debate and generally, including on the ABC, with how the Turnbull government is trying to do something with penalty rates. It is a complete and utter misconception and misstatement of the facts. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">What the penalty rates issue is all about is the decision by the Fair Work Commission, set up by the Labor Party, to deal with penalty rates as Mr Shorten required it to do when he was the relevant minister. So the federal government has done nothing with penalty rates. If you heard all the speakers in this debate so far you would think it was a decision that cabinet has made on what the penalty rates might or might not be, but that is not so. The Fair Work Commission is the one making decisions on penalty rate. That's because Mr Bill Shorten, when he was minister, instructed it to do it. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The Labor Party are somehow insinuating that the Fair Work Commission are lackeys of the Liberal and National parties. Nothing could be further from the truth. Labor appointed all the members of the commission who made the penalty rates decision. It wasn't any strategy of the Liberal and National parties to put in commissioners who might have a particular view; it was Mr Shorten and the Labor Party who selected every single commissioner who made the decision on penalty rates. What's worse, when Mr Shorten set up these rules and appointed the umpire, he repeatedly said, 'I will respect the commission's decision.' And why wouldn't he have said that? He set up the commission, appointed the members and gave the instruction to deal with penalty rates. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">He was asked this question by Neil Mitchell:</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">The Fair Work Commission will report soon on Sunday penalty rates. They're an independent body, in fact you had a lot to do with the way they operate now when you were Minister. Will you accept their findings given this is an independent body assessing penalty rates for Sunday, if you're Prime Minister?</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Mr Shorten replied, 'Yes.' Neil Mitchell asked, 'You'll accept them?' Bill Shorten said, 'Yes.' Neil Mitchell asked, 'Even if they reduce Sunday penalty rates?' Bill Shorten said, 'Well, I said I'd accept the independent tribunal.' For anyone who is interested, that was an interview with Neil Mitchell recorded on 3AW on 21 April 2016.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">So what happened to Mr Shorten? What happened to that firm resolve to accept the independent umpire which he appointed and dealt with penalty rates, which he told them to do? He said: 'Yes, they're independent. I appointed them and of course I will accept it.' He was asked, 'Even if they reduce Sunday penalty rates?' He said, 'Yep, I'll still accept it, because they are the independent tribunal.' That was his position as recently as April last year. What is his position now? Somehow it is Senator Cash's fault, I think. If it is not her fault it is Malcolm Turnbull's fault. He is not going to accept it because it is Senator Cash and Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull who have issued the penalty rates decision. But it is not. It is the people he appointed and told to deal with penalty rates, and he said he would accept their decision as the independent umpire.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">It makes one as a parliamentarian sad to wonder what Mr Shorten would be like as a Prime Minister when he cannot—and here is one small instance—for more than a year at a time hold to his word on anything. A year ago he said he would accept it. Today he doesn't accept it and he wants to bring the government down because his Fair Work Commission made a decision to adjust penalty rates on Sunday. How could Australians ever trust a Prime Minister of this dishonesty? How could Australians trust a government that was led by a man who obviously has no scruples when it comes to penalty rates decisions?</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">But it goes further. For all that you have heard Labor senators today saying how somehow it is the government's fault and this is the greatest disaster for workers going, the Labor Party have no interest in workers. The only interest they have in workers is that a few of them—10 per cent of them—choose to join a union, pay union fees and the union then donates money to the Labor Party and then tells the Labor Party which senators they will select. That is about as much interest as Labor Party senators have in workers. They get their membership money through the unions. This is so clearly demonstrated. When Mr Shorten was the leader of the AWU, he actually reduced and removed penalty rates for some of Australia's lowest paid workers. I thank Minister Cash for alerting us to this and bringing out the obvious. It is a matter of fact, but thank you, Senator Cash, for alerting Australians to it. For example, workers at Clean Event were stripped of all penalty rates, with no compensation, under a 2006 agreement for which Mr Shorten was responsible as the national secretary of the AWU. Can I just repeat that: Mr Shorten was in charge of the AWU and did an agreement with Clean Event that there would be no penalty rates and no compensation. This is the man who today says Senator Cash and Malcolm Turnbull are bad people because they have taken away workers' penalty rates. Not only is that wrong; it is a direct lie, to be honest. Malcolm Turnbull and Senator Cash didn't. The Fair Work Commission took those away, the Fair Work Commission that, I repeat consistently, was set up by Mr Shorten, and he gave them the instruction to deal with penalty rates.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Not only was that not true but Mr Shorten himself, when he was in charge of the AWU, did away with penalty rates for the Clean Event workers, with absolutely no compensation at all. The Melbourne and Olympic Parks Trust agreement, which was approved by Mr Bill Shorten, stripped workers of all penalty rates and overtime, except for a 125 per cent penalty rate for work performed between—wait for it—1 am and 6 am. He got them a slight penalty rate for those hours, but for the rest of them he just stripped the penalty rates away, whether it was Saturday, Sunday or whatever day. So exactly when does Mr Shorten support and when does he oppose cuts to penalty rates?</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I can and will go on. Senators opposite claimed the unions were great groups looking after workers' interests. That's okay, except if you're workers at Big W. They were employed on an enterprise agreement which was negotiated by the AWU, Mr Shorten's union, and by the shoppies' union, the SDA. Mr Shorten was part of that union movement, and guess what? Big W workers were particularly significantly disadvantaged when they worked on Sunday. These workers are receiving $7.74 per hour, which is less than the award rate. The enterprise agreement reached by the AWU and the SDA arranged for workers working on Sunday to receive $7.74 per hour, which is less than the award rate for those who work a full Sunday shift.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">There are other examples. I mentioned the AWU and Clean Event, but the recent Senate Education and Employment References Committee inquiry looked into some of the deals done between the SDA, the AWU—Mr Shorten's union—and big employers to undercut penalty rates. This Senate inquiry heard evidence about deals made between the unions and McDonald's—'Big Macca'—Coles, Woolworths, KFC, Domino's, Hungry Jack's, David Jones and others that actually cut penalty rates on Sunday. It wasn't the Fair Work Commission that did this. It wasn't Senator Cash or the Prime Minister who did this. This was the union movement in an enterprise agreement with these big Australian companies, and they actually reduced the penalty rates paid on Sunday. It has been confirmed that the supposedly higher base rate for weekday work is not enough to compensate for the loss of pay on Sunday. If anyone had been listening to Labor speakers before, speaking about how good the unions are, how they look after the workers and how they do a great job and get a better deal overall, there's the evidence: overall, these workers that the unions are supposedly looking after are worse off. The Fair Work Commission did not make this decision; this was an enterprise agreement negotiated by the AWU and SDA in that instance.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">That is why, I suppose, less than 10 per cent of Australian workers in private industry choose to join a union. For one, workers don't want to join a union, because they know their union fees won't go to help them. Maybe they'll help do dodgy deals with big companies, but they won't help them. They do know that the fees that workers pay will be donated to the Australian Labor Party. Most workers in Australia, 90 per cent of workers in private industry, understand that the Australian Labor Party is not good for Australia. The last thing these workers want to do is donate their hard-earned money to the union movement so that the union movement can give it to the Labor Party. I repeat, the only interest the Labor Party has in workers is in those workers who join the union and pay their money so the union can give it to the Labor Party to campaign at elections. The union can then direct which members in the Australian Labor Party receive preselection to come into this chamber and supposedly assist with the work of the Parliament of Australia in governing for all Australians.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">These abuses have to be exposed. The deals that the unions have done with these big corporate entities in Australia—reducing, by arrangement between the unions and these big businesses, Sunday penalty rates—not only disadvantage the workers themselves but also make it very unfair for the small mum-and-dad operations who are desperately trying to get ahead. These small mum-and-dad operations—competitors to McDonalds, Coles and Woolworths—who try and open on Sundays cannot compete with these big multinational companies. Why? Because they have to pay award rates which are greater than the money paid by the multinational companies to their workers. Not only is it unfair to the workers in those multinational companies; it is unfair to small businesses who have to try and compete with those big multinational companies. They find it very difficult to compete because they have to pay their employees far more than the big multinationals have to pay, therefore they have to put up their prices and therefore the discerning shopper will go to the cheapest place. It is a double whammy, yet when members of the Labor Party speak in this debate they don't really discuss that issue.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Labor has proposed an amendment that refers to penalty rates. I am not sure why any more Labor Party senators would want to speak because, as I understand it, the Labor Party supports this bill. They are carrying on this debate on the basis of an amendment, a proposition, dealing with penalty rates. I challenge any other speaker who might speak in this debate to show where anything I have said is wrong. Isn't it true that Bill Shorten and the Labor Party set up the Fair Work Commission? Isn't it true that the Fair Work Commission was set up to be an independent arbiter? Isn't it true that the Labor government appointed every single member of the commission who made the decision on penalty rates? Isn't it true that the adjustment of penalty rates recently announced by the Fair Work Commission was made by the Fair Work Commission set up by Labor, appointed by Labor and directed by Labor to deal with the penalty rate decision? I would be interested if anyone could show me where those facts are not correct. Don't go blaming Malcolm Turnbull; don't go blaming Senator Cash—your Fair Work Commission have done this, and they are only mirroring the enterprise agreements that many of your union supporters have made with big business in Australia.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">
                    <a href="HZB" type="MemberSpeech">
                      <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Senator BILYK</span>
                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Tasmania</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">19:09</span>):  Once again, we are in this place discussing changes to workplace relations laws and yet we haven't seen an overarching narrative from the government about what their entire intent in the area of workplace relations is. Over 1½ years have passed since the Productivity Commission report into Australia's workplace relations system was handed down, and, in what has come to be standard operating procedure for this dysfunctional government, there has been no government response to that Productivity Commission report. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The Australian public are completely in the dark about which Productivity Commission recommendations the government does or does not agree with. This coalition government does not have the courage to put a workplace relations policy to the people of Australia, because they know that the Australian people don't want to see wages cut, they don't want to see conditions cut and they don't want to see their friends, families and neighbours exploited. We just get piecemeal pieces of legislation like the Fair Work Amendment (Repeal of 4 Yearly Reviews and Other Measures) Bill, without any explanation of where they are going. They want to keep things hidden, because we know that when the coalition come clean on their workplace relations policy we get things like Work Choices. The government saw how furious Australians got with such an unfair, anti-worker change to our nation, and they saw how millions of Australians fought back and defeated the Howard government at the 2007 election. That is why they keep sniping at the workplace relations system, piece by piece. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The general proposition behind this bill to abolish the four-yearly review was agreed to by employers and unions. This bill is only a partial response to recommendation 8.1 of the Productivity Commission's report into workplace relations. Unfortunately, even though the proposition of removing four-yearly reviews was put to the government by employers and unions, it appears this bill differs from that which the employer associations and the ACTU put to the minister. The opposition notes that the changes contained in this bill are accurately described as amendments to the Fair Work Act, not reforms. But this Liberal government tries to trumpet abolishing four-yearly reviews as a reform, rather than what it is—removing a process of review from the legislation. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The opposition has been concerned to ensure that removing the four-yearly review in the manner proposed in this bill does not have unintended consequences. It is very important that modern awards can continue to be reviewed to ensure they meet the modern award objective, and that this can be done through a process where workers and employers have equal access and equal standing. This leads me to comment about the bill that is before us now. Coalition governments never really seem to care about getting workplace relations legislation right. They are just out to get the unions. I have always wondered about what drives those on the government benches to want to cut the pay and living conditions of the least well off in our society. Why do they think kicking those who have the least is the way to make society better? It is as though their reason for being is to make things harder for people already doing it tough. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">To me, this is not only immoral; it is un-Australian. Australians know that penalty rates are important to them. They are important to individuals, to families and to the wider community. People can't spend what they don't have. Cuts to penalty rates that this government did nothing to fight against will impact on up to 700,000 of Australia's lowest paid workers. We have heard that these cuts will reduce the take-home pay for some of the lowest paid and most vulnerable workers by up to $77 a week when they are fully implemented. I spoke recently to someone who had spent many years working casual jobs that had penalty rates. She told me that having or not having penalty rates is the difference between eating and not eating. She also told me that it was the difference between going to the doctor and getting medication and not going. If you are sick and you can't afford the medication, you get worse. You can't go to work and then you lose more money. It is the difference between being able to afford the necessities and going without. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I've said it before, but I honestly don't think those on the government benches have any idea how vital penalty rates are. For hundreds of thousands of Australians, penalty rates are the glue that hold their financial situation together. We know that cuts to penalty rates will not stop with the hospitality and retail awards. Penalty rates are under immediate threat from ongoing Fair Work Commission proceedings in relation to clubs, hairdressing, beauticians and restaurants. Should the cuts go ahead, a further 323,000 workers are in immediate jeopardy of having their penalty rates cut. The factors considered by the commission are not specific to the hospitality, retail, fast-food and pharmacy awards. Nurses, aged-care workers, teachers, community disability workers, cleaners and construction employees are at risk of seeing their penalty rates cut. Those opposite believe that penalty rates are only going to affect young people who are maybe studying at university and probably living at home and that it doesn't matter very much.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">United Voice Tasmania made a submission to the recent Legislative Council's select committee inquiry into growing Tasmania's economy. In it, they argue for the vital importance of penalty rates. I think it's important that we hear from those who are actually impacted by penalty rates, so I'm going to quote some of the evidence given in the United Voice submission in the short time that I've got tonight. David, who works in education, was quoted in the submission as saying:</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">I want my workplace to be a fair place for me to help provide for my young family. I … work … and study part time online at Uni. Life for me is … busy and that is not to mention my wife and kids that really need me out there working hard for them to keep them well fed, educated and entertained. I don't want to lose my penalty rates, public holidays and good hours of work that work for my family.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Ann, who works in cleaning, said:</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">It's damn hard working weekends when the rest of your family is off somewhere else without you. The money we earn is not much now, if we get lower wages how are we meant to survive? We all have bills to pay. It’s not right.</span>

                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Similarly, John, who works in security, was quoted in the submission as saying:</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Small">More and more people are being made casual and working part-time. We need the penalty rates to make ends meet.</span>

                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Darren, who works in the brewing industry, said:</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Small">The wages in Tasmania are so low, and the state government keeps increasing charges 'to bring pricing in line with the rest of Australia'. Without our penalty rates we wouldn’t be able to reside and raise our families.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Josh was quoted as saying:</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Small">I have chosen to give up weekends, Christmas and every other major holiday with my family, work night shifts, work long hours and in possible dangerous conditions. I do this for an attractive salary that can help support my family, buy our first home and pay our way. Any change to this would dramatically change everything for my family and I in a negative way. So please, leave us to work hard and earn our wage. Don’t let us make sacrifices for time … for money just to have that taken away.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">

                  <span class="HPS-Small">I will lose my house. I have a budget and it’s the wage I get now that I live on. I like to see you live on what I get.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Finally, Carol, who works in cleaning, outlined how penalty rates allow her to care for others. She said:</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">I work an average of 20 hours per week, for the minimum wage, half of those hours are on the weekend and attract penalty rates. I work this way instead of the 9 to 5 Monday to Friday employment I used to have (at a higher hourly rate) because I have a foster child with medical issues and a widowed mother with 97% hearing loss. If you would like me to send the foster child back and leave my mother to rely on social services while I work more hours to make up for the loss of penalty rates, go for it…</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Those are just a few examples.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I don't believe that we should make things more difficult for our lowest paid workers, but that's what's happened under this government. Once again, we're dealing with legislation which hasn't entirely been thought through. Labor will be putting forward amendments to this bill to get it right, but, at the end of the day, it's clear that, through their words and deeds, the government do not care about working Australians at all; they just pretend to.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">
                  <a href="I0V" type="MemberSpeech">
                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Senator WILLIAMS</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">New South Wales</span>—<span class="HPS-MinisterialTitles">Nationals Whip in the Senate</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">19:21</span>):  Australia has always produced very good surfers. We have grown up with names like Mark Richards, Midget Farrelly, Nat Young, Tom Carroll, Mick Fanning, Joel Parkinson, Steph Gilmore, Pam Burridge and Layne Beachley. These people were household names who travelled the world taking on the big surfing contests against the top surfers from countries like Brazil and the USA. In the early days we would hear of their exploits on the radio news or read about it in the papers. But as television evolved we saw more footage on the news, and today we can sit in our lounge rooms and watch these daredevils take on the monster waves—crazy, but very brave.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Unless you are in the surfing world, you might not know that in the Tweed area of the north coast of New South Wales there is the Hurley Surfing Australia High Performance Centre. A block of land at Casuarina was kindly donated by Don O'Rorke, and that is where the existing centre stands. Stage 1 was completed in 2012, stage 2 was completed in 2013 and stage 3 was completed in 2015. The first three stages cost $4.73 million in total, with financial contributions from the Australian government, Surfing Australia and the Australian Institute of Sport.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Last Tuesday I was honoured to be the Australian government representative at the official sod-turning for stage 4 of the Hurley Surfing Australia High Performance Centre. Earlier in August, the Minister for Regional Development, Senator Nash, had announced the centre was one of three projects in the Richmond electorate that received funding in round one of the $500 million Building Better Regions Fund—a great program, Senator Nash! The surfing centre received $2.53 million from the Australian government towards the project cost of $5.6 million, with the New South Wales government contributing $3 million and Surfing Australia $100,000. I was in elite company at the event at Casuarina. The ceremony was hosted by 1978 world surfing champion Wayne 'Rabbit' Bartholomew, and it was an honour to meet and chat with Layne Beachley AO, who has won the women's world championship a staggering seven times. Layne is now chair of Surfing Australia. Stage 4 will be constructed on an adjoining block. It will include amongst other things a gymnasium, an 80-seat auditorium, an indoor skate ramp, additional accommodation and an 18-car basement car park. It will more than triple the size of the existing centre, which has been built in various stages in 2012, 2013 and 2015.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">When we think of surfing, we think of carefree days out on the board just having fun. But at a professional level there is so much more that goes into it, including fitness, aerobics and diet. Surfing will make its debut at the Tokyo Olympics in 2020 and this centre at Casuarina will be an official Australian Olympic Committee training centre. The Surfing Australia team, headed by Layne Beachley and CEO Andrew Stark, will identify and work with the best talent in the hope of securing gold in Tokyo. But the centre will also cater for the recreational surfer market and visiting domestic and international teams.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">One of the real strengths of the Building Better Regions Fund is the benefit to the economy. During the construction of stage 4, which started last Wednesday, 120 jobs will be created, and there will be 55 ongoing jobs. I look forward to seeing the latest stage completed by July next year, and we will be cheering on our elite surfers in Tokyo.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">There was a tinge of sadness when we gathered at Casuarina, because just the day before we had learnt of the death of ironman legend Dean Mercer on the Gold Coast. Dean was a two-time Australian champion and World Oceanman series winner. He was only 47 years of age and was still actively involved in coaching. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Just a couple of days before that, we heard the shock news of the passing of legendary sports commentator Drew Morphett OAM. I wonder how many people knew his real name was Andrew Kenneth Morphett. Drew's voice became familiar to millions of Australian sports fans through his three decades of commentary on ABC radio and television and, later, commercial television. His sports-calling career covered AFL, test cricket, golf, basketball, horseracing and a variety of sports over four Olympic Games. If you listened to Drew's commentary, or watched the 1980s show he hosted called <span style="font-style:italic;">The Winners</span>, on ABC TV, as I did, you would think he was born to the game of Aussie Rules. But in fact he grew up in Sydney and only learnt about Australian football when he moved to Perth. He brought enthusiasm to the commentary box and he was much loved across the sporting landscape, as evidenced by the many tributes to him.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">In Dean Mercer and Drew Morphett, Australia lost a champion sportsman and a champion broadcaster. In their own ways, they gave millions of people great enjoyment.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">
                  <a href="M0R" type="MemberSpeech">
                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Senator SINGH</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Tasmania</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">19:26</span>):  I rise to speak on a matter close to my heart and to my home state of Tasmania. As the Antarctic research season approaches, it is time for Minister Frydenberg to stand up for Tasmanian scientists and climate science.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">This summer will represent the 70th anniversary of Australia's official Antarctic Program. Australia, under former Labor Prime Minister Bob Hawke, was a key actor in the creation of the Madrid protocol, the global treaty that protects the Antarctic from mining. With over 14 million square kilometres protected from mining, this was the biggest conservation decision in our history. Through this treaty and Australia's diplomatic efforts, we have protected and promoted scientific investigation and the international exchange of scientific ideas, prevented the environmental exploitation of Antarctica and ensured the non-militarisation of the continent. Australian scientists based in Hobart have provided world-leading research in Antarctic climate and weather systems. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Yet, as the damage and challenges from human-induced climate change increase, the Australian Antarctic Division is in the middle of a crisis because of this Turnbull government, which has pushed the Australian Antarctic Division to the brink by pursuing further cuts to the division. It is disgraceful that Australia's premier Antarctic scientific research division is now just 'barely functioning'. Australia's primary activity in Antarctica ostensibly revolves around science, but the government's continued cuts mean that Australia's claim to leadership in polar science is melting—fast. Hobart's climate science hub, based out of the CSIRO and the AAD, has been gutted by both the Abbott and the Turnbull governments. Their lack of commitment to climate science and the role the Antarctic plays in mitigating global warming is extremely disappointing.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">According to portfolio budget statements, average employment numbers at the AAD have dropped from 415 in 2012-13, when Labor was in government, to an anticipated 378 in the most recent statement of 2017-18. This reduction puts a huge strain across the division and severely reduces its capacity to meet its responsibilities. If the AAD is to maintain its role of leading the Australian Antarctic Program, it needs to be adequately resourced and staffed. Australia should be leading the world's climate research, not cutting jobs year on year.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The Community and Public Sector Union, which represent AAD employees, painted a bleak picture of the situation in their submission to the current Joint Standing Committee on the National Capital and External Territories inquiry into Australia's Antarctic territory. They quoted an employee, who said:</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Small">The … Division is exhausted. I've been here for 30 years and I didn't think it could get worse, but it's worse this year.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">How things have changed since the days of Bob Hawke's leadership on Antarctica. The government's cuts threaten Tasmania's status as a hub of scientific knowledge and research. Without appropriate funding, the AAD has no option but to scale back even further its activities and its commitment to climate science. This is an absolute national disgrace. The Turnbull government must fully restore funding to the AAD. It must start to support climate science and Tasmania's Antarctic scientists. It must commit to long-term funding that ensures Australia's climate research remains significant and respected, both here nationally and around the globe. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">So, on behalf of Tasmania's remaining scientists, I challenge Minister Frydenberg to take a stand. Stop cutting jobs and invest in climate science rather than spruiking coal. Make a difference, Minister Frydenberg—make a difference instead of hunting headlines. Invest in climate science, invest in Tasmania and, indeed, my home town of Hobart as a science hub through the CSIRO and the AAD being properly funded. Stop walking away from climate science and our commitments to address global warming. </span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">
                  <a href="e5z" type="MemberSpeech">
                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Senator SIEWERT</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Western Australia</span>—<span class="HPS-MinisterialTitles">Australian Greens Whip</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">19:31</span>):  This evening I rise to speak on the aged care homeless supplement, which enables specialist homeless aged care providers to provide aged care services to older Australians with a history of or risk of homelessness. The homelessness supplement, initially the transitional homeless supplement, was announced in June 2013 and commenced on 1 October 2013. The homeless supplement was a recommendation of the report of the Senate Community Affairs Legislation Committee on the Living Longer, Living Better aged care reform package. The supplement was negotiated as part of the Living Longer, Living Better aged care reform package as it went through parliament, and I am proud to say I was heavily involved in those negotiations. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The supplement was introduced to assist specialist homeless providers to remain financially viable and enable them to continue to provide aged care services to this disadvantaged cohort of older Australians. Unlike mainstream providers, specialist providers have a reduced ability to recover costs from residents, as they do not have the capacity to pay. This means that there is an inequality on the revenue side of the equation for these specialist homeless aged care providers. That, of course, is what the homeless supplement is supposed to assist with. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Unfortunately, the financial viability of specialist aged care homeless services is again at risk as the gap between mainstream providers and specialist aged care providers has once again grown. It is currently at $11 per day. It is worth noting here that prior to the introduction of what is called the Aged Care Funding Instrument, commonly known as ACFI, these specialist providers received comparable funding to the mainstream providers under the previous funding system, which is the Resident Classification Scale. The introduction of the ACFI negatively impacted on homeless aged care providers. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We need to ensure that these providers are supported to continue the critical role they play within the aged care sector. Without them, more than 1,300 homeless residents who are supported by these providers will be faced with an uncertain future. Such providers have no additional capacity to withstand any further transition of costs from the Commonwealth to the consumer under the user-pays model. Instead, they need additional resources from the government to bolster their efforts. Wintringham specialist aged care estimates that if the cost of the care transferred to residents increases by one per cent per annum, the $11 funding gap will increase to $19 by 2022. They are calling for an increase of $19 to the supplement to help them tackle the growing gap and ensure their viability. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Vulnerable older Australians should be supported and not left on the streets without these vital services. Without this increase these specialist providers may be forced to close, and the government will in fact be required, somehow, to provide accommodation, support and care for these residents—I dare say at a substantially higher cost. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I would also like to briefly mention here that, while the Greens broadly support consumer directed care—and we have been on the record about that—there is a need for exemptions to be made where it is shown not to be working. One cohort that it is not working for is homeless people. Older Australians who find themselves homeless should not be disadvantaged by their circumstances. Providers like Wintringham Specialist Aged Care have managed to find a way to provide home based care to older Australians who do not have a home of their own. The government should be encouraging such providers and supporting them to continue to provide such services. I am deeply concerned that the move to consumer directed care is impacting on their ability to provide support and outreach services such that people can be very reluctant to engage with service providers. The type of outreach care and support that these specialist services provide is very important, but the current approach makes it very difficult for them to provide these services when the services are directed at individual consumers, because, in fact, they don't have these packages. I encourage the government to make an exception to consumer directed care for individuals who cannot and do not receive these individual packages and to provide homelessness agencies with funding to enable them to continue to do the excellent work they do in supporting homeless people. We encourage the government to act now to ensure that funding is made available and that services meet the needs of homeless Australians. </span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">
                  <a href="144138" type="MemberSpeech">
                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Senator PATERSON</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Victoria</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">19:36</span>):  I rise tonight to discuss a unique opportunity that Australia has been presented with by the United Kingdom's decision to leave the European Union. Firstly, I would like to commend the Turnbull government and the Minister for Trade, Tourism and Investment, Steven Ciobo, for their decisive action to begin discussions for a post-Brexit free trade agreement with the UK, putting us at the head of the queue to form closer economic relations after the Brexit referendum in June last year. But, as I suggested in the <span style="font-style:italic;">Financial Review </span>last week, we have a rare opportunity to go one step further, too. With multiple Commonwealth nations looking to sign post-Brexit trade agreements with the UK, we could also form a new global trade bloc with our closest Commonwealth allies. The Commonwealth countries which would most easily fit into this new bloc would include Canada, Australia, New Zealand and the United Kingdom—a group collectively known as CANZUK. Collectively, these four countries have a combined GDP of $6.5 trillion. They account for US$3½ trillion in global trade. It means that a CANZUK global trade bloc would be the fourth-largest economy in the world behind only the US, China and the EU. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Removing existing tariff barriers could substantially increase trade between these countries, particularly between Australia and the UK, which is currently our seventh-largest trading partner, despite the tariffs imposed by their membership of the EU Customs Union. But there are more fundamental reasons for a CANZUK trade agreement than just the collective size of our economies. Canada, Australia, New Zealand and the UK all share close political, cultural and institutional ties that are based on our shared history and values. We share common legal systems, parliamentary democracies, free market economies, respect for individual liberties, language and even head of state. It is this common history in culture and these shared institutions that have made us among the most free and prosperous nations on earth. These close ties have also provided the basis for a defence and intelligence-sharing relationship that is epitomised, along with the US, in the Five Eyes alliance. It is only appropriate that these close ties also extend to trade. The only reason it hasn't is the UK's past inability to negotiate their own trade agreements. But with article 50 already invoked, it is only a matter of time before this changes. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Unlike many multilateral trade agreements, a CANZUK agreement shouldn't require what are often long, difficult and drawn-out negotiations. This is because we already have a highly successful agreement to base it upon—the Closer Economic Relations agreement between Australia and New Zealand. The CER agreement already prohibits all tariffs and trade restrictions on goods originating in a free trade area. It contains measures to minimise market distortions such as export subsidies, and it has protocols to reduce barriers to investment such as higher screening thresholds. Rather than drafting an entirely new agreement from scratch, Australia should advocate adding Canada and the UK to the CER agreement, with only a few major changes, if required. Taking this approach would limit the need for regulatory harmonisation. This is because the CER is based on the mutual recognition of goods and occupations. This would distinguish it from the ever-closer political union of the European Union, which the British people understandably rejected last year because of the way it eroded their democratic sovereignty. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Like the CER, CANZUK would include free movement of people between the four Commonwealth countries. This may sound controversial, particularly given the role that immigration played in the Brexit referendum. But polling conducted by the Royal Commonwealth Society has shown that CANZUK freedom of movement has clear majority support in all four countries: 82 per cent support among New Zealanders, 72 per cent support among Canadians, 70 per cent support among Australians and 58 per cent among citizens of the UK. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The final reason Australia should pursue a CANZUK agreement is that it could act as a strong voice in favour of the rules-based liberal order that is under attack by populist movements, from both sides of the political aisle, around the world. Over time, this is a group which could grow. In the past week I have had many good suggestions of countries that would make logical additions to CANZUK. Getting the core building block in place first, though, makes sense. Brexit provides Australia with a unique opportunity to create deeper ties with our closest Commonwealth allies. It's an opportunity we shouldn't pass up. </span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">New South Wales</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">19:41</span>):  I rise to put on the record that this Saturday Central Coast residents will finally have the opportunity to have their say and vote in the local government elections. Following the New South Wales Liberal government's forced amalgamations and 12 months of Liberal-appointed administration, residents will finally be able to elect candidates that are accountable to them and not just to Gladys Berejiklian. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I want to put some very important remarks on the record with regard to the Save Tuggerah Lakes Party. As some residents may already know, one of the parties standing for election, in every ward, is the Save Tuggerah Lakes Party, right down to the southern part of the Central Coast. What most people don't know is that they are a puppet party set up by much discredited Wyong mayor and Liberal member Doug Eaton. The time line goes something like this. In the early 2000s Mr Eaton became a founding member of the Save Tuggerah Lakes Party. In 2008 he was nominated as the party agent. In 2010 and 2011 it was Mr Eaton who completed the financial disclosures for the party. In fact, in 2011 Mr Eaton and his political partner, Mr Greg Best, and their wives donated a combined total of $6,000 to the party. I have the public documentation here, which I will certainly make available to the public through my Facebook page so they can see the evidence about how closely aligned these two parties are. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">That donation of $6,000 to the Save Tuggerah Lakes Party by Mr Eaton and his wife, and Mr Best and his wife, made them the largest and only party donors leading into the 2012 council elections. Before that last election, Mr Eaton and Mr Best signed and witnessed the nominations of all the Save Tuggerah Lakes Party candidates. Probably the most damning evidence for this is Mr Eaton's own admission to the <span style="font-style:italic;">Central Coast Express</span><span style="font-style:italic;"></span>in 2003, where he said that at the last council elections the electoral system was such that 'a number of candidates ran in a number of political parties to deliver preferences to them'. Councillor Eaton then went on to say that Save Tuggerah Lakes was created for that reason, to create a sense that they weren't the Liberal Party, that they were something else. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Everybody loves the Tuggerah Lakes—but I don't know that Mr Eaton and Mr Best love and want to save Tuggerah Lakes. They're more into saving their own political skins and pretending their independence from this party is a reality. They need to come clean with the people on the coast, and so does the Save Tuggerah Lakes Party. Many on the Central Coast would recall that as mayor Mr Eaton championed a number of failed projects—most notably the very discredited $500 million supposedly job-creating Chinese theme park development in Wyong. This has been roundly condemned as never ever having been fit for development in documents recently tabled in the New South Wales parliament. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Recently, Mr Eaton was referred to the Independent Commission Against Corruption on allegations of using his council position for his own financial benefit. It has also been alleged, and much aired in local media, by a council whistleblower, that, as mayor, Mr Eaton ordered his staff to prepare his own Order of Australia medal nomination, including typing up a biography that he had provided handwritten. Earlier this year, Mr Eaton ran as an unsuccessful Liberal council candidate in Wyong and now stands as an Independent. Let's be clear, when an Independent isn't independent, when they're aligned with a political party, it is a deception.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I want to put on the record that Labor is transparently supporting Labor candidates. We know that Doug Eaton is not shy of controversy. He represents the local government culture of wheeling and dealing that locals are absolutely sick of. Many on the Central Coast will have a choice on Saturday between an old council culture that puts deals first and ratepayers last or a new team that transparently reveals who they are and what they stand for. For all those who are voting Independent, I really urge you to make sure that the people are genuinely independent, not tied up with this preference flow to the Liberal Party, which has been the case for more than 20 years on the Central Coast. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Labor will clean up the mess. Labor will get on with the building of roads to improve our lives, the building of footpaths and the provision of services for our community. We've got young people with great vision on our team, and we've older people—like Jeff Sundstrom, local firefighter—ready to stand up for our local community. Vote Labor, and support our council on Saturday.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">New South Wales</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">19:46</span>):  People take up political careers for many reasons. Some do it for reasons of service, for humanity; others do it for the headlines and yet others do it because up until then they've led a solitary existence. If not for noble reasons, they should be held in contempt. This might be a bit cryptic for some to understand. There's going to be an explanatory follow-up a little later on. Some will get it; some will not. This speech is titled 'citizen of convenience' as it will highlight that some people, and a particular individual, are using the circumstances of the 45th Parliament purely to further their own personal agenda and not the agenda of the people of Australia.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">In light of the dual citizenship fiasco, there's been one person at least who has attempted to manipulate the situation to be more about putting the spotlight on themselves than on resolving this debacle. In the public domain, they have claimed to be a UK citizen by descent, but they were born elsewhere—not Australia nor the UK. Have they renounced their UK citizenship or was their original claim just a lie? If we were to take their statements prior to them entering parliament at face value, they wouldn't have a passport and wouldn't be here—or were those statements lies too?</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">You might think that by saying this I'm being a wally. But hopefully my message will ring true and people's damaged reputations will be legally restored. Certainly there will be a legal process that will decide the outcome of events over the next few years one way or the other. The haze will be removed. The citizenship issue will be settled and there may be fewer people in this place or the other place—or just different people. Leaving here in disgrace can be short-circuited by leaving before you get exposed. You won't need to go sniffing around the bins. You'll no doubt be able to get some form of social security.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">
                  <span style="font-style:italic;" />I don't have to be pulling money to and from my accountant's bank in the nick of time to avoid being caught out or put in financial straits, nor do I need to rip off charities. I just dip into my own pocket when I want to put on the nose bag and enjoy a feast. I don't rort the system, and I don't encourage others to either. I'm not going to tar people with mendacious comments. That would not be ethical, nor would it be the honourable thing to do. The honourable thing to do would be to jump before being pushed. The noose will be tightening around this person's neck soon, and perhaps their head will be small enough to put on a slouch hat. Perhaps their next job will be selling chocolates for charity on <span style="font-style:italic;">The Footy Show.</span></span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">

                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Senator KAKOSCHKE-MOORE</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">South Australia</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">19:49</span>):  In remote communities in this country, a household would be lucky to have just five books. It's hard to imagine if you've grown up in a household where you were read to from the start of your life, were scolded by your parents as a young child because you hadn't switched the lights out, your head stuck in a book, or as an adult when you long for some time to read a good novel. The fact is that a household comprising adults and children who cannot read sees no need for books. Besides that, how does one get a book in remote Australia? If you can get a book and you can read, the chances that the story is about your own people, culture and traditions are very slim.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Tomorrow, 6 September, is Indigenous Literacy Day, a national celebration of Indigenous culture, stories, language and literacy. On Indigenous Literacy Day, attention is focused on the disadvantages experienced in remote communities, and Australians are encouraged to raise funds and advocate for more equal access to literacy resources for remote communities. While the day is a celebration, and there is much to celebrate—which I will come to—the fact remains that a national day is dedicated to raising funds and awareness to drive more equitable access to basic literacy for our nation's first peoples.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">There has been progress, but nowhere near enough. The <span style="font-style:italic;">Closing the </span><span style="font-style:italic;">g</span><span style="font-style:italic;">ap: Prime Minister's </span><span style="font-style:italic;">r</span><span style="font-style:italic;">eport 2017</span> admits this. While we celebrate the successes, we cannot shy away from the stark reality that we are not seeing significant national progress on the Closing the Gap targets, as Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull says in the report. One such target is to halve the gap for Indigenous children in reading, writing and numeracy within a decade. The problem with this target—the sad reality—is that this year is the ninth year in which the Closing the Gap report was released, and the decade therefore started nine years ago. By 2018 we won't have even halved the gap.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">But what does that gap look like? It is just a quarter of Indigenous year 5 students in very remote areas being at or above national minimum reading standards, compared with 91 per cent for non-Indigenous students, according to the 2016 NAPLAN. It is Indigenous 15-year-olds being on average about two and a third years behind non-Indigenous 15-year-olds in reading, literacy and mathematical literacy. It is less opportunity for an enriching and rewarding life for Indigenous Australians, blocked pathways to study and employment, higher rates of suicide, disproportionately higher rates of incarceration, and a shorter life expectancy. It is less than five books in family homes in remote countries, according to the Indigenous Literacy Foundation.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">As a nation we must do more, and we can do more. The Indigenous Literacy Foundation, started by Suzy Wilson, an educator and bookshop owner, has grown tremendously since 2007. It has raised more than $7 million, without government funding. Its Book Supply Program gifts new, culturally appropriate books to more than 250 remote Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander communities and organisations across Australia. More than 48,700 books have been given out. The Book Buzz program encourages reading and engagement with books for children under five, and their families. It provides quality board books, resources and facilities and translations of books into the first language. The community literacy projects are supporting people in remote communities to write, illustrate and publish books, some of which reflect traditional legends and stories. Many are written by children and reflect multiple Australian Indigenous languages.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The Indigenous Literacy Foundation, supported by employees, volunteers and well-known patrons and ambassadors, including the Hon. Quentin Brice, popular children's author Andy Griffiths and Indigenous singer, songwriter and actress Jessica Mauboy, is fostering a love of reading but, most importantly, it is improving the literacy skills of children.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The impact of the foundation's work is profound. Teachers in remote communities report seeing strong increases in their reading development data, books bringing families together and facilitating connections with educators and the families of their children, and encouraging a sense of feeling safe, while promoting children's literacy skills and overall development and wellbeing. Is it any wonder, though, when beautiful, brand-new books that speak the language of these communities, telling the tales of the land and their people, are being created and distributed to kids, who want to see themselves in the books—kids who want to belong? As the Indigenous Literacy Foundation says, 'Books open doors.' We must urgently remove the doorstop and give Indigenous children the equal opportunities they deserve.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">New South Wales</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">19:54</span>):  Yesterday in <span style="font-style:italic;">The</span><span style="font-style:italic;">Australian Financial Review </span>James Fazzino, the managing director and chief executive of Incitec, had an article in which he explained why his Australian company built its factory in the United States rather than in Australia. It makes sobering reading. His comparison of Australia and the US very effectively summarised the growing failings of Australia as a place to do business. Mr Fazzino observed that, in contrast to Australia, in the US business is made to feel welcome. His company built a world-class billion-dollar ammonia factory in Louisiana on time and on budget. And, he noted, Louisiana has environmental and regulatory standards equal to if not higher than Australia's. Incitec gained approval for the project in six months. By comparison, it took three years for Costco to simply get zoning approval to open their first warehouse in Victoria. The key was that authorities in Louisiana worked overtime to expedite approval deadlines to meet the business's needs. Incitec had looked at developing a similar project in New South Wales, but the barriers and bureaucracy meant that there was simply no comparison, and the project did not proceed. Incitec found that the approvals process for its proposed plant in New South Wales took three years. In that time it was able to gain approval, build and even begin commercial operations in Louisiana.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">With the benefit of firsthand experience in both the US and Australia, Mr Fazzino identified three key areas where Australia is killing off projects, along with their associated jobs and prosperity: bureaucracy, workplace productivity and energy costs. First, he identified that bureaucracy in Australia worked at a snail's pace in comparison with the US, with no sense of concern for the success of projects. Second, labour costs and productivity were so uncompetitive that construction costs of a similar plant in Australia would have been 40 to 50 per cent higher. And remember that Australia suffers a huge gap between labour costs and the actual wages that workers receive, because of the red tape and tax involved in hiring them. Third, Mr Fazzino cited Australia's spiralling energy costs, in particular the cost of gas, now nearly seven times what Incitec pays in the US.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">This case of the billion-dollar ammonia plant that New South Wales lost to Louisiana is a perfect illustration of where we are going wrong as a nation: labyrinthine bureaucracy plus governments that are suspicious of or even outright hostile to business; workplace regulations that make our workers less productive; and energy prices that are a legacy of active discouragement by state and federal governments of investment in reliable new generation capacity. Too many in this country see business as the enemy and fail to recognise the link between productivity and employment.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Around 30 years ago a book called <span style="font-style:italic;">Australia and Argentina</span><span style="font-style:italic;">: O</span><span style="font-style:italic;">n Parallel Paths</span> was published. This book drew attention to the fact that Argentina, the quintessential banana republic, long associated with coups, dictatorships, runaway inflation and economic crises, was once a very prosperous and stable democracy. At the beginning of the 20th century it was suggested that Argentina might rival the United States for economic domination of the new world. But instead of capitalising on it, the country's successes were squandered by a populist, left-wing ideologue demagogue, Juan Peron, who, along with his successors, picked the fruits of liberal capitalism in order to buy the votes he needed to destroy it. As <span style="font-style:italic;">On Parallel Paths</span> pointed out, 30 years after Argentina, Australia had its own Peron, called Gough Whitlam, and the vote buying, bureaucratic stifling of business and pursuit of grandiose, feel-good schemes, each of which he pioneered, are still with us. Let's hope the Australian people wake up to the failure and fraud of the populist enemies of liberal democracy sooner than Argentina, before our political stability and economic future follow a similar path. <span style="font-style:italic;">(Time expired)</span></span>

From Brisbane it is 1,581 kilometres; from Melbourne, 2,158 kilometres; from Adelaide, 1,170 kilometres and from Darwin, 2,283 kilometres. I emphasise the distance from these major cities because I joined around 8,000 racegoers over the weekend who made the trek from cities and regional towns from across the country in their four-wheel drives, planes and coaches to revel in the annual Birdsville Races, held on the first Saturday of September. </span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">What's in Birdsville? Not a great deal. But, as the old saying goes: it's not the size that matters. Birdsville boasts one of this country's most iconic pubs, the Birdsville Hotel—a pub that was gutted by fire and lovingly restored by its current owners. Then, there is the Birdsville Bakery, where you will find the equally iconic camel pies, and hordes of people queued outside the door for a wholesome feed. I have to point out, it's one of the only bakeries I know of in the country that can serve a steak and pepper pie and a can of XXXX.</span>

Then there's the one-man police station and plenty of red dust. These locals form the backbone of Birdsville. With makeshift tent cities both sides of the river and a warm welcome 'howdy' or a wave as you walk past the tents, this is home for the next few nights. It doesn't matter who you are and how big your bank balance is, everyone camps. Pre-races each day, four-wheel drives tackle Big Red, a rich red sand dune. It will cost you $1,000 to recover your car if you can't meet the challenge. I decided to walk up the dune just in case.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">With races on Friday and Saturday, there is no shortage of bookies in the undercover area, and punters that cling to any bit of shade and their cold beer. Birdsville dishes up some of the harshest conditions that Australia has to offer, yet it draws this massive crowd. When the sun sets, the party intensifies. With clear star-like skies, the backdrop of food vans and Brophy's boxing tent, the closed off streets become one giant beer garden and literally anything goes. I know; I was there. I was actually card girl and judging the boxing. What an experience it was in my life, and it goes into my memory bank. The sounding drumbeat signals a call for budding amateur boxers to muster the courage to take on Fred Brophy's troupe. It is as pivotal to the Birdsville Races as the cup itself. This is the world's last travelling boxing troupe, with a bloke by the name of Fred Brophy who beats the drum 15 feet above the thousands who gather to watch the show. The accompanying ringing of the bell pays tribute to past and present boxers who've helped create the icon. It never ceases to amaze me how many people line up at each show to take on the troupe.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The Birdsville Races are an event you have to experience to fully understand. They truly are a bucket list event—a cross between Munich's beer festival, the Melbourne Cup and the recent Jeff Horn match. To the countless volunteers who marshal the aircraft in and out over the weekend, the jockeys, race organisers like Garry Brook, food stall operators who tow their caravans across the desert, Fred and Sandy Brophy, his boxers, the paramedics and police who come from far and wide to help, the tow truck operators who pull stranded cars off Big Red and the thousands of people who made the trip this year: thank you. Lastly, a final farewell to a bloke I have got to know over the last number of years, who boxed in Fred Brophy's tent—Digger. In all the fights I have watched you box with that cheeky smile; it will be sadly missed from the ring. You finally joined the list of icons painted on the canvass facade of the tent. I can picture Fred asking the crowd to give you a rally as he hypes the thousands that gather out the front of next year's event.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">
                  <a href="266524" type="MemberSpeech">
                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Senator ROBERTS</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Queensland</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">20:04</span>):  As a servant to the people of Queensland and Australia, and all communities in Cape York, it is my duty to listen to and meet as many people as possible across our home state. One of the privileges of representing the people of Queensland is travelling across our state, whether it be Cape York in the north, the south-west, or all regions in between. Last week I was privileged to visit Cape York and listen to many people across nine days and across all communities, with the exception of Aurukun, which was closed for sorry business, due to two fatalities. Although I've been to the cape many times—in fact, four times over the last 35 years—I have so much more to learn. The cape is a beautiful, pristine, varied wilderness, untamed, wild and unpredictable, yet loved and cherished by all its people. It's home to a variety of everyday Aussies who have to battle the rigours of distance, Mother Nature, remote location, lack of services and small population to together make a shared future.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Mateship and care for each other are key to survival on the cape. Looking out for each other is an ethos. People work together on the cape with respect. The terms 'blackfellas' and 'whitefellas' are used with respect and signify not skin colour but culture and background, respectfully and often affectionately. Yet more than one person said to me that to fail in the cape is catastrophic. It can be so isolated and remote that, when in strife, failure can mean death. It doesn't help, then, that various institutions, such as the federal government bureaucrats from Canberra, state government bureaucrats from places like West End, and the loathed and despised Greens locking up their country, stick their noses into cape business and make the perilous life in Cape York even harder. They jeopardise peoples' livelihoods and futures.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Paternalism is one danger Indigenous Australians complained about constantly across the cape. Being told by taxpayer funded agencies and Aboriginal elites from outside the cape—the new powers that be—how to run their lives in the communities is severely disheartening. It stops choice, and stopping choice destroys responsibility. Canberra or Brisbane cannot create a single policy that would assist any Australian small-business person to start an enterprise and provide employment. All over the cape, people are crying out for autonomy. Sure, the churches and state governments that removed people from communities and their families a hundred years ago were well meaning, yet they did damage. Churches damaged, governments damaged, and then government welfare, 50 or 60 years ago, did damage. As many Aboriginals now freely say, governments damaged.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Now we have Aboriginals in cape communities telling us that a new group of Aboriginal elites outside the cape control taxpayer funded agencies that choke Aboriginal communities. Aboriginal elites damage. Locals tell us that a few Aboriginal elites in the Far North have hijacked Indigenous issues and are on a fat money grab. People repeatedly told us these modern elites siphon money from those that need it. They're seizing control of the cape, locking it up, and seizing control of peoples' lives, choking peoples' spirit and futures. For example, one Aboriginal council CEO told us about $50 million that was promised for Indigenous housing in his community, but after the middlemen, the consultants and the heads of government agencies took their slice, only $26 million was spent on housing—half!</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Far North Queensland is an expensive place to do business, and economic opportunities—pastoral, agricultural, mining, cultural or tourism—will not survive there unless we set the cape and its people free. Getting government out of the lives of individuals and businesspeople on the cape is crucial to the cape's success. People are hungry to seize opportunities for economic development, social development and community development. Local communities want to restore culture and connection. People want a fair go. My firm commitment to the people of the cape is this: One Nation will be your champion. With people like Jen Sackley, the One Nation candidate for Cook, our party will fight for the cape and work our hardest to give everyone in our wild north a fair share. All the people on the cape want is to be heard and get a fair go.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">
                  <a href="247871" type="MemberSpeech">
                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Senator O'SULLIVAN</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Queensland</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">20:09</span>):  I rise tonight to reflect upon the life of a friend and fellow political traveller in Alexander Rodney Lockie Wilson, known affectionately to all as Rod Wilson. Rod passed away less than a week ago. He was a pastoralist, a cattleman of serious note, having built very substantial interests in that sector with his wife, Sylvia, and members of their family. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Rod was a political activist. I had known him for more than 35 years. He was a fellow traveller. Rod was a giant within the movement of the National Party of Australia, both at our state level in the state of Queensland and at a national level. He was a community leader, having resided in the Callide and Central Queensland area for most of his life. Rod and his family, including extended family, have made enormous contributions to those communities over that period of time. He also provided very clear leadership over the decades in agripolitics as well as general politics. I have memories of any number of speeches or groupings and activities organised by Rod in his capacity as one of our leaders in that part of our state. His influence was enormous. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Rod was a very fair and measured individual who had a very practical and very, very acute political intellect. He demonstrated often that he was before his time in work that he had done around issues that we now refer to as workplace health and safety. Long before that, the people who worked for him and Sylvia and their family, and indeed members of the broader community, were in the core of his mind as he developed measures and practices around pastoral enterprises that he owned with an emphasis on improving the safety and working conditions of those people. He was responsible for many innovative designs and process changes that have been adopted by so many in that industry. He was a pioneer in developing the use of hydraulic mechanisms that were used in double-decker cattle trucks so that cattle on the top deck could be loaded and unloaded safely using that system. He also had done a bit of work using some innovative engineering adjustments around the design of windmills. I know a number of my colleagues here and those who are not present have had to do the laborious job of pulling bores. Rod designed features around bores and windmills that made that job so much safer. He was an early adopter, for example, with the use of solar energies and retrofitted bores at great expense very early when that innovation of the use of solar pumps and solar energy came into the marketplace for use in pastoral pursuits. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">With his wife, Sylvia, Rod built what I think could be referred to as a cattle empire with their daughters, Zoe and Eliza, and their son, William, and their broader family. Rod always acknowledged the contribution of the people who worked with him. They had built a very substantial business, and very frequently, being blessed with those things that come with being a successful businessman, Rod would reinvest not just his time and energy but also financially in the community. And there were other pursuits where he and Sylvia shared the goodness of life that they'd been blessed with.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Rod will be remembered as an individual who had great strength of character. He was a tall and quite imposing man, quietly spoken and very measured. His intellect and intelligence were often very evident in the delivery of his arguments, which were always well structured and very persuasive. Rod was a man who did his homework on issues. He thoroughly understood his subject matter before he put forward his arguments. He will be remembered also for his integrity and his honesty. He and Sylvia, and their entire family, were enormously respected in the communities in which they lived, which I referred to earlier.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Rod also had a great sense of humour. When his darling twin daughters, Zoe and Eliza, were born, he put an ad in <span style="font-style:italic;">Queensland Country Life</span> in which he referred to 'welcoming two spring heifers'. Sylvia, I understand, has never forgiven him for that, but nonetheless it was entirely consistent with Rod's way of life and his sense of humour. He will be remembered as a giant of a man and he will be remembered for his contribution and serious influence around state and national agricultural policy. He was a leader in the field, and for my party, the National Party of Australia, he was responsible for building and maintaining a very significant presence in Central Queensland. He had great influence and was very respected by our political movement there.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">If I had had the opportunity, which I did not, to ask Rod how he would like to be remembered, I am quite certain that his answer would have been very simple. He would have wanted to be remembered, clearly, as a very good and sound member of his community through life, but he also would have wanted to be remembered as the magnificent husband, father, and grandfather to eight grandchildren that he was. He is missed greatly by members of the Calliope and Central Queensland community. He is missed greatly by members of the inaugural National Party of Queensland and the National Party of Australia. He will be remembered for his legacy of policies and initiatives that he drove and nurtured over many years. It's only been in recent months that Rod, very unwell and battling a condition that eventually overtook him, rang me about labour reforms in agriculture—about how people who would otherwise have difficulty getting employment because of age or disability might be accommodated by changes in policy that would make it easier for them to be employed.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Rod, you will be well remembered for all the things that I have spoken about and much, much more. I wish Sylvia, the children, the grandchildren and Rod's extended family condolences on behalf of all of those in our political movement over a long period of time who came to know Rod and work with him. I felt it was important that a contribution as significant as his be recorded in the <span style="font-style:italic;">Hansard</span> of our federal parliament. I just hope that Sylvia and the family are able to confront Rod's loss and find peace in the knowledge of the enormous contribution that this man made to our state and, indeed, to our nation.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Tasmania</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">20:19</span>):  I rise tonight to speak about two local organisations that I've had the pleasure of visiting in the last few weeks. They are both world leaders and making an impact in my home state of Tasmania: Home of Hope, in Meander, and Hillwood Berry Farm. They are two very different but equally successful organisations. The first Tasmanian organisation I want to speak about tonight is the development Home of Hope, in Meander in Northern Tasmania, which has been facilitated by Teen Challenge Tasmania. I would particularly like to place on record my thanks to Executive Director Tanya Cavanagh and Director Peter Ferrall for their warm hospitality and their willingness to share their vision with me.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Teen Challenge Tasmania is seeking funding and support to develop the former Meander Primary School site into the Home of Hope, a 28-bed non-denominational 12-to-18-month residential alcohol and other drug rehabilitation home. The objective of the home is to provide women with children, pregnant women and single women suffering from addictions access to a safe, stable environment. Home of Hope isn't just about the addiction; it's also about rebuilding self-image, personal skills and relationships. There currently isn't anything like this in Tasmania and the community would greatly benefit from this initiative.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Teen Challenge Tasmania has an agreement to lease the property in its current form from the owners, the Meander Valley Council, for 15 years. They also have permission to upgrade the facility to meet their needs so they are able to deliver these much needed services and supports. But they must cover the entire refurbishment of these premises. Quite frankly, the school does need a lot of refurbishment. But they're up to the challenge. They also have wide community support.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The Home of Hope, though, faces some other challenges. As usual, there are arguments around whether or not it is advisable to have an addiction rehabilitation centre in one's community and the fact that it's faith based. Some people in the community would prefer to see that site transformed into a community hub around cafes, doctors and the like. There is unfortunately a very small minority objecting to this project, and one person in particular who owns the land around the school is objecting to this project because of his own self-interest. As always, these things do tend to come down to money. With drug and alcohol addiction on the rise, there most certainly is a need for this facility in Tasmania. It is vital for women to have access to evidence based and tailored rehabilitation support like Home of Hope. It doesn't matter that it's faith based—it's non-denominational, and there is no-one else, as I said, stepping up to the table to provide these services.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Once Home of Hope is completed, it will follow the structure of the highly successful Global Teen Challenge program, which was originally established in New York in 1958. There are currently 1,400 Teen Challenge centres in 128 countries around the world. The program that they will be instigating, ensuring that it follows the Global Teen Challenge program internationally, has a fantastic success rate of 86 per cent. That is staggering. As we know, there are always those people who have to act as mentors. I'd like to mention the fact I was able to meet Jeremy, a young man who had been through the Teen Challenge himself. He has been through one of their rehabilitation programs and he is now giving back to the community. He said, 'I want others to learn from my mistakes.' That's why he's being a mentor in Meander.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">But this would not have even got to this stage without the driving force of Mrs Christine Chilcott. She is so well known in Northern Tasmania, particularly in the Meander and the Deloraine communities. She is such a strong advocate for her community, and it was fantastic that she was able to make herself available to meet with me as well. The passion I see that she has for this centre will carry this, I think, so that ultimately the Meander and surrounding community will be fully supportive of this. Again, I would like to place on the record—because it is not easy to go into a community and establish such a centre—my congratulations to Tanya, to Pete and, in particular, to Jeremy; and of course to Christine Chilcott.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The other organisation that I met with, as I said, was the Hillwood Meander berry farm. Tasmania has always led the country in agriculture because it has the world-class soil and climate necessary for producing high-quality natural produce. Tasmanian farmers and primary producers have made quite a name for themselves, and, it doesn't matter where you travel in the world, people know Tasmania for our fine food and wines and our pristine environment. Meander Valley and Hillwood berries are no exception. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Meander Valley Berries and Hillwood Berry Farm were two separate entities, up until two years ago, when Meander acquired Hillwood. I was fortunate to meet with the man behind Meander Valley Berries and now Hillwood berries, Simon Dornauf, to talk to him about the business model, and the opportunities and challenges that he faces. Businesses like Meander Valley Berries and Hillwood in rural areas of Tasmania are often not given credit for the contribution that they make not only to agriculture but by employing local Tasmanians and giving opportunities to others to have that experience. But they are also community leaders and they are essential to our rural and regional communities.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Tasmania's agricultural sector is booming. It creates lots of local jobs. It has opened up Tasmania's doors and has the potential to increase our global exports. There is currently a $150 million farmgate turnover in berries in Tasmania per annum. That is $150 million just in Tasmanian berries. Agriculture is a key pillar of our economy and will be an important driving force in Tasmania's future growth. There is no denying that there are still big opportunities there. We now have international companies that are investing in our agricultural industries. Most people in this chamber would recognise the brand Driscoll's. When you're eating your next handful of berries, whether they're blueberries, strawberries or raspberries, there's a strong likelihood most of them have been grown in Northern Tasmania.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We know that the Dornauf family is well connected when it comes to the berry industry. Those who have visited the Christmas Hills Raspberry Farm, at Elizabeth Town in Northern Tasmania, know the success of that business. They have turned that from growing and producing into a tourism icon for the north of the state. The innovation that has been shown by Simon in his development shows the sort of innovation that is so apparent in Tasmania. But what they need is more support. Just this year, $3 million has been invested in that business. When you consider that there are over one million plants on the property which have to be watered and tended to every day, it does create local jobs. In addition, the farm received a grant of $300,000 as part of the regional revival scheme which assisted with the crucial investment the farm needed to expand its operations. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">There are issues around getting people that want to work in this sector, and we do rely on people coming in from Pacific islands, predominantly Tonga and East Timor. Even though there are still some challenges with pay and being able to get enough local people to work in the sector because it is only a six-month season and it is labour intensive, it is invaluable to the Tasmanian community. But I wanted to tip my hat to Simon Dornauf, a young man who has shown that innovation and energy will make a successful business, no matter where you are. I commend him for the work that he's doing for his company. The amount of money that that's generating within the local community can never be underestimated. Congratulations. I wanted to share with the chamber just two of the wonderful organisations that are proving to be successful in Tasmania.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">
                  <a href="155410" type="MemberSpeech">
                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Senator RICE</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Victoria</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">20:30</span>):  On Monday, we marked Equal Pay Day in Australia. That's the date past the end of the financial year that women, on average, would have had to work to earn the same amount as men—an extra two months more work. Australian women in full-time work are paid, on average, $251 per week less than men. This is averaged out across the entire workforce, but, even when women do the exact same job as men, they are often paid less. The more the job pays, the bigger the gap. It's not because women work in low-paying industries or are less productive or less successful at bargaining. Major drivers of the gender pay gap are caused by discrimination against women where employers prefer to hire men rather than women, are more likely to reject equally qualified women or offer women less money. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Another reason is that jobs in professions predominantly staffed by women are poorly valued and poorly paid. When most employees in an industry are men, in contrast, the work tends to be considered more valuable and is compensated accordingly. Women make up the bulk of employees in undervalued, feminised industries like childcare, nursing and teaching. Women are also more likely to be working in casual or part-time positions than men. The penalty rates cut that was supported by this government targets retail and hospitality workers, the majority of whom are women. Full-time working Australian women spend, on average, 25 hours doing housework per week compared to men's 15 hours doing housework. This unequal burden on women limits their workplace participation. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The gender pay gap also can't be explained away by women taking time to raise children. It exists from the moment women enter the workforce. A woman will earn four per cent less than a man in her first graduate job. As her career progresses, the gap will increase to almost 20 per cent by the time she retires. Less pay over the course of a career also means less superannuation and, on average, women retire with almost half the superannuation of men. This can be as much as $700,000 less than men over the course of a career. This is directly responsible for the increasing poverty of far too many older women. There is a spike in the number of older women experiencing homelessness that's associated with this, with women over 55 the fastest-growing group of homeless Australians. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">What can we do about it? In Australia, we have different sets of rules in different workplaces when it comes to talking about your pay. In the private sector, it is common practice for contracts to include gag clauses that prevent workers from discussing their pay with other workers. We know that where pay is kept secret the gender pay gap is even worse. In the public sector, the gender pay gap is 12.2 per cent compared with 21.3 per cent in the private sector. The Greens have a bill before parliament to remove these gag clauses. The government says there is no place for gender discrimination in our society, yet one in five women lose their jobs on maternity leave or on returning to work. To achieve equality in the workplace, we must also encourage men to do more domestic and family labour, which requires workplaces to allow family-friendly practices for both mothers and fathers. This is good for families and for fathers. Fathers deserve to spend time with their children. In Australia, men are only granted two weeks paternity leave and most don't take it. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The Greens also have a plan for affordable childcare, including building new community childcare centres and boosting assistance for families who need it most. These are the sorts of measures that are required. We support a fair paid parental leave scheme with six months paid leave for the primary carer, up from the current allowance of 18 weeks. The Greens' better work/life balance bill expands the request for flexible working hours. We can also fight for better pay in feminised industries, like nursing and child care, and work to reverse the callous cuts to penalty rates. The gender pay gap is not just how things are. It's not inevitable. Countries like Iceland have recently made it illegal to pay women less. We can do that in Australia, too. We must continue to fight sexism in all its forms and ensure that the work of women is valued equally to men's work.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">It's very appropriate that, this Thursday, I and the Greens will be introducing a bill to scrap the Regional Forest Agreements Act, the act that underpins our outdated logging laws, the regional forest agreements. These laws have been in place for 20 years. It is these laws that are locking in destructive clear-fell logging of our native forests. Our native forests are precious. They are home to an amazing range of animals and birds. Our outdated logging laws are sending animals and birds into extinction. I can give you a very sad list of species that live in our forests that are threatened, rare, endangered and vulnerable. They live in our forests, and over the 20 years of our outdated logging laws, which have locked in clear-fell logging, their status has certainly not improved, and for many species it has got far, far worse.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">In Tasmania, where the government has just rolled over these logging laws, we have birds like swift parrots and animals like Tasmanian devils, as well as the giant freshwater crayfish and the Tasmanian wedge-tailed eagle. In Victoria there is the very well-known and critically endangered Leadbeater's possum, which lives in the critically endangered ecosystem of the Mountain Ash forests of the Central Highlands. We've got long-footed potoroos, tiger quolls, greater gliders, the masked owl and the sooty owl. We've got the large brown tree frog, the giant burrowing frog and East Gippsland galaxias—tiny little fish that live only in the forests of East Gippsland. In New South Wales, koalas are in rapid decline. And there are other species, like the Hastings River mouse. In Western Australia there are red-tailed black cockatoos; Baudin's cockatoos; the quokka, which relies on native forests; and the western ringtail possum. All these species rely on intact native forest. All these species are being threatened by the ongoing logging of our forests.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">What makes our logging laws so unacceptable is that they contain exemptions from our environment protection laws—the Environment Protection and Biodiversity Conservation Act. So, where this logging occurs, it's deemed to be ecologically responsible, regardless of the fact that all these species are on a downward trend in how healthy their populations are. Yet this government is locking that in. How will the Prime Minister tell his grandchildren that he just sat by while these precious species disappeared from Australia? The decision in early August to co-sign with the Tasmanian government a so-called variation to the regional forest agreements demonstrated just how short-sighted and irresponsible state and federal governments around the country are.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">So the Greens want to scrap these logging laws, because they allow for the ongoing destruction of our native forests. We know that the wood products industry in Australia has already largely shifted out of our native forests; 85 per cent of the wood that comes from Australia is now coming from plantations. We don't need to be continuing destructive practices in our native forests. These agreements were set up last century, and the Greens contend that they should not just be rolled over onto new 20-year agreements—basically locking in this destruction in perpetuity. It's unacceptable that this outdated way of managing our forests can be rolled over with just the flick of a pen by the Prime Minister and his state counterparts. We need 21st century forest management, scrapping the failed logging laws, shifting to a sustainable plantation based wood products industry and returning environmental protections to our native forests. The first step is to recognise that these logging laws are not protecting our forests and that they aren't protecting a long-term sustainable wood products industry.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">
                  <a href="76760" type="MemberSpeech">
                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Senator GRIFF</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">South Australia</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">20:40</span>):  I rise today to talk about the state of Australia's automotive industry. People might think that the end of car manufacturing in Australia means that this is a dying industry. In fact, the automotive industry is striving to innovate and adapt. It still employs more than 360,000 people, is worth $37 billion a year and continues to contribute over two per cent to Australia's GDP. This industry is not even close to death, but it is struggling.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">One of its main problems is a dire lack of skills. According to a report released last month by the Motor Trades Association, skills shortages within the automotive industry are at their highest level ever. Nationally, the industry currently has more than 27,000 jobs that it cannot fill. Just think about that for a minute: 27,000 jobs available right now. By next year, there will be an incredible 35,000 empty positions across the country in repair shops, car detailers, new and used car yards, tyre and spare parts retailers and vehicle manufacturers. The biggest shortage is in light vehicle mechanics. If you are finding it takes a long time to get your car booked in for a service, this might tell you why. The other badly-hit occupations include vehicle spray painters, car sales people, panel beaters and automotive electricians. If you are interested in the full list, you will find it in the MTAA's new report <span style="font-style:italic;">Directions in Australia's automotive industry: an industry report 2017</span>. At the launch of the report, the association's national CEO, Richard Dudley, revealed that a number of businesses had given up looking for spray painters two years ago because it was such a futile task. These desperate businesses had instead turned to the 457 skilled visa program's Consolidated Sponsored Occupations List. This was helping to plug the gap, until April, when the government summarily, and with no consultation with industry, decided to dump vehicle painters from the skilled migration list.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">This is a government that says it stands up for businesses, yet all it has done here is get in their way. This financial year the industry estimates there will be a shortage of almost 3,000 vehicle spray painters around Australia, and the government has tied the hands of the industry by closing off one solution to this skills shortage. There is no pathway for this occupation under any Australian skilled visas. I would like to understand the logic behind the move and the advice that led to the decision to not include spray painters on either the medium-term or long-term strategic skills list or the short-term skilled occupations list. Fortunately, at least jobs like motor mechanics, automotive electricians and panel beaters remain on the new skills list.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The reason for the skills shortages are familiar ones: mainly problems with attraction and retention. Luring the right candidates is proving to be another big issue. The MTA says there is employer disenchantment with the pool of candidates on offer. It states that unambitious students and those with learning difficulties are being steered towards the motor trades. But the industry is not looking for grease monkeys with poor school results. It actually needs students with sound STEM skills who can understand and repair modern vehicle technology.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The automotive trades are also under pressure because of dwindling numbers of new apprentices. The industry estimates it needs 14,000 new entrants each year just to balance out the industry's natural attrition rate. However, it is currently taking on only just under 11,000 apprentices and trainees a year, so you can see that this situation can only become worse unless action is taken. The soon to be introduced apprenticeship mentoring scheme, brought about by my lobbying to government, will go some way to helping alleviate the shortages. The scheme is modelled on the Australian Apprenticeship Mentoring Program, which ran from 2011 to 2013. The program was scrapped for the sake of short-term budget issues. It ignored the fact that the program actually helped industries improve their apprentice completion rates. In the two years it operated, over 3,000 apprentices and trainees were mentored nationally.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The program helped 84 per cent of apprentices continue their training. In my home state of South Australia, completion rates for motor trades apprentices surged from an industry average of around 50 per cent to over 90 per cent under this program. Ninety per cent—that is an incredibly strong result. The Motor Trades Association in South Australia told me that, after the program ended, completion rates dropped once again to roughly one in two apprentices emerging with a qualification. The program was focused on apprentices in their first year of training, when they were most at risk of quitting. It was primarily targeted at industries with skills shortages and gave priority to apprentices from regional and remote areas, Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander apprentices, apprentices with a disability, apprentices in non-traditional occupations, school based apprentices and apprentices who were considered vulnerable youth. It worked. It was needed. When it was abolished, industry groups like the MTA begged for it to be reinstated, but this fell on deaf ears. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We listen to industry. We acknowledge that for a modest investment the industry got some pretty substantial future returns. NXT is proud that we were able to work with government to secure $60 million over two years in the May budget for industry specialist mentoring for Australian apprentices. The aim of the program is to support 45,000 apprentices and trainees in their first two years of training, when they are most vulnerable to quitting. The funding is meant to kick in this financial year, and we will be keeping a keen eye on this to ensure the program starts this year and the full funding is delivered as promised. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I was struck by how much this modest funding meant to this industry, just one of the industries which will benefit from the program. Unfortunately, despite its contribution to jobs and the economy, this industry is not benefitting from a consistent response or dedicated support from government. It only saw a fraction of the $900 million promised in the Automotive Transformation Scheme, and it is still waiting for the government's response to the Senate Economics References Committee's 2015 report on the future of the Australian automotive industry.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The committee's report made some strong recommendations to underpin the industry during this time of massive change, including maintaining the Automotive Transformation Scheme funding through to 2020-21 and broadening its objective to support industry-wide diversification and transformation. It also recommended the establishment of an automotive industry taskforce to develop and implement a national automotive policy to help the industry meet the challenges and opportunities associated with alternative fuels and emerging technologies. Industry minister Arthur Sinodinos acknowledged that this is a key sector and that it is going through unprecedented change. The government has recognised this with a $100 million Advanced Manufacturing Fund to be delivered over five years. However, we still need an overarching strategy to help the industry navigate this time of upheaval. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I'm sure the minister is sincere in his goodwill towards the industry. However, it has been more than 18 months and, more importantly, two federal budgets since the committee handed down its report, and we have yet to see an effective response from government. When my colleague Nick Xenophon asked during question time last month about what, if any, progress had been made and when the government would respond to the report's recommendations, Senator Sinodinos had to take the question on notice. While the current funding commitments are necessary and welcome, we still don't have a guiding national policy or overarching strategies to support the industry's evolution during this time of transition. I urge the government to continue its support of the industry by urgently responding to the recommendations of the report on the future of Australia's automotive industry and considering what other concrete and coordinated actions it can take to support the industry's ongoing transition.</span>

                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Senator KETTER</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Queensland</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">20:49</span>):  I rise tonight to speak on behalf of Queenslanders who've been let down by the Turnbull government. Specifically I want to talk about how the Turnbull government has let down Queensland local councils. Whether it was the freezing of the Financial Assistance Grants for years, the inaction on the NDRRA funding or leaving regional Queensland to fend for itself when it comes to digital connectivity, the Turnbull government has left local Queensland councils and regional Queenslanders behind. The way in which communities in regional Queensland have been treated time and again by this rabble of a government can only be described as abhorrent. Queensland—the Sunshine State, the Smart State—has been left in the lurch again.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The estimated damage caused to many Central Queensland communities by Cyclone Debbie is astronomical. According to international reinsurer Munich Re, Tropical Cyclone Debbie was the second largest natural disaster in the world in the first half of 2017, with overall losses of US$2.7 billion and insured losses estimated to be US$1.4 billion. The burden felt by business and the broader community is reflected in the latest Sensis Business Index report, showing a sharp drop in confidence among small and medium businesses in regional Queensland in the wake of Tropical Cyclone Debbie.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We often hear from those opposite that they support small business. Indeed, one of the Treasurer's favourite taglines is, 'Small business is the engine room of our economy.' But what did this government do? They abandoned small business in North Queensland and Central Queensland. They abandoned Queenslanders. They abandoned the very people who ensured their electoral survival. They do not commit themselves to restoring prosperity in regional Queensland and, in doing so, they admit that they do not care about regional Queensland.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Just over a year ago, the Prime Minister sent us all onto the election hustings for one of the longest and most enduring election campaigns in Australia's recent history. He promised Queenslanders jobs and growth, but what he has delivered suggests otherwise. He delivered a tax cut for millionaires and a tax hike for working people. He delivered cuts to school funding. He delivered a slower and more expensive NBN. He delivered a cut to the wages of Australia's lowest paid workers. He delivered for himself and for himself alone. He certainly hasn't delivered for Queensland.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Here we have a situation where the federal government is short-changing people off the back of Cyclone Debbie. All Central Queensland LNP MPs should have intervened much earlier in the wake of this disaster. They should have reached a concrete agreement with the federal government to revitalise towns affected by the storm. On the day, they were happy to take photos and smile with the victims of the disaster, but when it comes to rebuilding our communities, they're noticeably absent.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The situation became so serious that the Local Government Association of Queensland took the extraordinary step of writing to the Prime Minister to request a meeting to discuss his government's gross mishandling of disaster relief funding for the Whitsunday, Mackay and Rockhampton regional councils. The mayors of the three affected councils, along with the LGAQ, all called on the Prime Minister to immediately revisit the affected areas to see just how important these projects are to the people in these communities. When it comes to funding councils—the governments who are on the ground—this government continues to play catch-up. I wrote a number of times in regional newspapers about how beneficial unfreezing the indexation of the Financial Assistance Grants for local councils would be for our regional communities. I'm pleased to say that, after a mammoth campaign from the Australian Local Government Association and Labor MPs like Stephen Jones, the government changed its tune and supported our position.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Hopefully we will eventually see a similar outcome for this disaster relief funding. The Queensland government has already said it will stump up $110 million for disaster relief through the NDRRA. That's a commitment. All Queenslanders are asking for is for Mr Turnbull to match the commitment—not match a quarter of that commitment, not match half of that $110 million commitment; match the whole commitment, dollar for dollar. I note that the Prime Minister recently announced an extra $18 million for reconstruction in Central Queensland, but I also note that the head of the Local Government Association of Queensland last week again called on the Prime Minister to match the Palaszczuk government's $110 million package. He indicated that the extra funding would only go part of the way to meeting Canberra's responsibilities under the Natural Disaster Relief and Recovery Arrangements. He made the point that this decision should be above politics, and that we're talking about getting regional economies back on their feet. It's interesting that he made that point, because it's similar to the point that the mayor of Mackay Regional Council made to me on this particular issue when I met with him on 17 July.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I note also that Greg Williamson, the mayor, went much further. Later, a few days after I met with him, he commented on the Turnbull government's initial response to the NDRRA funding, which was extremely disappointing. That response from the Prime Minister indicated that they are not going to match the funding because there has not been enough evidence provided to establish the need for the measure. Greg Williamson made the comment: </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Small">To say there is no damage is outright lies. The community has got to pay for the damage somehow. Nobody can believe the Feds would play this game at this stage.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">That's typical of what we are up against. Mr Hallam, from the LGAQ, called on Mr Turnbull to match the Queensland government's funding. This could be over in an instant. It could be a done deal. We could have more jobs, more investment and more infrastructure across Central Queensland, but we don't. It looks like the federal government is expecting Queenslanders to foot the remainder of the bill. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The same thing happened last year when Mr Turnbull was dragged kicking and screaming to help pay for recovery efforts in the wake of cyclones Oswald, Marcia and Ita. Queenslanders shouldn't have to go through this every time there is a natural disaster. In January this year 34 regional councils were exposed to a plant and equipment hire risk from disasters in 2013-14. This government refused to reimburse councils for work undertaken to the tune of $3.63 million. Most of the councils at risk of exposure were some of our smallest and underresourced councils—like Barcoo, Winton, Barcaldine, Longreach, Blackall-Tambo and Boulia. Again, the Queensland Labor government quickly and effectively committed to ensuring councils received the appropriate funding under the NDRRA. The federal government at that time remained missing in action. The angst in these communities has only been exacerbated by the complete lack of response from the Prime Minister, the minister responsible, Minister Keenan, and their offices. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">This is telling of a government that's more concerned with factional infighting than the livelihoods of the people they purport to represent. The government's response to disaster relief applications from the Queensland government is absolutely shameful. It shows a complete lack of understanding by the government of the significance of the effect Cyclone Debbie had on these communities. The three councils have spent a lot of time and resources compiling scoping documents, master plans and engineering reports to support these priority projects, yet Justice Minister Keenan said the application was not worth the paper it was written on. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">More than four months after the event, these communities should not be the subject of this level of uncertainty. This government's total lack of empathy along with its inability to resolve the category D application issue speaks volumes about its inability to govern. These communities are not being treated fairly. Many have been funded for category D in the past. In 2013 the federal government approved a Newman government application for Bundaberg in two days, with a letter and a three-page table, and that was an agreement to cost-share $121.6 million of a $248 million package. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">If you go back to 2011, there was $20 million approved by the federal government to fund the Toowoomba flood mitigation project; $18 million for relocation of Grantham; $15 million for the Cassowary Coast support package, including $9.5 million for Cardwell foreshore; and $145 million approved for Brisbane ferry terminals and riverwalk replacement. That occurred in 2011. The difference back in 2011 was that we had a federal Labor government, a government that delivered for Queenslanders and a government that Queenslanders could rely on.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The Turnbull government has left regional Queensland behind. Whether it was freezing of regional assistance grants, failure to help with disaster funding or failure to provide decent communication services, regional Queenslanders and their local councils have been let down. It is about time we had a federal government that had the back of these local councils. </span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">
                  <a href="195565" type="MemberSpeech">
                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Senator WHISH-WILSON</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Tasmania</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">20:59</span>):  I rise this evening to tell the story of Mr Ron Shamir, an experienced intelligence analyst who blew the whistle on shady dealings at the Australian Taxation Office and lost his job for his troubles. I am willing to table any documents to substantiate the facts I'm about to put on the parliamentary record. Mr Shamir worked in the ATO's serious tax evasion branch, which deals with some of the most egregious cases of tax evasion and fraud. In 2011 an unfavourable High Court decision for Commissioner of Taxation v Multiflex significantly changed the way compliance areas of the ATO, like Mr Shamir's, could operate. The decision meant that the ATO had less time to check the validity around $9 billion in suspicious GST refund claims. Having less time to check claims meant less opportunity to identify and stop fraudulent claims, which threatened the ATO's revenue-collecting targets.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">In 2012, Mr Shamir noticed that the ATO was taking intentional short cuts to reach revenue targets. These short cuts involved suspending taxpayer rights while applying extraordinary ATO powers without the required evidence. He was concerned about the potential impact on compliant taxpayers. To Mr Shamir it looked like the ATO was recounting funds paid out to fraud syndicates as revenue collected towards the ATO's collection targets. Even worse, the ATO's actions appeared to shield suspected fraudulent entities from future scrutiny or audit action. What he found was that the ATO was opting to lose future revenue, actual money, in order to give the appearance that the ATO was bringing in revenue and meeting its targets. In fact, no money would ever arrive.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Mr Shamir reported the suspected misconduct to the ATO integrity assurance branch. He received no response. He then attempted to locate the ATO's independent Integrity Advisor. It appeared the position no longer existed. Instead, the ATO's integrity assurance branch referred Mr Shamir's complaint to the business division he had complained about. It is no surprise that the division denied there was an issue. In fact, it said that the senior executive level had signed off on the practice. As a result, the integrity assurance branch closed the case. This is the very same integrity assurance branch that allegedly failed to investigate a 2015 complaint about recently dismissed Deputy Commissioner Michael Cranston.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The last attempt Mr Shamir made to address his concerns was to approach one of the assistant commissioners who endorsed the operations. The following day the assistant commissioner advised Mr Shamir that the operations he was concerned about had been withdrawn and replaced with new procedures. Despite concerns about the difficulty in getting this reply, Mr Shamir hoped that this was the end of the matter. Unfortunately, it was not. He began to experience reprisals. His team and role were abolished, and the ATO refused to move him to one of its many intelligence roles. Instead, he was moved to a senior auditing role, a specialised area in which he had no background or experience. Management also alleged he had breached the code of conduct and threatened to record a complaint on his government security clearance files.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">In 2014, Mr Shamir contacted the external oversight agency for the ATO, the Inspector-General of Taxation, about his fraud concerns. By this stage, he had continued to notice other concerning practices at the ATO. After ensuring that the inspector-general could protect him from reprisals, Mr Shamir agreed to proceed with his complaint and was legally compelled to provide evidence under an official section 9 notice. Collecting this evidence was his last act as an ATO employee. A few days after advising the ATO that he had been issued with a notice, Mr Shamir was tapped on the shoulder at work by a security guard. He was issued with a termination notice and escorted off the ATO premises. Mr Shamir contacted the inspector-general for protection but received no help.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The ATO said to the court in response to Mr Shamir's suspension that Mr Shamir:</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Small">… cannot be compelled to give what he does not have. He doesn't have access to ATO systems and the ATO does not propose to give it to him to enable him to act as a vigilante inspector.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">In that statement, the ATO makes it clear that the motivating factor in his suspension was to prevent Mr Shamir accessing ATO systems. A week later, Mr Shamir was fired on the basis of nonperformance of his audit duties. The Fair Work Commissioner ruled in March 2016 that Mr Shamir's termination by the ATO was harsh, unfair, unreasonable and indefensible and ordered that Mr Shamir be reinstated. Within hours of that decision, the ATO advised the tribunal through a top tier legal firm that an eminent QC would be lodging an appeal of the decision on behalf of the ATO to the full bench. During the appeal, the ATO offered Mr Shamir $360,000 in return for settlement and confidentiality. Under the terms of the agreement, Mr Shamir would not only have to remain silent but also, extraordinarily, actively have to dissuade media outlets from publishing information should they be inquiring about his case. He was advised that, if he did not accept the offer, the ATO would continue to use its extensive legal resources to oppose any future court decisions favourable to Mr Shamir.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Courageously and as a matter of principle, Mr Shamir did not accept the ATO's offer, despite personal legal debts at that time of more than $200,000. He didn't have the resources to adequately oppose the ATO appeal, and the full bench of the Fair Work Commission reversed the initial decision, saying that the ATO had a right to terminate his employment. He could not afford to appeal. He has not been able to find employment since, despite hundreds of applications and dozens of interviews—some in much more junior positions. His legal debts and loss of income now amount to more than $500,000. He is living with the constant threat of bankruptcy, losing his family's home and not knowing how to provide for his young children.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Mr Shamir's experience sends a deeply concerning message about the way Australian government agencies treat whistleblowers. We should be ashamed that someone who has, with the best intentions, exposed fraud or misconduct has been treated so poorly. Ron Shamir was a dedicated public servant who, acting in the public interest, sought to rectify a serious breach within the ATO. After much internal obfuscation, the ATO has acknowledged that there was a breach, yet Ron was not protected at any step along the way. His decision to blow the whistle resulted in him losing his livelihood and having legal debts that he now cannot repay.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Ron has been ground down by the machine. Others who come across fraud or misconduct will look at Ron's experience and think twice before coming forward with information that is in the public interest. This is to the detriment of all of us. It is in contradiction to an efficient and fearless Public Service, and it undermines the peoples' trust in our democratic institutions. What Ron has gone through is a clear demonstration that we need to do more to protect whistleblowers. We need to go further than legal protections. We need to recognise the toll that whistleblowing has on a person's life, their financial stability, their job security and their mental health. It is time for us to follow the lead of the US and the calls by the ASIC Chairman, Greg Medcraft, and offer financial rewards for whistleblowers who come forward. Sadly, that's because they very often find themselves in Mr Shamir's circumstance, where they can no longer get employment.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I will be taking Ron's treatment up with the ATO directly, and I will ask that they cover Ron's legal expenses. I've also written this afternoon to the Minister for Finance, Senator Cormann, to urge him to provide a reference for Mr Shamir so that he is given a fighting chance of being able to regain employment. Someone of Ron's character and integrity is an asset to the Public Service, to this nation and to the wider world, and I hope he secures gainful employment over the coming weeks and months.</span>

                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Senator PRATT</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Western Australia</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">21:08</span>):  I rise tonight because it's a very important week on the national calendar, and that is National Child Protection Week. It's an opportunity for us to have a national discussion in our Australian community to think about the work that we need to do together to keep children safe in our nation. It's an opportunity for us to talk about what we can do here in this parliament to strengthen communities and support families to make sure that every child in Australia is safe and secure.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">This week, the National Association for Prevention of Child Abuse and Neglect is asking us to spread three important messages, and one is that we all have a part to play in protecting all children. Even small actions can help improve a child's future. By building stronger communities, we're creating safer environments for our nation's children. Right now, more than ever, we need to take action. The rate of child protection notifications in this nation has grown from 33.8 children per 1,000 children in 2011-12 to 42 children per 1,000 children in 2015-16. There are a range of factors behind this. One is increased notifications and mandatory reporting, which means the notifications have gone up. But we don't have any real sense of what the underlying prevalence figures actually are. What we do know, and what these figures clearly show us, is that there are too many children in our nation who have dire needs and who are facing dire consequences. We need to do more to make sure not only that we stop this number from increasing but that we work together to give these children the protection and security that they need. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">This is about a national conversation and a national focus on children's wellbeing and the value of children in society. We will not drive these figures down in our nation unless we—as individuals, as government, as communities and as institutions—put more priority on children and lift the focus on children above other demands. We need to give families in our nation the very best chance at raising children. I am particularly proud of Labor's role in developing the National Framework for Protecting Australia's Children, and I commend Jenny Macklin for the work she did on that back in about 2009. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Last week, with Jenny Macklin, the shadow minister for families and social services, we held a meeting with family and children's support services, peak bodies and research providers as part of Labor's community sector partnership. We had a terrific discussion about what we can all do, and what Labor can do in government, to better advance and promote the wellbeing of Australia's children. The message from the room was clear: we need a bigger focus on early intervention and prevention in our nation. It is important that our focus shifts to ensure that we prevent children from ever coming into contact with the child protection system. This is about reducing the prevalence of child abuse and neglect, which means government needs to evolve from a risk-and-response approach to a focus on the wellbeing of children. This is not an easy thing to do in our complex, federated structure where we have state systems responsible for the statutory protection systems and we have Commonwealth funding support systems that aren't necessarily well connected to those statutory systems. We need proper wellbeing interventions before children enter that statutory child protection system, because we have far too many services that are siloed and disconnected. It is important that we have a real conversation about how to fix these issues. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">In addition, too many families in Australia are struggling with financial stress, with unemployment and underemployment, and with the increasing costs of health care from the government's attacks on Medicare. These pressures inevitably have a big impact on Australia's children. They increase rates of household conflict, and poverty was acknowledged by the community sector partnership as being a key driver for child abuse and neglect. So addressing inequality is key to protecting Australian families and Australian children. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Labor's focus on tackling inequality is certainly about helping ordinary Australian families. It is, in particular, about helping disadvantaged families, who are suffering a great deal under this government. The government's focus is not on making their lives better, as it should be. You can't separate issues of child protection from things like having a fairer tax system in our nation, because one of the key drivers for ensuring children's wellbeing is protecting the household income. It is why Labor takes very seriously the need for stable household incomes and commitment to things like family tax benefit A and B in our nation. In order to pay for those things, it also means that we need to make sure that the big end of town pays their fair share of tax. It's about maintaining a focus on universal health care, good-quality education, needs based education funding and quality affordable child care that's not just about employment outcomes but about the early childhood outcomes for children as well. These are all key parts of the government's role in ensuring that our nation's children have the best start in life. These are not remote from the issues of child protection because unless you have quality universal programs that families identify with and relate to then children get left behind.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Labor are committed to that safety net for Australia's children, but we are also committed to preventing child abuse. It is why we established the Royal Commission into Institutional Responses to Child Sexual Abuse back in 2013. I have to say, though, that the Liberal government has been way too slow at responding to the recommendations that have come out of the royal commission today on things like the national redress scheme and, importantly, on recommendations that would prevent abuse into the future. Back in 2015, the royal commission recommended that within 12 months we should have a national working-with-children check in place. Now it is 2017 and there has been no substantive progress towards that outcome. The report released by the royal commission back in 2015 made specific recommendations to the Commonwealth to be implemented within 12 months. This included compiling a database that checked historical criminal records and sought to make sure that international records would also be accessible. But I am yet to see any evidence that these have been acted upon or implemented.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We have the final royal commission report due to be handed down in November, and this government better be prepared to act quickly on the recommendations of that report. But it does not seem ready at all. Redress is a very important part of this work, but there are so many important measures. There are hundreds of really important recommendations that have come out of the royal commission that are about preventing this kind of abuse into the future and creating child-safe organisations so that we value children and do not let harm occur to them. As a nation, we must redouble our efforts to make sure that every child has the right to a safe and happy childhood. We can and must do more. As Leesa Waters, who is Deputy CEO of the National Association for Prevention of Child Abuse and Neglect, says:</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Small">Don't wait until a child has been abused or neglected before you do something. We need to work together as a community to STOP this from happening in the first place.</span>

                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Senator RHIANNON</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">New South Wales</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">21:17</span>):  Australia markets itself to the world as a clean, green country. We say we have an abundance of wilderness teeming with wildlife and global environmental credentials in flora, fauna and landscape systems. However, wildlife diplomacy shatters this perception. But let's start with Australia's shameful record as the nation with the highest rate of mammal extinctions since European colonisation reported anywhere in the world. Currently, 55 Australian animals are listed as becoming extinct in the wild since 1788, 30 of them terrestrial mammals. These numbers are on the rise. In May 2016, another 49 flora and fauna species were federally listed as threatened with extinction, including six more mammal species. Another 80 ecological communities, habitats for the species dependent on them, are listed as endangered, with as little as one per cent left for some of the communities. Another 506 animals are listed as threatened at a federal level, and 109 of those species are mammals.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Extinctions happen incrementally. There are untold local extinctions happening across Australia with no-one noticing. And yet, within this context of irreversible loss and destruction, governments continue to approve, fund and facilitate the destruction of our ecological communities. This means terrible suffering and obliteration of the wildlife within them. Land clearing removes habitat and that contributes to the extinction pressures on our unique species and causes considerable suffering on individual animals.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">This is no surprise, given the support governments provide to industries that explicitly and unashamedly profit from the pain and suffering of animals. Tragically, the suffering of wildlife seems to be widely ignored and is clearly a throwaway consideration for Australian governments and departments at all levels. It is a great irony that governments and ministers continue to use our wildlife as live gifts or objects of curiosity to promote diplomatic goodwill or to cultivate political relationships and the trade deals that follow. This is done without a second thought to the distress and suffering inflicted on the individual animals used in this way. There is no excuse to plead ignorance or argue that animals are not sentient and are not capable of suffering.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">This mechanistic view belongs to centuries past. Common sense, thoughtful observation and empathy towards animals are increasingly supported by science, confirming the suffering borne by animals used by humans. The science is clear: confinement and lack of ability to physically live, move, behave and interact according to a species' being is cruel. Loud noise is a recognised stressor in all animals. Exposure to crowds and noise causes abnormal behaviour due to stress. When animals are moved, particularly to other countries, changes in food and disrupted feeding patterns, along with environmental changes, can result in serious illness. These serious problems are widely recognised by experienced wildlife rehabilitators. Removing individual animals from bonded fellow species causes suffering. High cortisol levels, signs of heightened stress and a need to flee persist for days or weeks in transported animals. These problems are well documented.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Despite that, Australian governments are allowing the use of Australian wildlife in exercises of diplomacy or under the guise of protecting species from extinction. A recent example is continuation of a history of platypus diplomacy, which began with a young live platypus gifted and shipped to Winston Churchill in 1943, despite the certainty of suffering and likely death of the animal. Experts advised this would most likely be the outcome, and it was. In 1958, three platypuses were sent to the Bronx Zoo and they died within a year. Our iconic platypus is an animal unlike any other in the world. This species, however, could be extinct due to the destruction and death of Australia's rivers and waterways.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Despite a long history and high likelihood of exported platypuses dying, Taronga Zoo is working with San Diego Zoo to export platypuses in exchange for the import of African Okapi to populate its displays of live animals. I was alerted to the San Diego Zoo plans by Dr Tom Grant and Professor Frank Carrick. In Senate estimates in February this year, the Threatened Species Commissioner divulged that San Diego Zoo would be investing $500,000 into a yet to be detailed platypus conservation project in Australia. Meanwhile, platypus habitat continues to be destroyed. This appears to be occurring with few, if any, checks by government. This suggests a worrying cash-for-export-and-display deal that ignores the known suffering of transported animals and the high risk of death. I want to share with you some correspondence from Tom Grant. On 21 June, he wrote:</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Small">It is of concern to me that the export of platypuses to overseas institutions for display and financial gain is being proposed, when surely the highest priority must be to preserve wild populations and to establish a number of genetically diverse breeding populations within Australia as source animals for possible release back into the wild, should they become necessary for the conservation of the species. These priorities are further highlighted by Mr Gary Fry, from Taronga Zoo, reporting at the national conference that the successful captive breeding of platypuses is still considered difficult to achieve.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Small">This purported export scheme very much smacks of a money grab by the proponents which, like overseas export of Koalas has done in the past, is destined to have nil or trivial benefit to the species or the nation (as opposed to zoos or mining companies!). It is particularly egregious that the suggested recipient is San Diego Zoo—which has made multi millions of dollars … from display merchandising and on-selling Koalas to zoos in various parts of the world; with a relatively trivial benefit to Koalas, let alone their rapidly diminishing habitat …</span>
              </p>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">Koalas have also been used by successive governments keen to promote wildlife diplomacy. What about the koalas—where are the benefits to their preservation? What is going on at DFAT with regard to wildlife diplomacy? There are many questions they need to answer. What environmental advice do they have to justify wildlife diplomacy? Is DFAT tracking how many of its wildlife diplomacy animals have died? What did they die of? Is DFAT considering putting the interest of animals before that of the government, or do trade and diplomatic interests trump wildlife conservation and animal welfare? Exactly how have the species or the individual animals benefited from being removed from their homes? How have they benefited from suffering the transport to the overseas destination? What about being displayed as charismatic curiosities to crowds in foreign zoos day in and day out? Out of eight koalas pledged by South Australia to the Hong Kong zoo in 2010 and 2011, just two are still resident at the zoo, with no information available as to the outcome for the six remaining pledged animals. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The localised extinctions of platypus and koalas continue apace, symbolic of the suffering and loss of so many other animals that most Australians barely know exist. Where have our government ministers, zoo directors, diplomats and ministers been while wildlife diplomacy has been wreaking havoc? The diplomatic trade in wildlife and the marketing exercises by governments to veneer over the suffering they are causing and the extinctions they are presiding over is a national disgrace. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Our foreign minister, Julie Bishop, describes koala diplomacy as a marketing exercise that portrays Australia in a soft light and promotes our values as an open, free, tolerant democracy. They are her words: 'our values as an open, free, tolerant democracy'. What rubbish, considering we face the increasing likelihood of more extinctions as habitat is bulldozed for development and mining. We must stop treating animals as commodities or curiosities. We have a responsibility to treat them with respect as sentient creatures. That means stopping wildlife diplomacy; ending photo op wildlife circuses when foreign diplomats come to this country; and conserving what little natural environment and biodiversity we have left. There is still time. </span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">
                  <a href="247512" type="MemberSpeech">
                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Senator KITCHING</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Victoria</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">21:27</span>):  I rise this evening to tell the Senate about the shameful treatment of a group of overworked, underappreciated and underpaid workers in my state of Victoria and their struggle to get their employer to pay them a decent wage. As is too often true in cases such as this, these underpaid workers are mostly women. I am referring to the 600 pathology workers who have a long-running industrial dispute with their employer, Dorevitch Pathology, a subsidiary of the Primary Health Care company. These workers are among the lowest-paid pathology workers in Australia. Despite the fact that Primary Health Care has made an estimated $1.2 billion in profits over the past decade, these workers have not received a pay increase in all of that time. This means, of course, that after allowing for inflation, their wages have gone backwards in real terms. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">It is important to understand that these are skilled workers who perform work which is vitally important to public health in Victoria. Dorevitch provides pathology services under contract to 32 Victorian public health services, 29 of which are in regional areas. Over 70 per cent of all medical diagnoses in Victoria are based on the skill and expertise of Dorevitch's workers. They are expected to meet very high professional standards, and I will come to an instance about why this is so important shortly. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We, as a community, and as a public, expect our pathology workers to have those skills, because if they get it wrong there can be dire consequences. It is a disgrace that, despite their high skill level and the importance of their work, their pay has deteriorated so far that they could now be earning more money stacking shelves in a supermarket. Why do I use that particular comparison? I use it because these workers know that their teenage kids, living at home, earn more money per hour in their part-time after school jobs stacking supermarket shelves than they do. No wonder they feel outraged. This has been going on for years. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The importance of highly-skilled pathology work has been underlined by the flu epidemic we have experienced over this past winter in Victoria—the worst outbreak of flu in 15 years. Approximately 10,000 Victorians have been diagnosed with this flu. In August, we saw the sad case of a nursing home in Wangaratta where eight elderly residents died of this particularly virulent strain of the flu. This underlines the fact that any disruption of pathology services will hit regional areas particularly hard since there is often no alternative service. Pathology workers are in the front line of both preventing and detecting such outbreaks of infectious disease. This is all the more reason why they should be paid at a level appropriate to their skill and expertise. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The existing enterprise agreement between Dorevitch and the Health Workers Union expired in 2007—that's right, 10 years ago. Since then, the company has used every trick it can think of to delay negotiating a new agreement, ignoring the requirement of the Fair Work Act that it negotiate in good faith with its employees through their union. As a result of the long delay, Dorevitch's workers are now receiving on average $7,000 a year less than the industry standard. These workers would require a 28 per cent pay increase just to reach that standard and restore the real wages they were earning a decade ago. Yet Dorevitch is refusing to offer them any increase at all. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">One might ask why these workers have decided not to go elsewhere for work if the pay comparison is so poor. A lot of them live in regional Victoria. Today, of course, we heard the Minister for Regional Development trying to distract us from her current woes by talking about regional Australia. This does seem to be an area that she has overlooked. Last month, Dorevitch's outrageous behaviour and, indeed, their unlawful behaviour, finally provoked the Dorevitch workers to strike. The action taken by the Dorevitch workers was protected industrial action under the Fair Work Act, which recognises the right of workers to withdraw their labour when employers refuse to negotiate in good faith. The strike was preceded by a ballot in which 90 per cent of the workers voted to take industrial action. While it is sometimes a little disturbing to listen to the Minister for Employment speak on industrial matters, because it is unclear whether she is deliberately obtuse or simply ignorant, make no mistake and have no outrage that this was a legal strike. It was also a limited strike from 7 to 15 August. It was limited because these workers are responsible people and know what it means to their community to have pathology services available. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">What was Dorevitch's response to this industrial action? Was it to act reasonably and start, belatedly, after 10 years, to act in good faith? Was it to return to the negotiating table with a bona fide wage offer? No. As might be expected from a company with Dorevitch's contemptuous attitude towards its employees, it wasn't. Their response was to lock out 89 of its workers, who were singled out because they are active unionists. These are the same employees who were involved in calling the strike and attending the rally outside Dorevitch's headquarters in Heidelberg on 7 August. This is unlawful under the Fair Work Act. This is the same employer who, after the rally, advertised on seek.com for people to replace this longstanding workforce. Why did they do this unlawful act? They did it because their CEO—these are the CEO's own words—believed that these employees could be replaced by 'trained monkeys' or that they could be replaced by Indians on $10 an hour. This is the same employer who had managers taking notes on who was participating in a rally—taking names and taking photos of them. That is absolutely disgraceful and intimidatory behaviour.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">If you were to meet these pathology collectors, these phlebotomists, you would not think of them as hardened industrial activists. These are middle-aged women or single mums working part time who know and love their patients and who love what they do. All of them thought long and hard about taking industrial action, because they had never done so before. These are the people whose lives this desperate, hanging-by-a-thread government would have you believe it is seeking to protect by its changes to workplace legislation. But these workers had had enough. Should an employer be able to take advantage of their workforce constantly for over 10 years? Should they be able to exploit that workforce? The CEO of Dorevitch, in the midst of this, decided to leave the company. The company wouldn't explain why he'd left but said simply that he had left after the rally and after the strike. The former CEO's name is Neville Moller—or, as his long-suffering employees refer to him, 'N Evil'.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">On 22 August, the Victorian industrial relations minister intervened in the dispute, as she's entitled to do under the Fair Work Act, by making an urgent application to the Fair Work Commission for both parties to terminate industrial action and be given 42 days to reach agreement under Fair Work supervision. That was because the company had, for 10 years, obviated and avoided its responsibilities to negotiate. Remember that, in all the time this dispute had been running, the past 10 years, Dorevitch's owner, Primary Health Care, posted a $1.2 billion profit, and it posted a $92 million profit for the past financial year. What has it offered its employees? It has offered them a zero per cent wage increase and a lockout. Its profits come from suppressing wages. Dorevitch has the Commonwealth contract for national bowel cancer screening kits, one of its most lucrative contracts. This contract is currently up for review. The government ought to know how the company treats its workforce. I hope that Dorevitch backs down from its intransigent position and makes a fair offer to its employees. If that doesn't happen, I hope that Fair Work does what it's designed to do and delivers a fair outcome to these workers.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I want to conclude by expressing my support for the Dorevitch workers, who have shown great discipline, courage and determination in pursuing a very just claim for fair treatment by a particularly greedy and unscrupulous employer. We on this side of the Senate will always be found to be on the side of workers when they use lawful means to pursue just claims for better pay and conditions.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">
                  <a href="121628" type="MemberSpeech">
                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Senator McALLISTER</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">New South Wales</span>—<span class="HPS-MinisterialTitles">Deputy Opposition Whip in the Senate</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">21:38</span>):  In Australia we face a huge challenge to protect our unique wildlife. An unacceptable number of our animals, such as the hairy-nosed wombat and the koala, are vulnerable, endangered or face extinction. Natural habitats are being cleared; river systems face pollution. The problem is complex and the solution requires a coordinated, strategic approach between federal, state and local governments. To add an extra layer of complexity, many habitats occur on private land, so we need to work with local communities. Indeed, we are frequently spurred into action by motivated, passionate community groups who love the landscapes that they share with Australian plants and animals. We have a long and difficult road ahead of us if we are to prevent further extinctions.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Tonight I want to share with you some of the work of an impressive not-for-profit group in Victoria, the Australian Platypus Conservancy. Their research and their advocacy show us that sometimes, in the middle of all this complexity, there's a simple answer. In this case it is the need to stop using a yabby trap that unnecessarily, unintentionally and sometimes illegally kills platypuses and other fauna, such as water rats and turtles. Despite a range of state and territory restrictions on traps in platypus habitats, the illegal use of traps by recreational anglers continues to kill this unique and extraordinary creature.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">In freshwater waterways around our country, on public and private land, recreational fishers are setting nets to catch yabbies. Many have bought inexpensive nets from camping stores, and they're unaware that the practice is illegal or that their attempts to catch yabbies pose a serious threat to platypuses. A published study into the causes of death of platypuses in Victoria found that 56 per cent of deaths with an identifiable cause were due to drowning in illegal traps or nets that were set by recreational fishers. About a third of these cases involved the use of enclosed traps—they're called opera house nets—despite the fact that they're banned in public waterways in that state.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Opera house nets are named for their similarity to the sails on the Sydney Opera House—two sails enclosed in nets. But the fact is that, once a platypus enters it, sometimes chasing the yabby, it's almost impossible for them to escape before they drown. The photos of these dead animals, sometimes more than one of them, laid out on the riverbanks alongside these traps are heartbreaking. The deadly risk that's posed by these particular nets has been quantified in research which found the opera-house-style nets prevented all animals tested from escaping within a time interval that would allow their survival. That's actually about two minutes for a platypus. Research into two other styles of nets found that they allowed more than 80 per cent of the animals in the test to escape and survive. The nets used in the trial were the modified opera house net and the closed-top pyramid.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I want to be really clear about this—I'm not suggesting that we stop yabbying. The point is that there are alternatives. These other styles of net are capable of successfully capturing yabbies without endangering platypuses and other air-breathing fauna such as water rats and turtles. The research has stated, 'Our findings suggest that opera house traps fitted with an opening in the roof should at least be equal to and potentially exceed the performance of a standard opera house trap when they're deployed by recreational or commercial fishers to harvest edible-sized yabbies.'</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We're not managing this well. Management of inland recreational fisheries is primarily a state and territory responsibility. Most jurisdictions have done something to try and address the issue, but the approaches are really inconsistent, and compliance is extremely low. In Tasmania and Western Australia, opera house nets are banned in all waters. In Victoria and the ACT, they're banned in public waters only, and no regulation exists for private and farm dams. In New South Wales and Queensland, bans exist in specific geographic zones, except that the description of these are complex, and they include instructions like, 'It applies east of the Newell Highway.' In South Australia and the Northern Territory, there are no restrictions in place at all.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The problem is that, in the retail environment, these nets are cheap, ubiquitous and just not compliant. They're widely available in fishing and camping shops all around the country. In New South Wales and in some other states, opera house nets need to have a bycatch-reduction device. It's a fixed ring that's fitted to the entrance. This would reduce the number of deaths, except for one very big problem—the nets are required by the department to be modified with a fixed ring before they are used, but they're not required to be modified with a fixed ring before they are sold, and they're not required to be sold with information about the required modifications. It's not hard to imagine why compliance from an unlicensed recreational yabby fisher, also known as someone around the corner from you who just wants to go out and do some yabby fishing, might be low.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Balancing the needs of a growing population and responsibly managing land for housing development and for agricultural uses is a difficult task. It's a huge task to protect habitat and wildlife. I'm not suggesting at all that we stop recreational fishing. What I am suggesting is that we can use other types of traps or modified traps that significantly reduce the risk to the platypus and still allow us to enjoy catching and eating yabbies. I like the idea of fishers getting out and using our rivers, creeks, lakes and dams. If there is an approach that means they can enjoy a day out fishing and help protect Australia's precious animals, surely it is something as a nation we could agree to make happen. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We need to do better in promoting safe alternatives to dangerous opera house nets. I have today written to the Minister for Environment and Energy, Mr Frydenberg, to ask what steps are being taken at the national level to mitigate these seemingly preventable deaths of our native fauna—in particular, our platypus. </span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">
                  <a href="00AOQ" type="MemberSpeech">
                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Senator MOORE</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Queensland</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">21:45</span>):  On 31 October 2000, the United Nations Security Council passed UN resolution 1325. That was the first time an international agreement acknowledged the pivotal role of women in building and maintaining peace as well as the disproportionate impact of conflict on women and girls. This resolution was the result of many years of strong advocacy, women and men from across the world expressing their own experiences and talking about the particular impact and need for women to be involved in all areas, looking at peace in our community and the impact of war. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Since that time, eight more resolutions from the United Nations Security Council have sought to strengthen the implementation of UNSCR 1325. They were passed in 2000, 2008, 2009, 2010, 2013 and, most recently, in 2015. These resolutions through the United Nations Security Council provide a framework for women, peace and security. Together these resolutions focus on four main areas: prevention, participation, protection, and relief and recovery. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The area of prevention is about supporting local women's peace initiatives and conflict resolution processes, strengthening women's rights under national law, and providing and improving intervention strategies in the presence of violence against women, including by persecuting and prosecuting those responsible for violations of international law. The area of participation is about increasing the participation of women at all levels of decision-making, in institutions and mechanisms related to conflict prevention, resolution and management, including peace processes and the participation of civilian, military and police women in UN field based operations. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The area of protection is about the protection of women and girls, and their rights—including in relation to sexual and gender based violence, an emergency humanitarian situation, such as in refugee camps and settlements, and the Security Council mission's resolution processes. The area of relief and recovery is about ensuring that a genuine gender perspective is incorporated into all relief and recovery efforts to support specific needs and recognise the capacities of women and girls, including in the design of disarmament, demobilisation and reintegration programs, refugee camps and settlements and, in Security Council mission resolution processes, the establishment of the rule of law and transitional justice. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">As part of this, there was moved a process to allow for national action plans to be developed in countries across the world. So far 66 countries, including Australia, have developed national action plans. The first one from Australia was a bit slow but we got there in 2012. We are now in the process of looking at the introduction of the second plan. Why is there a plan? There needs to be a plan so that there is a real purpose around looking at the pages and pages of rhetoric—one thing we do know is that the United Nations has lots of words, and Security Council resolution 1325 is not a short document. You can have all these words but, most importantly, you need to have action. That's why the action plans are the models on which countries can make their own commitment and ensure their own communities and institutions take part in making a real difference. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The purpose of the Australian national plan is to articulate Australia's ongoing commitment to implement UNSCR 1325 and the broader UN Security Council women, peace and security agenda. It's also to establish a clear framework for a coordinated whole-of-government approach to implementing this plan and related resolutions. We hear that 'whole-of-government process' way too often, but the importance is that this should not be isolated. We need to have engagement from across all levels of Australian government to ensure that they understand and are working together on this process. It's also to identify strategies and actions that Australia will undertake both domestically and overseas to implement 1325 and related resolutions and to measure the effectiveness of the work over the six-year period from 2012 to 2018. It's also to highlight the important work that Australia is doing in partnership with the international community to respond to women's needs, to recognise their roles, to promote equal participation and to protect women and girls' human rights in fragile conflict and post-conflict settings.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The implementation of the women, peace and security agenda must be a long-term and transformative piece of work. The need is to make actual change. We have the plan, and we need to ensure that there is transformation. It's about changing the approach to peace and security efforts in order to integrate a genuine gender perspective and consider the experience and the needs of women and girls across a range of complex issues. The national action plan is both a symbolic and a practical step which will bring Australia's implementation of UNSCR 1325 and the related resolutions into practice.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">It is not exhaustive, and it can never ever be static. It's a living document that will provide ongoing guidance to inform the work and policies of the Australian government agencies and departments. As this was the first plan, as part of plans across the other 65 nations across the world, it has to be a foundation document so that we introduce the plan and build on it during the 2012-18 period and also as we move forward to develop the new plan.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Part of the issue is that, within the period of this plan, there were at least two evaluations, because we know that there has to be effective monitoring and evaluation. The first one was in 2015 and then, on the basis of that, there is the final evaluation, which is taking place now. This national plan consists of five high-level strategies and 24 actions that fit underneath those strategies which are linked to the responsible implementing government agencies. The five key strategies are to integrate a gender perspective into Australia's policies on peace and security; to embed the women, peace and security agenda in the Australian government's approach to human resource management of Defence, the Australian Federal Police and deployed personnel; to support civil society organisations to promote equality and increase women's participation in conflict prevention, peace building, conflict resolution, and relief and recovery—they are, as you remember, the key areas that were a goal of the plan; to promote women, peace and security implementation internationally; and I suppose this is the one that pulls it together, to take a coordinated and holistic approach domestically and internationally to women, peace and security.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We got the plan in place. We had people who made a commitment, and, most importantly, we had one of those very important interdepartmental committees that was tasked with making sure the plan worked. So it happens, there was one more thing. The expectation was that there would be a report back to the parliament about what was happening with the plans. I have been watching, and I have been listening, and I don't think that there has been a wide celebration in parliament about what's happening with women, peace and security. That was one of the issues that was mentioned when we had the first round review in 2014-15. It had a clear look at what we were doing up until that stage. What it came up with was a recommendation that we could do better and that there were places that needed more focus. But, as I said, it was a foundational document; it actually got those words into the agenda; it got government agencies realising they had responsibilities in this space.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The interim report called for opportunities for collaboration between government and civil society—absolutely essential in this space, because we would not have had a women's peace and security plan if there had not been the active advocacy and engagement of civil society over very many years. It also said that we had to effectively implement the actions and gaps in challenges, we had to ensure the relevance of the plan was clearly known by all the participants and we had to really ensure that there was effective monitoring and evaluation. In that period, we have had the plan, we have had the first round review and now we are moving forward to 2018 to have a look at what happened with the six-year plan and also build on that to introduce the second plan, which is due to start at the end of 2018.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">One of the things that has been most important throughout this whole process is engaging with civil society. In fact, there is a group that has been formed amongst the NGOs which has a commitment to ensuring that this action is taken. That's the Australian Civil Society Coalition on Women, Peace and Security—hopefully called 'the coalition', which is much, much shorter. It is a non-partisan, independent coalition of civil society organisations, networks and individuals working to advance the women, peace and security agenda in Australia, our region of the Asia-Pacific and globally. This particular coalition is calling for people to become involved in their process. They're asking for people to want to join in this process. It brings together activists, feminists, practitioners, humanitarian actors and those with firsthand experience working on the frontline on issues relating to women, peace and security. Coalition members have a wide-ranging expertise in gender and peace. The coalition engages with the Australian government to progress the implementation and scope of the Australian national action plan, and it contributes to the dialogue on this agenda in Australia and our region by amplifying the perspectives of women's organisations working in conflict afflicted countries and working collectively to advocate for changes in policy and practice. That is the link. It is the link of people who have the lived experience and the commitment to bring their experiences into the policy development. We build alliances with others working on issues related to the women, peace and security agenda in order to constructively promote a gendered approach to peace and security, which was exactly the need and stimulant for the original process in 2000 and, subsequently, today. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The vision of the organisation—the coalition—is a world in which gender equality and the contributions and rights of diverse women and girls are at the forefront of transforming conflict to build peace. This is the core of women, peace and security. The purpose of this coalition is: to reshape the peace and security dialogue, policy and practice in Australia away from focusing increasingly on the militarised and security approach towards a transformative—there's that word again—women, peace and security agenda; to redefine security for all women within Australia's foreign and domestic policy; and to harness and bring together a solidarity of approach through the collective power of women's and peace movements towards our vision in Australia, our region and globally.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">This is what this group is doing in our community. They are working with government to ensure that we can take the transformative action that is the purpose of this plan. A document has been circulated to stimulate the discussion. One of the ways this is working is through a series of roundtables that are being coordinated around the country. I know there are some coming up in Brisbane and Melbourne through people who are part of the coalition, and I want to note particularly here the work of the women in international peace and security who have been working in this area for so long. There is a wonderful quote from an excerpt from <span style="font-style:italic;">Women Building Peace: What They Do, Why It Matters</span><span style="font-style:italic;"></span>by Sanam Naraghi Anderlini. This quote, for me, encapsulates what the core of 1325 is all about:</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Small">From Bogota to Baghdad, women are on the front lines of providing services, heading households, caring for the sick and the elderly, and sustaining and ensuring the survival of their families … It is often women who first give voice to civilians silenced by atrocities. Increasingly, they are claiming their place as major stakeholders and active agents in resisting war, building peace, and defining security on their terms…. There is no single ideology, approach, or even motivation that defines this growing sector, which veteran activist Cora Weiss calls "peace women." In effect, these women—be they antimilitarists, former fighters, the elite, or grassroots actors—come together through their commitment to social justice, fairness, and equality for all.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">That is the core of resolution 1325.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Every year there's a discussion at the UN where people bring together their experiences around this issue. In 2017 the global peace index presented us with a mixed bag of good and bad news. While, on the one hand, as a global community we're slightly more peaceful than we were in 2016, over the last decade we've actually become less peaceful. We are seeing a rising trend in peace inequality, with most countries having only small increases in peacefulness while a handful of countries have had large deteriorations in peace. Globally we have become susceptible to populist political movements.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">In 2017, under the peace index, overall 93 countries improved, while in 68 countries peace deteriorated, which is a cause for great alarm and concern. It means that these areas of the world are less peaceful. In that ranking—and I know we all like to see these performance tables—Iceland remains the most peaceful country in the world, and that's a position it's held since 2008. They have a plan. I'm not sure why things are particularly peaceful in Iceland, but perhaps we could learn a lot about why Iceland has such a peaceful environment and a commitment to peace. It's joined at the top of the index by New Zealand, Portugal, Austria and Denmark—and I am not going to make any comment about New Zealand. On the list, Australia ranks 12th out of 163 countries, so it's near the top of the index. However, we all know the areas that are the least peaceful, that are the most dangerous and where women and children are most vulnerable, and there does not seem to be much movement in that area at all. Syria remains the least peaceful country in the world, followed by Afghanistan, Iraq, South Sudan and Yemen.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We know that there is a commitment to maintaining the women, peace and security process. We need to ensure that the actions in this program are seen as effective, real and valuable, that it's not rhetoric, not something where you just tick a box or make a report; you actually can make a distinct difference. In this place we have seen reports about where this peace agenda has been integrated into Australia's work. Only in the last sitting period Senator Fierravanti-Wells and I talked about the process in the Solomon Islands and the RAMSI process and how, throughout that whole activity, which was noted as being a major success—governments from our region working together in a country where there had been war, where there had been complete disruption—an intervention was called upon by that government and responded to by people throughout our region. Throughout that whole process the issue of the women, peace and security structure was integrated into the action, and we saw women involved in the peacekeeping forces. We saw them working in community. We saw them rebuilding community. That is the kind of program that we have to ensure continues to exist. If you check the UN website you can see inspiring, challenging and heartbreaking stories about women from across the world in the most dangerous situations who have used their own experience, their energy and their commitment to change the societies in which they're living. They put the action into the plans I've been talking about this evening.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">In the middle of World War I, a group of women got together in Europe to talk about why there needed to be peace, why there had to be change, in the midst of what was at that stage a war that was tearing apart their whole environment. At that conference, women gathered and made a number of recommendations about how we could actually secure real peace in our lives. Many of those suggestions integrate immediately into the current Women, Peace and Security Programme. So, in October 2000, the women who were still with us from World War I could see that their words finally had acceptance by the United Nations. In 2018 we'll be building a new plan for Australia. We have to listen to the past, we have to understand this experience and we need to have genuine peace in our time.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Tasmania</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">22:05</span>):  Defence procurement is a huge issue. Defence is the Commonwealth's biggest procurer. The value to the economy is enormous. Because so much of taxpayers' money is being spent, it makes a big difference how and where the government decides to spend it. When it comes to defence procurement, the government says its policy is to 'maximise local manufacturing where it represents value for money'. As a result, it has passed up on local manufacturers because they couldn't compete with the companies paying their workers pennies on the dollar. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The men and women who work in our textile manufacturing industry are not well-paid millionaires, sitting on their hands doing nothing but having long lunches and drinking champagne. They're working hard and with pride in their product. It should be a matter of national pride for us too that, when we send Australian troops to war, we send them wearing boots made in the land they have sworn to defend. Australian companies shouldn't have to beg for contracts to produce uniforms and supplies for our Australian Defence Force personnel. The government should not be asking Australian companies to engage in a costly tendering process that requires them to demonstrate the broader economic benefit of their bid. It is self-evident that there will be flow-on benefits from Australian companies employing people to work on satisfying orders with Defence. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Take the example of South Australian boot manufacturer Rossi, which lost a Defence contract in 2014. The government said Rossi was not good value for money. They decided to hand the contract to an Indonesian company instead. This government isn't supporting Australian jobs by keeping Australian troops in Australian boots. Instead, it is giving its money to Indonesia. How many jobs are Australian taxpayers creating with their money being spent in Indonesia? I can tell you how many jobs they're creating in Australia: it's not a hell of a lot. Indonesia's gain is certainly our loss. Sometimes it's not Indonesia being favoured, to be fair; sometimes it's Vietnam; sometimes it's China. Sometimes it's any other country that is willing to undercut Australian workers with a second-rate product. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">It's more than just the money or the cost. When we send our defence budget offshore, we also send away our skills and our capacity. Local knowledge gets lost when we stop doing what we need to be doing locally. And, when we source defence uniforms locally, we make it easier to keep our Australian Defence Force members safe. Keeping that capacity local makes it easier to protect against counterfeiting and theft. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">It's better for jobs, too. When the Abbott government cancelled its orders of combat uniforms with the WorkWear Group in Footscray in 2015, it effectively gave the sack to 45 permanent workers. When you weaken a manufacturer by cancelling an order, you're weakening that manufacturer's capacity to be competitive on future orders, because, by not investing in Australian manufacturers, you're ripping away the income they can use to invest back into technology, innovation and of course the local community. Job losses in one part of the supply chain mean job losses throughout the whole supply chain. The flow-on effects of failing to invest in Australian made products are felt throughout the economy. And, if the government doesn't think Australian manufacturers represent good value for money, what sort of message does that send to the rest of the world about the quality and standards of our own manufactured goods?</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">It costs money for Australian businesses to engage in the tendering process. Businesses have to hire special consultants that charge tens of thousands of dollars for their services. It's a whole industry in itself. They do so knowing that the odds are completely stacked against them. They still have a shot, even though the likelihood of success is slim. The government seems like it has a plan to create jobs for specialised tendering consultants, but it has nothing to say for the many Australians who work or who should be working in Australia's textile manufacturing industry. Now we have reports that businesses are not or no longer putting their hands up for defence contracts because they think they have no chance of winning anyway, so what's the point? Who can blame them when the government prefers to fund factories in Indonesia over Australia?</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The simple fact of the matter is that, at the end of the day, I don't want the Australian government deciding it's better to save a buck than to save an industry, and that's exactly how they feel. We need Australian troops in Australian boots because it is the right thing to do. Australian defence uniforms should be 100 per cent manufactured ethically in Australia. We have workplace rights and conditions in this country that have been hard fought for and won by workers for centuries. We undermine those rights and conditions when we decide it's cheaper and easier to pay another country with no equivalent standards or concerns for workers' safety or their rights. We rip ourselves off when we pay others to do it worse for less. What's the real cost to the taxpayer by sending contracts offshore? What's the real cost to the workers, their families and their communities? Australian troops should be wearing Australian uniforms. It's as simple as that, and there are no excuses for not doing that.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I want to shift focus for a moment to discuss another matter because it is something that I think Australia needs to discuss. North Korea is a hermit regime and a nuclear power. It is a frightening combination. World leaders are often unstable characters, but, when they're unstable and nuclear, we need to think about how that affects all of us. I believe in the fundamental value of our democratic institutions to make decisions that affect us all. Our alliances are important to us because they keep us safe. The ANZUS alliance is important to us because it has kept us safe for years. Like any alliance, it underpins the way we operate in the national security space.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Our alliances also lend to the international community consistency and predictability. When our alliances stop keeping us safe and start putting us in harm's way, then it is appropriate for us to at least have a debate on them. It is the responsibility of the parliament to look after our troops. That's because, by the time they've come home, the government of the day when they left might be a thing of the past. We on all sides need to own the responsibility to properly care for our veterans. The only way to do that is for us to, on all sides of parliament, own the decision to make a soldier into a veteran in the first place.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We shouldn't be committed to a war on the basis of a handshake agreement between two leaders. Committing Australia to a conflict is the most serious decision a government can make, and it's important that that decision is not owned by any one side of politics. War should not be partisan; war should not be a debating point. War should be what we resort to when everything else fails and there is nothing left to do. It inflicts an enormous cost on our nation, no matter how worthy the cause for going in the first place. We should all know what the cost would be. It isn't a party political decision—it should be a decision we all take part in. We on all sides should have to put our hand on our heart and have our vote recorded for the history books. We should have the chance to record our position for or against, because, if the decision to go to war is the most serious one a government is capable of making, it makes sense to treat that decision-making process seriously as well. If governments believe that consultation, compromise and debate are important tools to the democratic decision-making process, then they believe in the value of a parliament. If the government believe in the parliament, then they should also believe that the parliament has a role to play.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Nobody wants a return to the dark days of Howard and Bush—the human suffering and the trail of destruction that their lies and their political ideology caused. Nobody wants to see Australia committed to a war based on a lie. That's what happened last time, and I'll be damned if I stand here and let it happen again. That's because there is no reason why we should go to war that can't first be properly aired in this chamber and discussed. The responsibility to look after our veterans is so enormous, so profound and so inalienable that we should be very careful and deliberate when making these very serious decisions. Nothing is lost by opening up the decision-making process to the parliament and nothing is lost by adding transparency and accountability to the process. All that is lost is the opportunity for a government to move unilaterally without consultation and without public scrutiny. Sometimes the exercise of that power is appropriate. There will be times when urgent intervention is critical. The government should therefore have the power to commit troops to conflict temporarily. But if the engagement is more than 30 days, that should require parliamentary approval. If parliament isn't sitting, then call a special sitting of parliament. That is reasonable and that makes sense.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I want the chance to be able to ask: the men and women we want to send to war have to come from somewhere; where exactly are they coming from now? The troops we have been deploying over and over and over again are exhausted. They have very little left. There's no reserve and we have no backup. We're sending more troops to fight for us without having the support services in place to take care of them when they get home from fighting for us. The reality is the cost of war isn't just guns and tanks and submarines in South Australia. The cost of war is borne every day by the men and women we send overseas and the families who support them when they come home—that is, if they come home. The cost is to the families who send off a husband or a wife, or a father or a mother, or a son or a daughter—the families who pray for their safe return and whose prayers are left unanswered. We have a solemn responsibility to look after those who go and those who are left behind. It is a responsibility that goes beyond party lines. It isn't a responsibility for Labor, for the Greens, for the Liberals or for the Nationals; it is a responsibility for all of us. It is a responsibility for the parliament and a responsibility for the nation that we are elected to represent. We should all make the decision and we should all live with the consequences of it. We shouldn't be afraid of debating the most important decision we can make as a nation, because once you make that decision, you can't unmake it.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">One of the greatest problems facing Australia is our ageing population. Aged care workers are on the frontline performing thankless work that once upon a time fell to extended family. It disappoints me when I hear stories of aged care workers fighting for decent compensation for the hours and the work that they put in. Recently, I was approached by employees at Wynyard's Synovum Care, who have been fighting through EBA negotiations for four long years. Synovum Care is a small aged care facility not far from my home on the northwest coast of Tasmania, with a dedicated group of staff who have been caring for the needs of the ageing members of the community for years. These workers do an excellent job caring for those who need it most, from the laundry to the cleaners, to the cooks and the maintenance workers who keep the place ticking along, to the carers and nurses working directly with the residents.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">These workers are in the trenches. The last thing they need to worry about is whether they are being paid properly. Yet here we are—the employees of Synovum have told me that they feel as if their managing director, Natasha Chadwick, has taken advantage of their love and care for their own community. The workers feel as if Ms Chadwick has not shown the care for her own staff that they show for the residents at Synovum every day. I am told that Ms Chadwick refuses to bargain with the employees at Wynyard, and they feel as if they are just another number on a spreadsheet instead of hardworking compassionate employees with the aim to make Synovum feel like home for the residents—unless, of course, you call suggestions to halve personal leave, slash redundancy entitlements and cuts to pay packets bargaining. I sure do not.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Like most Tasmanians I know, the Synovum employees are a determined group. They have rallied the support of their community, with many local businesses proudly displaying signs supporting Synovum workers. Their request doesn't seem unreasonable, and I question if it is even enough to compensate workers for going above and beyond their duty, as many of them have done. The Synovum employees have hearts of gold. They are in this industry because they care for people. I can tell you right now: they are sure not in the industry for the pay and conditions, certainly not when it comes to Synovum. All I ask is that the Synovum managing director, Ms Chadwick, takes time out of her busy schedule to actually visit Tasmania and see what it is her employees do every day to support residents and support Synovum Care. Her employees are more than just a number on a spreadsheet; these are workers who pour their energy into looking after other people's families and then go home and look after their own families. They have to be able to feed their children, send them to school and pay their medical bills, and all they are asking for is a fair go. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Finally, I want to speak briefly on reports that the Turnbull government is recycling ex-members of parliament with a series of jobs for mates. Eleven former Liberal MPs have been given taxpayer funded jobs this year by their mates in the Turnbull government. Nine of them lost their jobs in the last election. You have to wonder, with this government, why they think there is nobody more qualified for these highly paid jobs than the people who were turfed out by the voters at the last election. Were the rest of the candidates really that unqualified that the only person who could do the job happened to be an ex-Liberal member of parliament? Voters got rid of these people and the Prime Minister brought them back in. The government should be ashamed of themselves for thinking that taxpayers should continue to fund the people who they rejected at the last election. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">What sticks in most people's throats isn't that this is so shameless—we have seen these kinds of appointments over many years. The thing that bugs people the most about this is that it is just another example of there being one standard for politicians and another for the rest of us mere mortals. How useless are these political appointees that they couldn't find themselves a job without the help of the Prime Minister? How incompetent are they that they could only get a job because they were once a member of parliament and the Prime Minister felt sorry for them? Taxpayers should be looking at these appointments and thinking to themselves that if these ex-politicians couldn't find a paid gig in the private sector, in the real world, with all their experience as members of parliament, what sort of value for money were they getting in the first place? </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">How long do you think these ex-politicians spent on the dole queue before they got the tap on the shoulder? How long do you think they had to spend circling ads in the back of the newspaper? My bet is that their only experience of unemployment was the time it took them to pick up the phone on election night and ask for a mate's favour. Imagine being given a job not because you deserve it, not because you've earned it, not because you're the best person for it, but because the PM feels sorry for you. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I'd be ashamed to show my face back in parliament if I were them, but I'm sure I won't be in that position. When I'm done in this place it will be because voters have said they've had enough of me, or because I've said I've had enough of the sort of behaviour that's going on in this place. I can assure you, when it comes to ex-members of parliament, they need to get on with their lives, move out into the real world and get a gist of what is going on. Giving them a second chance here—and some of them are getting higher wages than they were getting in the first place—is absolutely shameless and a slap in the face for the normal Aussie out there. Quite frankly, normal Aussies don't want them in here. That is why they got turfed out in the first place. I don't want them in here. Get out in the real world and get a real job!</span>
