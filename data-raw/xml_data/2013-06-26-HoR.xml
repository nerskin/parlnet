This is a debate which the government has been mounting in the community for all of this term. The one thing that the opposition—neither the member for Flinders nor the member who has reserved her rights—have not told us this morning is why standing orders ought to be suspended today. I heard briefly from the member for Flinders about matters relating to Monday.</span>

                  </a>  On the point of order, Speaker, it was because he was speaking out of order. I gave him the appropriate warning. I told him he needed to speak in accordance with the standing orders. He needed to outline to the House as to why standing orders needed to be suspended now. The only thing I heard him talk about was next week. He needed to tell the House why standing orders needed to be suspended this morning and he did not. The member for Indi had that opportunity and she squibbed that opportunity. </span>

It is a requirement of the standing orders and practice and procedure that some such reason be given to the House and no such reason has been given to the House. </span>

It also means that, for so long as nuclear weapons exist, we are able to rely on the nuclear forces of the United States to deter nuclear attack on Australia. This was a point made by Prime Minister Hawke in 1984 when he stated that Australia could not claim the full protection of deterrence without being willing to make some contributions to its effectiveness.

New arrangements at Pine Gap were announced, which included the appointment of Australian Defence officials into senior management positions, including the then newly created position of deputy chief of facility.

                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Mr ROBERT</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Fadden</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">09:59</span>):  I thank the minister for his update to the House on the status of not only the Australian-US facilities but also wider Australian-US cooperation. Furthermore I take the opportunity to welcome the nomination of John Berry to fill the enormous shoes of Ambassador Jeffrey Bleich and Mrs Becky Bleich as US Ambassador to Australia. Whilst I understand there is a US Senate selection process, John Berry should know in advance that as a great friend of the US we welcome him and look forward to throwing a proverbial shrimp on the barbie when he arrives in Australia. I do not know if understanding the Australian vernacular is part of the US Senate selection criteria. If it is not perhaps it should be. Either way we look forward to welcoming the new US ambassador and look forward to thanking Ambassador Jeffrey Bleich and Mrs Becky Bleich at an appropriate juncture.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">In welcoming President Obama's next choice for ambassador, I also welcome the opportunity to provide coalition comment on the concept and principle of full knowledge and concurrence which governs the operation of Australian-US joint facilities. To echo the fine words of the last coalition defence minister, Brendan Nelson, he said:</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Small">Full Knowledge and Concurrence is an expression of Sovereignty, of a fundamental right to know what activities foreign Governments conduct on our soil. The people and parliament rightly hold the Government responsible for exercising this right. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">This principle has not changed though details of how it is enacted will always evolve over time. The key is that the principle is the underpinning of all new agreements or undertakings between Her Majesty's loyal government and the United States of America. The purpose of this morning of course in this great House is to reaffirm that principle.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I note the minister's comments in terms of Labor taking pride in Curtin's 1941 decision to look west to the US. I remind the minister that it was the Menzies government in 1951 that formalised the ANZUS Alliance at San Francisco on 1 September. It entered force on 29 April 1952. However, the point remains that the great decade from 1941 to 1951 can be seen as the bipartisan path to the great Australian-US friendship, a path that continues strongly to this day. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I have been proud to represent the coalition Defence team in this House during this term of parliament and to give voice to this bipartisanship on joint Australia-US relations. If the Australian people so decide on 14 September for a change of government, the US can be assured of a coalition that is a strong partner in peace and a loyal friend in conflict. We understand the alliance, as we always have, in terms of a great and enduring friendship between two proud nations and peoples as well as an alliance that provides mutual benefits and security, intelligence, communications and technology.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I agree with the minister that the alliance has rarely been stronger and I am pleased with the raft of ongoing relationships and consultations between our countries over the last two terms, starting with the 2008 AUSMIN with the military satellite communications partnership and the joint statement of principles on SATCOM bilateral cooperation, then the 2010 AUSMIN conference with the joint working group on force posture and the space situation awareness partnership, leading into the proposal for a full MAGTF marine-air-ground task force and USAF northern rotations which was announced at the 2011 Obama visit. The 2011 AUSMIN went on for the agreement on cyberattack triggering ANZUS mechanisms. The 2012 AUSMIN conference looked at a study into additional naval cooperation, particularly as it pertains to some of our western naval facilities, the MOU on the joint C-band radar space surveillance installation at the Harold E Holt naval comms facility in WA, the potential transfer of an advanced space surveillance telescope to Australia and the discussion on the establishment of a combined comms gateway in Western Australia for wider use of the wideband global satellite communication system that we have bought a substantial part of. Full knowledge and concurrence widely and appropriately cover the joint facilities or footprints on Australia's native soil.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The history of our joint facilities is well understood. It began ostensibly in 1955 with the joint geological and geophysical research station which is a seismic monitoring station originally established to monitor nuclear explosions during the Cold War. It still does monitor such explosions as part of the international monitoring system which is part of the comprehensive test ban treaty. It also monitors earthquakes. It is jointly operated by Geoscience Australia and the United States Air Force.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal"> </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">When we think of joint facilities though our mind mostly casts to 1967 with Pine Gap, which was renamed Joint Defence Facility Pine Gap in 1988. In 1967 we also saw the Naval Communication Station Harold E Holt, which was originally commissioned as a US base, becoming joint in 1974 and Australian in 1993. It is important to note the July 2008 treaty with the US does provide the US with access for a 25-year period. Of course in 1969 there was Nurrungar down in Woomera and that was decommissioned in 1999.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Today only the Joint Defence Facility Pine Gap and the Joint Geological and Geophysical Research Station are hosted in Australia, both near Alice Springs. However, as the minister has stated, the US has access to the following facilities: the Naval Communication Station Harold E Holt for submarine communications, the Mobile User Objective System located at the Australian Defence satellite comms station near Geraldton and the Extended High Accuracy Network Determination System, which is a research station in Learmonth.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">All of the US's involvement is with the full knowledge and concurrence of the Australian government of the day. Minister Smith has stated this has been the case with the Rudd-Gillard government and I can guarantee it will be the case should there be a future Abbott government. The coalition will take the US alliance seriously. We will make tangible contributions to the alliance. We are not fair-weather friends. Under any potential coalition government the alliance will remain the strategic cornerstone of our defence posture. Our contributions to joint facilities, as well as other military and strategic assistance, will give voice and action to this commitment.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I speak with some limited authority on joint facilities because I have been to them all. My fondest memory—though, I digress slightly—is Nurrungar that I went to in 1993 in a different guise. I was a very young lieutenant with the Airborne Battle Group and Prime Minister Keating had deployed the Airborne Battle Group to secure the internal facility, whilst the police secured the perimeter, during a Greens dominated demonstration. I have never been able to work out to this day why the Greens did a naked protest. They approached the base perimeter fence, removed all of their gear and tied cardboard spanners to the fence. I think it is emblematic of what the Greens do, but, frankly, it makes little sense. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Nothing has changed, unfortunately, since 1993 when I first came across the Greens and their idea of communication. In August 2009, when we visited Pine Gap, Senator Ludlam issued a press saying he was going to expose the role of Pine Gap in enabling United States nuclear war-fighting capabilities. Perhaps someone should tell this fringe party of the Greens that Pine Gap collects intelligence that assists with stopping the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction, verifies arms controls and provides a ballistic missile early warning function—all things I would have thought the Greens support. It is nothing like enabling United States nuclear war-fighting capabilities. If anything, it is the obverse, the opposite.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">However, considering my first introduction to the Greens party was when they got their gear off and tied cardboard spanners to fences, perhaps I should not expect too much from them. Whilst the Greens party remain on the fringe when it comes to defence matters and add very little to the alliance and the discussion, I am thankful that the two major parties have bipartisan consensus on the issue and have a responsible approach to keeping the nation informed. It is in that spirit that I thank the minister for his comments on full knowledge and concurrence and ensuring the parliament is up to date on the issue.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The bill amends the Insurance Contracts Act 1984 to introduce an unfair contract terms regime for general insurance contracts.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Since 1 July 2010, national unfair contract terms laws have applied to protect consumers that purchase goods or services using standard form contracts.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">However, these laws have until now been excluded from applying to insurance contracts.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The bill will close this gap and for the first time ensure consumers are protected from terms in their general insurance contracts which unfairly favour the insurer.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This is consistent with the Productivity Commission’s 2008 report into Australia’s consumer policy framework which recommended that the unfair contract terms protections apply to all sectors of the economy.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The bill will give consumers the confidence to know that in those traumatic times when they seek to make a claim under their insurance contract, no longer will those claims be refused because of an unfair term.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The regime introduced in this bill is modelled on that applying in the Australian Securities and Investments Commission Act 2001 to other financial products and services, with appropriate modification for contracts of general insurance.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The bill will extend protection from unfair terms to consumers who manage their personal risks by acquiring a standard form contract of general insurance, such as for damage or loss to their family home, its contents or their motor vehicle.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">When our nation’s communities suffer the devastation of flood, fire, cyclones or other natural disasters, residents can be confident of fair treatment in their insurance claims for damage to their property. Such confidence of risk cover will also be provided to consumers making a claim for loss or damage to their property through accidents, burglaries, vandalism or other mishaps.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">There are commercial practicalities and efficiencies for general insurers to determine their terms and conditions upfront in a standard form contract. The bill does not seek to interfere with these industry practices. But it does seek to provide a balance by offering protection to consumers who have little or no bargaining strength and are ‘contract takers’ consumers who may unknowingly accept unfair terms hidden in the contract’s fine print.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The bill has two objectives: to prevent an unfair term forming part of a standard form contract in the first instance, and to provide a process for consumers to seek a remedy where an insurer seeks to rely on an unfair term.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The bill meets these objectives in several ways.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">First, in drafting their standard form contracts, or in reviewing existing contracts for renewal, insurers will have a clear incentive not to draft terms that are unfair towards consumers.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Secondly, the Australian Securities and Investments Commission (ASIC) can guide insurers on good practice in the fair construct of their standard form contracts.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Thirdly, consumers and ASIC will both be able to ask a court to declare that a term in a standard form contract is unfair. If a court declares that a term is unfair, it can award the most appropriate remedy to the aggrieved consumer.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Fourthly, such a declaration will protect other consumers because, going forward, the insurer would be expected to change their application of the contract, or amend the unfair term in all new or renewed contracts of that type.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Under the Insurance Contracts Act, insurers already have a number of statutory obligations towards policyholders, and vice versa. These will continue to operate and are taken into account in the new regime.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">A core existing obligation is a duty to act with the utmost duty of good faith towards the other party. The proposed unfair contract terms regime would make it explicit that a general insurer fails to comply with this duty in relation to a standard form consumer contract of general insurance if a court declares a term in the contract to be unfair, or the insurer relies on a term that has been declared unfair. An insurer will not be able to rely on a term that is declared unfair.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This nonreliance remedy differs from the core remedy in the existing unfair contract terms regimes which makes a term void if it is declared unfair. The remedy of voiding an unfair term affects all standard form contracts that use that term whereas the remedy of nonreliance only affects the particular standard form consumer contract of general insurance that is the subject of the declaration.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This acknowledges the financial practicalities for insurers were a term to be made void across all standard form contracts when the cost of making those claims has not been taken into account in pricing those contracts. In contrast, the remedy of nonreliance, by applying to a particular contract, will not have a large-scale retrospective effect and will allow insurers to adjust their contracts on a prospective basis.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The bill defines a term to be unfair where there is significant imbalance in the parties’ rights and obligations, the term is not reasonably necessary to protect the legitimate interests of the advantaged party, and it would cause detriment, whether financial or otherwise, to a party if it were to be applied or relied on.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The onus of proving that a term is reasonably necessary to protect a legitimate interest will be on the advantaged party, and an insurer will be taken to have established this if they prove that the term reasonably reflects their underwriting risk in relation to the particular contract under review.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Consistent with the current unfair contract terms regime applying to other products, a term in a standard form contract will be unaffected to the extent it defines the main subject matter of the contract, the upfront price payable or where a term is expressly permitted by Commonwealth, state or territory law.</span>

                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">ASIC will be able to use the supervisory powers it has in relation to the unfair contract terms regime under the ASIC Act. Certain supervisory powers in the Insurance Contracts Act will not be available in administering the new regime. This will prevent any duplication or conflicts between ASIC's enforcement of the unfair contract terms regime for general insurance and other financial products.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">A transition period of twelve months is provided from the day the act receives royal assent. The new regime will apply to standard form contracts of general insurance that are renewed or varied after that commencement day, or to terms varied after that day.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The bill follows the regulatory path laid down in mid 2010 to give consumers and regulators the right to take action for unfair terms in other standard form contracts. Since then, Australia's consumer agencies have provided guidance about industries’ obligations under the national unfair contract terms laws and worked with them to improve terms and conditions in standard form consumer contracts. For example, the Australian Competition and Consumer Commission has recently conducted reviews of standard form contracts in the telecommunications and vehicle rental industries and engaged with key traders to facilitate amendments to unfair contract terms.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The bill will provide more confidence to consumers that they will be treated fairly when making an insurance claim under a standard form consumer contract of general insurance. This increased consumer protection comes from the incentive for insurers to improve the fairness of the terms and conditions in standard form consumer contracts. It is backed by the possibility of a court remedy where a term is declared unfair.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">In preparing the bill, there has been considerable engagement with stakeholders. In March 2010, my predecessor, the Hon. Chris Bowen MP, released an options paper on unfair terms in insurance contracts. Since late 2010, I have held a number of meetings with stakeholders on the options available, convened a roundtable discussion of key stakeholders and there has been public consultation on a draft regulation impact statement. The bill has been through an exposure draft process which resulted in changes being made in finalising the bill.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I take the opportunity to thank all stakeholders for their active and constructive engagement in this policy and legislative development process.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I can also inform the House that the Council of Australian Governments’ Legislative and Governance Forum on Corporations has been consulted on the bill.</span>

                    </a>  by leave—I thank the House. The 10th report of 2013 of the Parliamentary Joint Committee on Human Rights sets out to the committee's consideration of 13 bills introduced into the parliament from 17 June to 20 June 2013, 140 legislative instruments registered with the Federal Register of Legislative Instruments, the FRLI, between 18 May and 7 June 2013 and 42 responses from the Prime Minister, ministers and private members and senators. The committee considers that none of the bills considered appears to give rise to human rights concerns. Some of these bills do not engage human rights, some engage and promote rights and a number of engage and limit rights but are accompanied by the statements of compatibility that set out an adequate justification for each of these limitations.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The committee notes that the Tax Laws Amendment (2013 Measures No. 3) Bill 2013 proposes a number of civil penalty provisions. However, the statement of compatibility does not assess whether these provisions are properly characterised as civil or criminal under human rights law. The committee will write to the Treasurer to draw his attention to the committee's recently issued interim practice note 2 that sets out the type of analysis it considers may be appropriate to include in statements of compatibility accompanying bills that introduce or incorporate civil penalty regimes.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The committee has identified six instruments that do not appear to raise any human rights concerns but are accompanied by statements of compatibility, or SoCs, that do not fully meet the committee's expectations. The committee will write to the relevant minister in a purely advisory capacity. The committee has decided to seek further information from the relevant ministers in relation to two further instruments before forming a view about their compatibility with human rights.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The committee has considered 42 responses to comments made in various previous reports. The committee has concluded its consideration of 16 bills and 15 instruments, as the responses received relating to this legislation appear to have adequately addressed the committee's concerns or further information is unlikely to be elicited. The committee has made comments in relation to a further 14 responses and in some cases has recommended that a more detailed review of the human rights compatibility of the relevant legislative regime be undertaken.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">On behalf of the committee, I would like to thank all ministers, members and senators who have responded to the committee's request for further information over the course of the 13 months since the committee tabled its first report in June 2012. For the most part, these responses have been prompt and detailed, and for the most part have addressed the committee's concerns, and the committee is grateful for the cooperation it has received.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The committee's 11th report of 2013 sets out the committee's examination of the Stronger Futures in the Northern Territory Act and related legislation. The consideration of this package of legislation has been formative for the committee. The bills were introduced into the parliament on 23 November 2011 before the establishment of the committee. On 15 June 2012, while the bills were before the Senate and before the committee had tabled its first report, the National Congress of Australia's First Peoples wrote to the committee asking it to examine the bills. As this request came so early in the life of the committee, the committee took some time to determine how it would approach the examination of the complex issues and human rights principles involved. I would like to acknowledge the patience and goodwill extended to the committee by the national congress.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">As the bills were introduced prior to the requirement for an SoC, the committee's first step was to write to the Minister for Families, Housing, Community Services and Indigenous Affairs to seek her advice on the compatibility of the bills with human rights. The committee thanks the minister for providing such a detailed and prompt response. The committee decided not to hold public hearings or formally invite submissions as part of its examination of this legislation. The committee noted that the Senate Community Affairs Legislation Committee had already examined the legislation in detail and had received over 400 submissions during that inquiry. After considering these submissions, the committee determined that this body of evidence provided a solid basis from which to carry out its examination of the human rights capability of the legislation. It was in this way that the committee came to appreciate the value of working in a way that complements the work of other parliamentary committees, rather than slavishly adhering to preconceived notions of committee inquiry. The committee is satisfied that its approach in this regard is not only efficient but respectful of the work of those other committees and of the time and resources of those stakeholders who engage with them.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The committee has approached its consideration of the human rights implications of the policies implemented through this package of legislation using the same analytical framework that it consistently applies to the assessment of limitations of rights in any bill or instrument that comes before it. Through its consideration of the measures in this legislation, the committee has focused on the same three key questions: firstly, whether the measures are aimed at achieving a legitimate objective; secondly, whether there is a rational connection between the measures and that objective; and thirdly, whether the measures are proportionate to that objective. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The package of legislation implements a range of measures. However, the committee has focused on three measures: the tackling alcohol abuse measures, the income management measure and the school attendance measure. It has indicated that it considers that these measures require careful monitoring and it has observed that the committee could usefully perform an ongoing oversight role in this regard.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The committee has recommended that in the 44th Parliament, the committee should undertake a 12-month review to evaluate the latest evidence in order to test the continuing necessity of these measures. This report has not specifically addressed issues such as the food security measures relating to the licensing regimes for food stores in certain areas and land reform measures and amendments relating to customary law issues. However, the committee considers that any future monitoring of the implementation of this legislation by this committee would take these issues into account.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This committee, like the committee's 9th report of 2013 on its examination of the migration legislation, exemplifies the merit of the committee's work. Like the 9th report, this 11th report is a consensus report and reflects a careful and principled response to the human rights issues raised by this legislation. I do not propose to paraphrase the report's findings. On previous occasions I have exalted members to read the committee's reports in their entirety. To cherry-pick the committee's conclusions is to fail to appreciate the sober and considered way in which the committee has approached its task.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This is the last tabling statement I will make on behalf of this committee. I take this opportunity to thank all of those who have served on the committee since it was established in March. The original members of the committee were the member for Hasluck, who has been the deputy chair—a finer deputy chair I could not have asked for in this very considerable and awesome task. The other members of the original committee were Senator Sean Edwards, Senator Gary Humphries, the member for Fremantle, Senator Ursula Stephens, the member for Wannon, Senator Matt Thistlethwaite, the member for Wills and Senator Penny Wright. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">With the member for Fremantle, the member for Wills and Senator Thistlethwaite, we sent them on to greatness and they became parliamentary secretaries. Along the way, we have had some new members join us: Senator Anne Ruston, Senator Dean Smith, the member for Moreton and the member for Makin. I thank all of those members for the way in which they have taken a very collegiate view of our work. This is going to be a very important continuing committee of this parliament. It fits well into the human rights framework that was put in place by the government. And I pay tribute to the member for Barton, who I may have overlooked by mistake in my valedictory. Robert should be very pleased with his work on the human rights framework. It was part of the response to the Brennan committee and it was decided that we would legislate for this committee, and it is really a great credit to a member of executive government and to the executive government that we have this parliamentary scrutiny. In addition, I place on record my thanks to Nicola Roxon because she was the one that tapped me on the shoulder and asked me whether I would take on this task. The favourite word of the committee is 'awesome'. I did not actually realise how awesome the task was going to be. It was a learning curve for me, but it has really made my last year and a bit really worth while in this place and I thank her for that opportunity.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">All this work would not have happened if we did not have a dedicated secretariat. Before I go on to making comments about the secretariat, can I say that this secretariat exemplifies the best of parliamentary secretariats throughout the parliament. In saying that, I note that all secretariats have a high standard. Now the importance of making this statement is, of course, that this is a secretariat coming out of the Senate. I have moved a long way. I am now a champion of the fact that it is one parliament, two houses, or two houses, one parliament. I apologise but I have not focus-grouped whether it should be one way or the other. But the thing is that, whilst we have two houses, we are doing the work of the one parliament and, whilst we have the rivalries across Members Hall of the two chambers, it is important to understand that we are two parts of one whole and it is the one whole that for me is the most important.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">So I thank the people that have worked for the committee in the last 13 to 14 months. First of all, I would like to thank Lauren McDougall, 'Doogs', who did see the light—my having said this about the two houses—and has come across to the House secretariat system and is with the Joint Foreign Affairs, Defence and Trade Grouping. She was really a terrific help because she was there when there were only two people working for us. We then have Glenn Ryall, who is a senior research officer. Glenn is doing postgraduate studies at the ANU and I wish him well with those continuing studies and thank him. Anita Coles, a principal research officer, came out of Senate administration and she has knowledge of their scrutiny of bills. She has played a considerable role in the committee's work. Renuka Thilagaratnam has had a long association with the committee because she was in AG's when we were undergoing the training that Attorney-General's gave throughout the Public Service. Renuka really knows her stuff but, importantly, she has actually adapted to parliamentary life and the importance of taking a parliamentary view. I really thank her for her ability to do that, to actually know the way in which we would like to construct our work. The committee appointed an external legal adviser and we were lucky enough to get Professor Andrew Byrnes on board. He had been one of the stakeholders before coming on as the external legal adviser. I hope that he has not been too traumatised by adjusting to the parliamentary environment when has been doing his work for the committee. He has such a vast knowledge of human rights law and its application and he has been of great assistance. Finally, I come to Jeanette Radcliffe, who is the secretary. Fortunately for me, while I knew few Senate bureaucrats I knew Jeanette because she had been the delegation secretary on IPU assemblies, so that was a good start. She has done an—again our favourite word—awesome job in building this committee from a greenfields site to be so successful a committee and I hope that the hard work that she has put in is rewarded so that in the 44th Parliament this committee continues to be one of the important committees of the parliament. So to all those people—the members and the secretariat—I thank them for the dedicated and principled way in which they have all approached their job. It simply has been awe-inspiring.</span>

                    <span class="HPS-MemberContinuation">Mr JENKINS:</span>
                  </a>  I thank the House. This was the ASEAN delegation—that is why we went to those three countries. I am proud that, in another guise in this place, myself and the President of the Senate, John Hogg, decided that there should be a rolling program of delegations to ASEAN countries throughout the life of this parliament. I hope that this continues.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">These are three countries with which we have very good relationships. In Vietnam, we were able to go to the Mekong Delta, which is of course a great potential food bowl. They really are happy to receive the assistance of our great agriculturalists. I see the parliamentary secretary and the shadow minister at the table. Australia should really be proud of the way in which it can share its technology in agriculture not only with our region but throughout the globe. I know that this is a bipartisan thrust in this place and that it will continue.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">With Singapore we have such a great relationship. The delegation got to meet two very powerful women members of parliament: the Second Minister for Foreign Affairs, Grace Fu, and the new Speaker, Halimah Yacob. It was just terrific to be able to speak to those two.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Then we moved on to Indonesia. Despite all the political to-ing and fro-ing across this chamber, our relationship with Indonesia is at its highest point and very strong. I just hope that when the new administration comes in, post Susilo Bambang Yudhoyono, it continues to be. We had a meeting with Vice President Boedion; we have the advantage, of course, that he was educated in Australia. They know and understand us. We were lucky enough to go to Surabaya. Can I urge anybody that is a decision-maker in the future for Australia to see the potential of Surabaya as a place we really should do business and get to understand.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Finally, I have to mention that in Indonesia we met with the speaker of the Upper House. I am saddened to report to the chamber that Taufiq Kiemas died earlier this month. Taufiq Kiemas was the husband of former President Megawati. He was a substantial political figure—that has been recognised; and President Yudhoyono has paid great respect, even though he and Megawati are political opponents. Taufiq really played his role in the emerging parliamentary democracy in Indonesia, and it is a sad note to realise that a man who gave so generously of his time back then in April is no longer with us.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">In conclusion I congratulate Senator Alex Gallacher from South Australia who, while a junior in the time he has spent in parliament, was such a terrific leader. He had to put up with not only myself but the member for Moore and the member for Hinkler. We were a really solid delegation and drew on the experiences we have had in this place to try to ensure the continuing strong bilateral relationships with these three ASEAN countries and, through that, the continuing strong parliamentary relationship between ASEAN countries and Australia. I thank the House for allowing me this indulgence.</span>

                    <span class="HPS-MemberContinuation">Mr SLIPPER:</span>
                  </a>  It was my privilege to lead the delegation to the IPU, as Speaker of the House of Representatives, in Uganda, and on the bilateral visits to Kazakhstan and Hungary. Given the disparate parts of the world in which these countries are situated, travel was somewhat of a challenge. But, I have to say that, as with all parliamentary delegations from this place, there was a great sense of camaraderie amongst the delegates—party affiliations of course were put aside—and everyone worked very well together as representatives of this parliament, and indeed this nation. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The deputy leader of the delegation was the honourable member for Lyons and he attended the IPU and the visit to Kazakhstan. Senator Ursula Stephens had planned to visit but because of illness of a family member was unable to be present. The other members of the delegation included Senator Sue Boyce, the now Chief Government Whip, and the honourable member for Barker. Because we were going on to Hungary and there was no government representative, I would like to thank the honourable member for Fowler for stepping in at the last minute to participate as part of that delegation. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The delegation was also accompanied by Tim Knapp, an adviser in my office when I was Speaker of the House of Representatives, and Ms Claressa Surtees from the Department of the House of Representatives attended matters associated with the IPU. I would like to place on record my thanks to Ms Jeanette Radcliffe from the Department of the Senate, who was the delegation secretary. The delegation was also accompanied by my wife, Inge; Ms Dee Alty, the partner of the honourable member for Lyons; Ms Sharon Secker. Ms Bernadette Hayes accompanied her husband for the part of the visit that he was present for.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I have to say that the IPU is one of those very worthwhile institutions where there is a two-way exchange of ideas. We as a developed, First World country, obviously have a lot to contribute, but that does not mean that we have a monopoly on good ideas and common sense. There was full participation in every aspect of the assembly, and I must say that I was particularly proud that members of our delegation took key roles in participating in various aspects of what was happening.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">While in Uganda, I was invited to a private meeting with the President at the state house. It was a very interesting experience to be conveyed at a very high rate of speed from Kampala to the state house, where we had a 40-minute meeting and the President happily reminisced about his visit to the Sunshine Coast for CHOGM. He reminisced about a whole range of matters and we largely listened; it was pretty clear that the President thinks very well of Australia. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I have been critical of governments on both sides of the political divide for inadequately providing enough diplomatic representation for us to have an appropriate footprint for a nation of our size throughout the world. That is one of the reasons we as a country have found it so difficult to be elected as a non-permanent member of the UN Security Council; because, compared to many of the countries that come along to vote, we do not have resident representation.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I raise that in the context of Kazakhstan and also the recent budget decision made by the government to close the embassy and Hungary which I believe is one of the most stupid decisions that any government has made, given the fact that the embassy will close two weeks before the election on 14 September and given the bilateral connections that we have with Hungary with 260,000 people of Hungarian or part-Hungarian origin making a wonderful contribution to this nation. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">To visit Kazakhstan and go to Astana was a very interesting experience. We did have the opportunity of meeting with a range of people at a very high level and it was obvious that, although Australia has no representation officially other than a consulate in Almaty and Kazakhstan does not have any resident diplomatic presence in Australia, the two countries have a lot to offer. We do have a lot in common and I have to say that the program was put together was one which was appreciated by all honourable members. I think it was a very worthwhile program. We got to meet the chairman of both the houses of the Kazakh parliament. We got to visit a whole range of places and we were able to settle Australia's image very well in that country. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I want to place on record my appreciation to Her Excellency the Hungarian Ambassador to Australia, Ms Anna Siko, because she actually accompanied the delegation. I also want to thank Mr John Griffin who is the current Australian ambassador to Hungary. I was shocked when the budget was announced that despite the fact Australia and Hungary have these close relationships we are going to lose our diplomatic presence in that country. Hungary, after all, is an important country in central Europe. It is in many respects a gateway to the EU and central Europe for Australia and Australia is a gateway for Hungary into the Asia-Pacific region.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">In Hungary we met the Speaker of the parliament; the minister for foreign affairs; Mr Orban, the Prime Minister of Hungary and the Deputy Prime Minister. Essentially in both Kazakhstan and Hungary all doors were open to us. I would also like to thank Ms Twomey who was the non-resident ambassador to Kazakhstan based in Moscow because she also was of incredible assistance to us.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I have placed on record that while I think that there are many evils in our world, there is no evil worse than anti-Semitism. I have to say that I was privileged to participate in the March of the Living in Budapest which celebrated the 100th anniversary of the birth of Raoul Wallenberg. The Australian ambassador accompanied us. The Hungarian ambassador to Australia was there. The acting President of Hungary was there. I thought it was a very clever action on the part of our ambassador to Hungary because he managed to position the Australian flag on the stage in a way that no-one could doubt our support for the wonderful work that Raoul Wallenberg carried out, saving from the gas chambers so many people and ultimately, of course, as we all know he lost his life after the war at the hands of the Soviets. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I would like to thank the work of Mr Geoff Barnett, the international community relations office person who was our link person and Mr Tony Styles from the Department of the Senate. He was also of excellent assistance to the committee.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">In closing, I had planned, as Speaker of the House of Representatives, to lead the delegation to the IPU meeting in Quebec. I know the report is going to be given by my colleague the honourable member for Lyons. I must say my bag was packed. I felt a bit as did the honourable member for Hunter when he lost his position and therefore lost the opportunity of visiting another IPU, but the member for Lyons stepped in willingly and, from all reports that I have had, carried out his responsibilities as leader of that delegation admirably.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I thank the House for its indulgence. I want to place on record that I think we should have more delegations from Australia going abroad and more incoming delegations. As Speaker, I endeavoured to engage with the diplomatic community, and I think that that was appreciated by the diplomatic community. We have to understand that sending delegations overseas is a relatively cheap cost to our nation for the goodwill that those delegations build up in the countries visited. I thank the House.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">
                  <a href="BV5" type="MemberSpeech">
                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Mr ADAMS</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Lyons</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">10:56</span>):  I present the report of the Australian parliamentary delegation to the 127th conference of the Inter-Parliamentary Union, held in Quebec City, Canada, from 13 to 28 October 2012 and the bilateral visit to Argentina. I ask leave of the House to make short statement in connection with the report.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">
                  <a href="BV5" type="MemberContinuation">
                    <span class="HPS-MemberContinuation">Mr ADAMS:</span>
                  </a>  Between 13 and 28 October 2012, it was my pleasure to lead the Australian parliamentary delegation that attended the 127th Inter-Parliamentary Union Assembly in Quebec City, Quebec, Canada. Prior to the assembly, the delegation undertook a bilateral visit to Argentina.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">This report details the work undertaken by the delegation at the IPU and on the bilateral visit to Argentina. The bilateral visit provided an opportunity for the delegation to engage on issues of significance to Australia and to Argentina, including free trade, nuclear nonproliferation and disarmament, renewable energy and strengthening of the parliamentary relationship. Argentina is a very interesting country and was compared with Australia in the early 1900s, both being countries of great potential. Argentina certainly has great potential now. It has had 30 years of democracy since what were referred to as the 'dirty wars', and we wish it well in the future.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The Australian delegation participated fully in the work of the IPU throughout the 127th assembly, taking part in various debates and meetings and acting as chairs of plenary sessions and workshops. I contributed to the assembly's special debate on citizenship, identity and linguistic and cultural diversity in a globalised world, during which I was able to emphasise the various ways in which Australia has sought to recognise and celebrate its diversity and multicultural society and ensure that all members of society have a voice in Australia's democratic system.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Once again, the Australian delegation was sought after to take an active leadership role in the work of the assembly, reflecting the high esteem in which Australia, the Australian parliament and parliamentarians are held. Senator Ursula Stephens participated in the work of the third standing committee, which discussed the use of media, including social media, to enhance citizen engagement in democracy. Mr Patrick Secker and I participated in the work of the Second Standing Committee on Sustainable Development, Finance and Trade, where we both spoke on the theme of fair trade and innovative financing mechanisms for sustainable development. Senator Sue Boyce participated in the work of the first standing committee, which discussed the theme 'Enforcing the responsibility to protect: the role of parliament in safeguarding civilians' lives'. Mr Joel Fitzgibbon, with support from Mr Jenkins and Mr Secker, chaired an informal meeting to discuss the formation of an international network of whips and others with organisational responsibility within parliaments as a focus point for democratic processes around the world. Mr Fitzgibbon and Mr Jenkins participated in the work of the IPU on the United Nations committee of the IPU, and Mr Jenkins participated in the committee's roundtable discussions on multilateralism and the role of parliamentary democracy. In the discussion on the UN's Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples five years on, he chaired the workshop in that area.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">There are many issues within the IPU that were dealt with, especially one about gender-sensitive parliaments. Many parts of the world do not have many women, if they have women at all, as representatives. Those are being focused on by the UN and also the IPU. I think we have issues within our own region which need to be identified and we need to make sure that we are aware of that within Australia and the Australian context generally.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The Australian and New Zealand delegations held a lunch with delegates from Micronesia, Timor-Leste and Tonga to discuss the engagement of Pacific Island parliaments in the work of the IPU. The Australian delegation also had a bilateral discussion with members of the delegations from Ireland and Serbia. We have a lot of history with Ireland with migration to Australia and the formation of the country.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">On behalf of the delegation I express my sincere thanks to the parliament of Canada for the great assembly they put on. It was very effective and very efficiently run. Australia has so much in common in policy terms with Canada and it is always a pleasure to go there and spend time with their MPs. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The delegation undertook a bilateral visit to Argentina, as I mentioned. That was a comprehensive program meeting with Australian businesses in Argentina, particularly in the mining sector and the energy sectors. The delegation was welcomed and we had very good, frank discussions on those issues. Argentina does not seem to have the history of mining that we have, though it has great potential to do so and has some very successful mining taking place. The delegation would like to acknowledge Senator Sonia Escudero for the time and the assistance which she extended to the delegation during its stay. She is certainly a great friend of Australia. The delegation expresses its sincere appreciation to the Argentine parliament and the government of San Juan province for providing such a rich and engaging program for the time that we spent with them. It was very stimulating and there were great discussions with the provincial government. They are certainly go-ahead, looking to use innovation and especially knowledge and data to help formulate their policy positions. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I would also like to acknowledge the support given by our diplomatic representatives in Canada and Argentina. Both missions are to be commended for their work and careful attention to detail to make the delegation's visit a success. The previous speaker mentioned the opportunities for Australia and, being a member of the foreign affairs committee, I think its report brought down in this parliament gives us a direction for new opportunities and new posts where Australia needs to be putting its energy and money for the future and for where we will be in the world and what is in the interests of the country.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I also express gratitude to the ambassador to Argentina, Patricia Holmes, and her staff at the Australian embassy for their part in arranging the delegation's program, the briefings and arrangements. They were particularly good and I thank her very much. I also thank Mr Lucas Robson, first secretary to the Australian high commission in Ottawa, for his advice and practical assistance in Quebec. It helped us a great deal. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The delegation wishes to thank the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade and the Parliamentary Library for comprehensive and formal written briefings prior to the delegation's departure. Special thanks go to the International and Community Relations Office for its logistics work in getting us organised. To Jeanette Radcliffe, secretary to the delegation, I offer special thanks for helping us get through and keep a direction of what we were doing. Finally, I would like to thank my fellow delegates for their participation in this delegation. It was a very full program with 12-to-14-hour days and early geopolitical meetings starting at eight every morning. You never go backwards in those meetings. So I thank them for their hard work and commend the report to the House.</span>

                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">

                      <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Mr JOHN COBB</span>
                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Calare</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">11:07</span>):  I rise to speak on the Rural Research and Development Legislation Amendment Bill 2013 and cognate bills. The bills will implement a number of changes to the research and development corporations which will, hopefully, facilitate small but positive improvements to these organisations to continue the proactive evolution of research and development for agriculture and agribusiness.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The amending legislation allows statutory RDCs to undertake marketing activities where the relevant industry requests this and agrees to raise a marketing levy. Currently, nine of the 15 RDCs are industry owned and can undertake marketing activities. The amending legislation will allow the remaining RDCs to also undertake marketing activities. This does not impact on government matching funds, which can only be applied and used for research and development activity. However, industry owned RDCs have demonstrated that benefits can result from combining these roles.<span style="font-weight:bold;"></span>These bills make arrangements for providing government matching funding for voluntary contributions made by industry to an RDC. Again, a number of RDCs already do this and the arrangement will be extended to all RDCs.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Industry clearly recognises that research and development investment returns far outweigh the costs. These changes are intended to encourage voluntary private sector investment in rural R&amp;D and to ensure equal treatment of RDCs by government. The bills will provide maximum levy and charge rates for each specific commodity, to reduce the cost and delay associated with primary industry electing to increase their investment in R&amp;D and/or marketing.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The requirement for the minister to consult with and take account of the views of levy payers when setting operative rates will be strengthened. The minister will be prevented, as he should, from setting a levy or charge rate above that recommended by industry. For statutory RDCs, board selection processes will be streamlined to reduce the time and cost of vacancies.<span style="font-weight:bold;"></span>This includes cutting the size of selection committees and creating a reserve list of suitable candidates to allow for the unforeseen circumstance where the preferred board member pulls out or serves a very short tenure. Amendments also provide that funding agreements between statutory RDCs and government will be required from July 2014. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Over the last decade, funding agreements between the government and industry owned RDCs have been used to manage governance and clarify partner arrangements. This bill extends funding agreements to the government relationship with statutory RDCs. Funding agreements create a flexible mechanism, which can be further modified to reflect the changing needs of the parties. Funding agreements will be used to promote transparency and accountability, and these agreements will be tabled in the parliament.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Another change will see statutory RDCs no longer having to submit their annual operating plans to the minister for approval. The minister will still get the operating plans but industry will not be required to wait for his approval every year, as governance issues will already have been managed through funding agreements.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The Primary Industries and Energy and Research and Development Act 1989 will be amended to clarify funding arrangements for fisheries sectors which have a statutory levy in place that is specific to that sector. The amendment will allow the future establishment of levies for individual fisheries sectors, where requested by that industry. The amending legislation also incorporates a widely supported 1995 ministerial direction requiring the fisheries RDC to spend industry funds raised from a particular fishery, industry sector or jurisdiction on R&amp;D projects relevant to the source funds.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The government conspired with the Productivity Commission to cut R&amp;D funding, but I am very happy to say that industry and the coalition shamed them out of it. In an effort to regain credibility on R&amp;D, the minister put out a research and development policy statement in June. These changes to legislation are an effort to show that Labor are now doing something in this area and are trying to get the public to overlook six years of neglect, along with policies from the government that have caused immense problems for industry and destroyed the confidence of this sector. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">One thing that the Productivity Commission report showed was that the Australian taxpayer gets good value out of R&amp;D—to some extent, this bill deals with that issue—and also that we can get a better result out of research and development by the various RDCs and the various industries working together better, and I think that is needed.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The biggest issue with this legislation is the haste with which Labor is pushing everything through in the last week before we rise. Industry has had little time to review the changes, given the legislation has only been available for industry for a little over a week. Consultation has been far less than that required for good process. We will allow the bill to pass through this House, but we do reserve the right for the Senate to perhaps demand an inquiry to allow the coalition to get the assurance that industry supports this legislation. We are happy with the bill as read in this House.</span>

                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Lyons</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">11:14</span>):  The Rural Research and Development Legislation Amendment Bill 2013, the Primary Industries (Excise) Levies Amendment Bill 2013 and the Primary Industries (Customs) Charges Amendment Bill 2013 amend 10 acts within the Agriculture, Fisheries and Forestry portfolio to implement the government's rural research and development policy. The acts being amended are primarily the Primary Industries and Energy Research and Development Act 1989, the Primary Industries (Excise) Levies Act 1999 and the Primary Industries (Customs) Charges Act 1999. They also include the Pig Industry Act 2001, the Dairy Produce Act 1986, the Egg Industry Service Provisions Act 2002, the Wool Services Privatisation Act 2000, the Forestry Marketing and Research and Development Services Act 2007, the Horticulture Marketing and Research and Development Services Act 2000 and the Australian Meat and Live-stock Industry Act 1997.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Currently there are 15 RDCs—six statutory RDCs and nine industry owned RDCs—providing services to a diverse range of rural industries. RDCs provide a mechanism for industry to invest collectively in research and development, and in marketing in the case of industry owned RDCs. The shadow minister mentioned the Productivity Commission's report, and that highlighted the need for more money to be provided in the sector from the private sector and that the investment of public dollars is used to leverage more investment in R&amp;D for rural Australia. I think that these bills will help us in that direction following on from that Productivity Commission report.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The Australian government assists these industries by establishing a levy if any industry so requests by collecting the levy and by returning the funds to the relevant RDC, less the cost of collection. In addition, the government matches the RDCs' eligible R&amp;D spending up to the legislated limits. The amendments will assist the RDCs to deliver improved services to levy payers and to lift the productivity of Australia's rural industries, including the agriculture, fisheries and forestry industries.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The bills will improve the efficiency, transparency and accountability of the rural research and development corporations and make technical amendments. The amendments aim to assist the RDCs to deliver improved services to levy payers and to lift the productivity of statutory funding agreements for the RDCs. This is proposed to drive performance improvements and increase transparency in the delivery of the R&amp;D services. Funding agreements have been a flexible mechanism to provide government guidance and oversight to industry owned RDCs. These amendments will extend that mechanism to statutory RDCs.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Amendments in the bill change the process for selection of statutory RDC board directors to improve transparency and efficiency. The amendments promote due consideration of diversity in the selection process. These amendments aim to ensure high-quality boards for RDCs and reduce the time and delay associated with securing them. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The bill proposes to allow the collection and matching of individual fishery industry levies, subject to the cap based on the gross value of production of that individual fishery. This will allow specific fisheries to propose levies to invest in R&amp;D in their industry and to undertake marketing in a similar way to other rural commodities.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Part of the bill seeks to remove redundant sections of the Primary Industries and Energy Research and Development Act 1989, including those relating to the RDCs and R&amp;D funds which no longer exist. For example, they changed the name of the Primary Industry and Energy Research and Development Act 1989 and removed energy because there is no energy research agency currently covered by the act. Energy research is now part of the Resources, Energy and Tourism portfolio.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The amendments will not change any levy or change rates that are in operation at the moment, but they will streamline the process for changing rates in the future. Levies and charges may be increased following a request by the industry that will not be allowed to be set above the rate recommended by the industry. This will allow industries to manage their collective investment in research and marketing while also providing a safeguard for levy payers against arbitrary increases in rates.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">One of the things we recognise with rural bills is the constant need for rural and regional research not only at the industry level. This was reinforced yesterday when I had a visit from the Regional Australia Institute, who showed me a new online tool for assessing regional liability, called Insight. I have to recommend it to all, because it does not matter which side of the House one is on; we all need to know how we can help regions prosper. Knowledge is strength and it can help you predict more accurately how your region, your local government area or your state will travel in the future. It can make comparisons, add information and develop policy. Along with knowledge, we need to have efficiency, transparency and accountability in legislation so that research and development information is available to guide and innovate our rural and regional industries, hopefully beyond the politics of the day.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Take, for example, the Forest Marketing and Research and Development Services Act. The forest industry is going through all sorts of changes at the moment and there need to be ways to assist the industry to capitalise on the opportunities presented by its sustainable products. Unlocking their potential requires innovative skills and the key ingredients of innovation are learning and workforce development. The sorts of skills needed and the direction in which the industry might head can be determined by ensuring the research is up to speed. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">In my position as chair of the Standing Committee on Agriculture, Resources, Fisheries and Forestry, it seems that most of the recommendations made during our various inquiries have elements of pointing to the need for more research. There is also encouragement to ensure that levies are raised to undertake the research that particular industries need to develop their plans for the future, not in isolation but in the region in which they operate. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">While on the question of the ARFF committee, I pay tribute to the work of the member for Hume, Alby Schultz, my opposite number on the committee, who is retiring from the House and who made his valedictory speech only yesterday. I take this opportunity to thank him for his work on the committee in his role as deputy chair and previously as chair. He has been of enormous support to me as deputy chair. Our work over the years, although not always agreeing, has been able to find a common way through. Our committee has achieved some excellent research for the parliament and there has nearly always been bipartisan support. So thank you, Alby, and we wish you all the best for the future.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">These bills are mainly small in the sense of change but they ensure the modernisation of legislation, taking out the redundant parts and pulling some of the levies under one umbrella to give some more flexibility, all of which gives the industry a greater opportunity to undertake work that will put it in a more viable space for the future and helpfully promote our regional industries. I commend the bills to the House.</span>

                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">
                    <a href="EM6" type="MemberSpeech">
                      <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Dr STONE</span>
                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Murray</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">11:23</span>):  I too wish to speak on the Primary Industries (Customs) Charges Amendment Bill 2013, the Primary Industries (Excise) Levies Amendment Bill 2013 and the Rural Research and Development Legislation Amendment Bill 2013, which are being considered here. Obviously, these bills are of critical importance to my part of the world, where our economy is underpinned by agricultural production. That production, in turn, depends on innovation, well-funded research and industry development. We have gone through a very bad period when our different state and federal governments have pulled back from what were sometimes 80- or 90-year-old research stations. We have seen a lot of the CSIRO effort in rural and regional research no longer funded.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I am concerned, too, about things like plant breeding, which may take literally 20 or 30 years to undertake if, for example, you are looking for a new wheat variety that is particularly suited to our climatic conditions—perhaps in Western Australia. The seed-breeding program that used to be in place in Western Australia brought forward for Australia a whole new focus on quality and higher yields. For example, the noodle wheats in Western Australia, wheats like Eromanga, were evolved as a consequence of the state-supported seed-breeding program. Much of that is now lost and the business of breeding new varieties is too often in the hands of research organisations commercial and not based in Australia, and so they have other conditions attached to the buying of those varieties. It is no longer always the case that farmers can use their own seed for replanting, for example. Too often there are highly restricted conditions around the seeds—patenting or licensing. This business of research and development—including the levies raised, matched by government funding in this case—is a most important matter for the future sustainability, evolution and additional productivity in Australia's agriculture.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">What do these bills do? They allow statutory RDCs to undertake marketing at the request of the industry in addition to their more traditional activities. I have a little issue with this. When an RDC does something like promote the eating of fresh fruit or a dairy product, or maybe Australian meats, this tends to increase the shopper uptake of that product. The shopper goes home perhaps with more cans in their trolley or more fruit in their diet. This is a good thing but, of course, imports also benefit from that marketing effort. If the general response to that food category is stimulated by marketing dollars, I have a view that the importing country should also contribute to that marketing effort, particularly in the case of New Zealand, where we have a great deal of two-way flow in food. We have, as we know, under the CER, or Closer Economic Relations, a longstanding arrangement whereby there are no barriers or inhibitions between the two countries in terms of tariffs, duties or quotas. Only phytosanitary considerations are in place. Yet, if RDCs are to raise levies for marketing within Australia to promote, for example, the eating of apples, I think the New Zealand Apple and Pear Marketing Board, the equivalent body, should make a contribution.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The bill will also make sure that the government's matching funding extends to voluntary contributions made by the industry. This change is intended to encourage voluntary private sector investment, and we need to see that across Australia. The bill also removes product specific maximum levy and charge rates to reduce the cost and delay associated with primary industries electing to increase investment in R&amp;D and-or marketing. The minister will be prevented from setting the levy or charge rate above that recommended by industry, and that is a good thing, but all of this is about reducing red tape and putting more control back in the hands of the industry itself. These are important developments, I believe.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The board selection processes are to be altered and, hopefully, improved. There is also going to be a reserve list created for suitable candidates. A selection committee will create this reserve list. It will cut the size of selection committees, reduce expense and delay in filling board vacancies but, importantly, also look at the diversity and gender balance of various boards. It is too often the case that all we see on these RDCs are men and yet, in agriculture in particular—take dairying—you see men and women participating equally in the business of running their farms or, indeed, participating at a high level in industry policy development.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Funding agreements between statutory RDCs and the government will be required from July 2014. These will provide a more flexible mechanism for agreeing governance and performance issues. This will allow timely modification of these arrangements when needed without having to come back for legislative change. It will improve consistency in the government's relationship with RDCs—that is the aim—a bit like local EBAs. I think it can only be good where, if the industry is in agreement and the government is in agreement, you do not have to come back and queue to see legislative change put in the pipeline.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">So these measures look at cutting red tape; they allow marketing to also be an activity of the RDCs although not to have, we understand, government funds put into the marketing arena—just into the R&amp;D activities. That is appropriate and understandable. But we are concerned about the consultation time frame. The industry has had no time to review the legislation and we, the coalition, have hardly had any time at all to look at the issues. There are a large number of stakeholders from very diverse industry sectors who really should have been consulted. There should have been extensive feedback in relation  to these changes.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Perhaps we can still have some feedback. We do need more flexibility and less red tape in this area. We need to increase the funds available for R&amp;D in Australian agribusiness in particular. We have had a real problem of productivity not growing in Australian agribusiness sectors for quite a while. Of course we have had floods, droughts and pestilence—that is for sure—but it is interesting to see the productivity advances being made by our neighbours like New Zealand, but also in Asia. Those productivity increases in the agribusiness sector have been quite astonishing, while in Australia we have been standing still.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I was particularly concerned when our crisis—our tragedy—struck in the Goulburn and Murray valleys, where virtually overnight the canning fruit industry found no market for their produce. We needed to consider quickly what alternative varieties to plant which might have greater market value, or indeed whether there were vegetables or some nut varieties to make best use of the soil types, the climate and the human capital in my part of the world. So we looked around for research and development capacity at the state level, at the federal level and in the private sector, but we found there is in Australia a real dearth of expertise and funded support for research and development in horticulture. We used to have the work of the Tatura Research Institute, which did such amazing things as developing the Tatura trellis system. This revolutionised the way fresh apples and pears were grown. It is a system that has been emulated throughout the world. But that particular place, the Tatura Research Institute, now has virtually no research scientists still employed. Unfortunately their places have been backfilled with public servants who are employed by the Goulburn-Murray Water authority and who unfortunately are highly inefficient and a burden not a help or an assistance in keeping our agribusiness in place given the unconscionable fees and charges that they are now imposing.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We do need to look very hard at research and development activity in Australia. The statutory RDCs are a critical part of that. I also hope that, if we stimulate our statutory RDCs to be more flexible and to also have a marketing focus, they will address or somehow stimulate a younger generation—the next generation of people working in primary industries. We have so much distress and concern in horticulture. Our dairy industry are hardly making any return above their costs of production. We have a serious problem in many parts of our country with the costs of doing business. Whether it is energy charges, veterinary supplies, farm chemicals of any description or fertiliser, the costs confronting our primary industry sector are making us less competitive, and that is without even starting to discuss the labour costs in Australia compared with our competitors.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">So research and development is critical. We once led the world in innovation in our seed-breeding and in our livestock genetic development. We supplied the world with the most superior genetics in our wool-producing sheep varieties. We developed cattle species that are able to survive in tropical Australia and can resist ticks. These cattle have a virtually disease-free status compared with other varieties of cattle who have traditionally been bred in other parts of the tropical Southern Hemisphere. We have done an amazing job in the past but we are now slipping with our research and development effort. That is reflected in our virtual flatlining of productivity growth over the last 10 or so years. It is also reflected in the lack of decent returns for people working in primary industries. It is reflected in the fact that we have a crisis in the next generation's reluctance to take up agribusiness. We have very low levels of investment in food manufacturing or indeed even back on farm.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Perhaps the saddest reflection of all is on the state of our agribusiness or our agricultural science training in universities. Unfortunately, universities now have a funding model which depends on how many students they can seat in their hallowed halls, how many of those students are overseas full fee payers and how many refereed journal articles or pieces of research can be published. Unfortunately, the agricultural science courses do not tick any of those boxes. They are not popular with overseas full-fee-paying students. They are very expensive to run. They do not necessarily lead to additional publishing in refereed journals. These facts are reflected in the collapse in numbers in agricultural science teaching across all of our universities and the near disappearance of institutions like Dookie Agricultural College and other great Victorian institutions—agricultural colleges that, I would argue, trained some of the best agribusiness specialists in the world. Certainly they were in demand as such.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I am concerned about the rush and the lack of consultation in relation to these matters of significance to agribusiness and the future of agriculture in this country. The industry has not had sufficient time to review the legislation, nor has the coalition. However, having said that, I need to say the changes do appear to be positive and I am anxious to see that more work is done in the closing days of this parliament in relation to these issues.</span>

                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Riverina</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">11:36</span>):  It is always a pleasure to follow the member for Murray, who like me represents an agricultural region vast in the variety of produce it produces not only to feed our nation but to feed other nations as well. I know how desperately worried the member for Murray is about a future for farming. These bills are to do with agriculture, and agriculture is under great pressure at the moment through a combination of factors, not least of which is the high Australian dollar. Fortunately, that high Australian dollar is weakening—fortunately, that is, for the farming sector, who rely on overseas importers in order to export their produce at a price that is reasonable and good for them so that they get the maximum price at farm gate. With a high Australian dollar there is a disinclination for those overseas countries to continue to trade with many of our fine farmers.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Australia does have the world's best farmers—there is absolutely no question about that. I know the Parliamentary Secretary for Agriculture, Forestry and Fisheries at the table would concur with me on the fact that Australian farmers are the very best in the world. They are using world's best practice. They are using less water to grow more. Yesterday I commended the member for Braddon, who is the Parliamentary Secretary for Agriculture, Fisheries and Forestry, on the wine-marketing export arrangements—the new statutory body which is being formed. But, unlike with that particular piece of legislation, I do not think that there has been due diligence or sufficient consultation with respect to this bill. It bothers me that in the last few days of this parliament we are seeing this rushed through without the coalition being properly consulted, and moreover without industry bodies and key stakeholders being consulted. They are the ones who are going to wear the effects of any changes and they need to have the comfort and security to know that the government of the day is doing the right thing by them. But I am not certain that they have those assurances.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We have seen agriculture under enormous pressure, and not helped at all times by this government. There has not been the focus on regional Australia that there should have been in this parliament. I hope that in the next parliament, whichever party has the Treasury benches—</span>

                      <span class="HPS-MemberContinuation">Mr McCORMACK:</span>
                    </a>  You do not come from regional Australia and so, quite frankly, would not know. There needs to be a greater emphasis on regional Australia, and I know that the members opposite would agree with me there, whichever party is on the Treasury benches. Regional Australia grows the food to feed this nation and others. Regional Australia is the backbone of this country—it always has been and may it long continue to be. But it is not being shown the respect that it should have been shown.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">These bills will implement the changes to the rural research and development corporations, or RDCs, as the statutory RDCs will be permitted to undertake marketing activities where the relevant industry requests this and agrees to raise a marketing levy. Government matching funds may only be used for research and development activities, but industry owned RDCs have demonstrated that benefits can result from combining these roles. These bills make arrangements for providing government matching funding for voluntary contributions made by industry to an RDC. This change is intended to encourage voluntary private sector investment in rural R&amp;D to ensure equal treatment of RDCs by the government of the day.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I heard Warren Truss, the Nationals leader, saying in answer to a question about foreign investment that one of the reasons why there is so much interest by overseas countries in Australian agriculture is that it is the very best, but more than that there is not the same inclination by Australian companies—and, indeed, superannuation funds and others—to invest in Australian agriculture. That is a pity, because there is a bright future for Australian agriculture. There is a bright future for regional Australia, and it is a shame that more Australian investors do not acknowledge that fact. At the moment we see Archer Daniels Midland, an American company, attempting to take over GrainCorp. There needs to be more investment by governments and certainly by the private sector in Australian agriculture. I heard the member for Murray talking about the R&amp;D factor. Research and development in genetic foods and better farming methods and practices is so very critical. I know the great work that Charles Sturt University, in Wagga Wagga and other regional campuses, is doing in that space.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">These bills will remove product-specific maximum levy and charge rates to reduce the costs and delay associated with primary industries electing to increase their investment in research and development and/or marketing. The requirement for the Minister for Agriculture, Fisheries and Forestry to consult with and take note of the opinions of levy payers when setting operative rates will be maximised, bolstered and strengthened. The minister will be prevented from setting a levy or a charge rate over that recommended by industry. That is not such a bad thing—in fact, it is a necessary thing. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">For statutory RDCs, board selection processes will be changed to reduce the size of selection committees and lower expense and delay in filling board vacancies. That is a good move, too. Selection committees will create a reserve list of appropriate candidates and more emphasis will be put on diversity and gender balance. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Funding agreements between statutory RDCs and government will be required from July next year. Funding agreements will provide a more flexible mechanism for agreeing governance and performance issues, something that I am sure industry will concur with. This will allow timely modification of these arrangements where and when needed without requiring legislative change. It will improve consistency in the government's relationship with RDCs—there is certainly no argument there. To try to match the coalition commitment to cut red tape and moreover green tape and to try to add some substance to Labor's hollow promises to reduce regulation—because we have seen more and more red tape and green tape in this 43rd Parliament—statutory RDCs will no longer have to submit their annual operating plans to the minister for approval.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The bills make several small and minor arrangements to improve consistency in governance between RDCs. They will clarify the role of RDCs and they will simplify the arrangements of governance. The Primary Industries and Energy Research and Development Act 1989 will be changed to clarify funding arrangements for the fishery sectors, which have a statutory levy in place which is specific to that particular sector. This amendment will allow the future establishment of levies for individual fishery sectors where requested by industry. Certainly, the fishing industry has not been at all assisted by this government—locking up marine reserves, the case with the supertrawler which was banned from Australian waters. There are so many factors and so many ways in which this government has disadvantaged the fishing industry, so anything in this will be looked forward to.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The amendments will also incorporate a widely supported 1995 ministerial direction requiring the Fisheries RDC to spend industry funds raised from a particular fishery industry sector or jurisdiction on research and development projects relevant to the source of funds. That is a good thing. The government committed in the commitment to regional Australia—and it is a shame that the government has not followed through on some of the other commitments to regional Australia—to reviewing the RDC model. Passage of these bills will implement changes arising from that very review.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The government conspired with the Productivity Commission to cut R&amp;D funding, and shame on it for that, but industry and the coalition shamed them out of it. That was necessary. In an effort to regain credibility on R&amp;D—and nothing is more important than R&amp;D, particularly in the farming sector—the minister put out a policy statement in relation to research and development, and now these changes to legislation are an effort to show that Labor is coming to the party in this particular area. We could say, 'Too little, too late,' but we have two days of parliament to go. Finally, even though it has rushed it through and even though there has not been consultation, the government is doing it.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Given the short time frame, the lack of consultation is a major issue. It is a significant issue. Industry has had no time to review legislation. A lot of the legislation that industry is often tackling here is complicated and complex, and industry needs to talk to its grassroots stakeholders to see how it will affect them. Often, the devil is in the detail; it is something that is forgotten on that side of the parliament. We heard the Senate bells going crazy last night and again today as upper house members scurried about trying to get through the dozens upon dozens of bits of legislation that this government is rushing through at—symbolically—five minutes to midnight in these last few days of parliament. It is not good enough. The public deserves better. Industry has had no time to review the legislation and, like the coalition, it has not seen it before its introduction last week. That is simply not good enough.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">However, we have spoken to a large number of stakeholders. As you would expect from the coalition, we consult with people. We care about people and we care about those affected. Their feedback—and you might be surprised to know this—has been relatively positive, with no substantive concerns raised. The changes appear positive, as they allow RDCs to undertake marketing at the request of industry, and that was an industry request. It enables the government of the day, by providing matching funding for voluntary contributions to all RDCs, to encourage the private sector to invest in rural R&amp;D. It removes the requirement for statutory RDCs to submit their annual operating plans to the minister of the day for his or her sign-off. It makes statutory RDC board selection processes more streamlined, and that is a good thing. It introduces funding arrangements for statutory RDCs to drive performance improvements, something we might see on the other side eventually. Performance improvements—that would be good. It increases transparency in the delivery of R&amp;D services and allows individual fisheries industry levies to be collected and matched, subject to a cap based on the gross value of production of that industry. It removes product-specific charge and levy rates.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The coalition has consulted with a number of stakeholders, including the National Farmers' Federation, that important, august body. I had the Chief Executive Officer of the NFF, Matt Linnegar, in my office yesterday and he is hopeful for better things to come. He is hopeful for an improved relationship between the government of the day and the primary industry sector because he obviously knows—and coming from the Riverina he would well know—the benefit of good consultation between government and the agricultural sector. Having worked at Murrumbidgee Irrigation he has seen how the water rights debate did not go as well as it ought.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">There are many farmers in my area who are hoping to see better legislation. They are looking very much forward to buyback being capped at 1,500 gigalitres so that farmers can get on with the job they have been doing in the Riverina for 100 years; that is, growing the food to feed our nation. I know that water is important for South Australia, even in regional areas such as Kapunda, in the member for Wakefield's electorate. I know that water is important for South Australia, but it is also important to be able to utilise that water as it flows down the Murray-Darling and Murrumbidgee systems to enable the farmers to get on with the job that they have been doing and that they were asked to do by government 100 years ago.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">They are getting on with the job. SunRice is certainly getting on with the job, having reopened its mills at Deniliquin and Coleambally, and with all the rain we have had in recent weeks we are very much looking forward to a great grain harvest. We certainly hope that the profits of that grain harvest will stay right here in Australia and that they will not be going overseas to be decided by a boardroom in Illinois. I ask that the Treasurer reject the ADM takeover of GrainCorp out of hand because it is un-Australian, it is not necessary and we need to keep the future of Australia's grain harvests in Australian hands. That is so very important.</span>

I would like to thank the members for Calare, Murray and Lyons, in particular, for their comments. Also, I cannot let my friend from the Riverina leave the chamber without making a few remarks on the comments that he made.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">First and foremost, contrary to the templated sheet that was handed out to those opposite, consultation on not only these amendments but also the intent and most of the content of the bill was carried out over a three-year period and very much formed the content of the 2012 research and development policy statement of this government. I hope the member for Riverina—who is, I must say, a very diligent member—has read that policy statement, because he, like me, in terms of primary industries and rural and regional development, believes that good ideas should be shared and, if they are very good, they should be followed. Prior to the exposure draft going out it was offered to some 72 relevant stakeholders, and only seven of them replied and even the majority of those were highly positive. The member for Riverina—who I know gets around his constituency and his agencies—was able to report a positive response to these amendments, and do you know why? It is because they have been part of the consultation process since cocky was an egg. So, frankly, I think that was a bit of a red herring.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I would leave you with one thought before we go on to the amendments themselves. This government created a ministry for Regional Development Australia and has done more for regional and rural Australia in the last three years in particular in terms of infrastructure and recognition than the other side did over decades. I think the Nationals member representing the Riverina is a little bit envious of what we have been able to do in that time, and I think it is only fair to due give recognition to that.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Anyway, let us move on to the amendments. The Rural Research and Development Legislation Amendment Bill 2013 updates and refines the Australian Research and Development Corporation, or RDC, model in line with policy commitments made by the government in the Rural Research and Development Policy Statement some years ago. In preparing the policy statement the government met and consulted with stakeholders around Australia and took into account many submissions. Extensive consultation continued in the process leading to these legislative amendments before us.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The bill will allow statutory RDCs to carry out marketing activities on behalf of their industries if a marketing levy is in place. RDCs undertaking marketing will be able to use their industry expertise to provide cost-effective, targeted marketing activities in accordance with industry needs and priorities. I would like to note that no changes to levy rates or new levies are part of these amendments. The amendments will encourage private sector investment in rural R&amp;D by extending to all RDCs the arrangements for government matching funding to voluntary contributions for eligible research and development.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Statutory funding agreements for statutory RDCs are proposed to drive performance improvements and increase transparency in the delivery of R&amp;D services. Funding agreements have been a flexible mechanism for providing government guidance and oversight to industry owned RDCs, and these amendments will extend that mechanism to statutory RDCs. Amendments in the bill change the process for selection of statutory RDC board directors to improve transparency and efficiency. The amendments promote due consideration of diversity in the selection process. These amendments aim to ensure high-quality boards for RDCs and reduce the time and delay associated with securing them.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The bill proposes to allow the collection and matching of individual fishery industry levies, subject to a cap based on the gross value of production of that individual fishery. This will allow specific fisheries to propose levies to invest in R&amp;D for their industry and to undertake marketing in a similar way to other rural commodities. The burdensome requirement for ministerial approval of statutory RDCs' annual operating plans will be removed and other minor technical matters will be addressed.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The Primary Industries (Excise) Levies Amendment Bill 2013 removes the maximum levy rates for research and development and marketing levies on primary industry products. Similarly, the Primary Industries (Customs) Charges Amendment Bill removes the maximum charge rates for R&amp;D and marketing changes that are duties of Customs. The numerical maximum levy and charge rates will be removed, and the rates will be limited to no more than the level recommended by an industry body following consultation with the levy and charge payers. The amendments will not change any levy or charge rates that are in operation at the moment, but they will streamline the process for changing rates in the future. Levies and charges may be increased following a request by industry, but will not be allowed to be set above the rate recommended by industry. This will allow industries to manage their collective investment in research and marketing whilst also providing a safeguard for levy payers against an arbitrary increase to rates.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Finally, I would like to thank the ministerial staff, the DAFF departmental officers and the drafters of the bill for their work and I also want to thank all those who contributed to the consultation process. I recommend this legislation to the House.</span>

                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Wakefield</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">12:01</span>):  It is my great pleasure to speak on the Migration Amendment (Temporary Sponsored Visas) Bill 2013. It has been a long and exhaustive debate—I did not think I would get a chance to speak because there were so many speakers before me. Of course one of those was the member for Canning who made some headlines when he accused the government of racism. I found that comment to be intemperate and obviously offensive but it also does not match my party's history. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">My party and, in particular, Arthur Calwell, as the first immigration minister, gave this country the postwar migration scheme. Indeed, Calwell was the father of that scheme and he very famously made a ministerial statement to this House saying that we would have 22 million Australians by 2020. He brought millions to this country who settled and brought their skills, their innovation and their energy from a destroyed postwar Europe. They built the Snowy Mountains scheme, many of the railways and most of the postwar infrastructure that was put in place by the Curtin and Chifley governments—continued in large part by the Menzies government, no doubt about that.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Migration was a fundamental part of that postwar reconstruction, as it was called. If you look on Google and type in 'Arthur Calwell', a very old video will come up—it is a video now but it would have been a film back then—of Arthur Calwell saying, 'Give me the ships and I will bring the right type of people to this country.'</span>

                      <span class="HPS-MemberContinuation">Mr CHAMPION:</span>
                    </a>  The member for Berowra should take it easy; he has a habit of interjecting. My party are the architects of postwar migration, and Arthur Calwell can rightly be seen as the architect of multicultural Australia. So much of his legacy has been diminished by people who want to simply reel off his responses as interjections in this place as some sort of evidence of racism when, in actual fact, he was, as I said before, the father of the postwar migration scheme, the father of multicultural Australia. At the heart of that scheme was that people would come here, have permanent residence, become citizens, work and bring their skills, their innovation, their ideas and their families to this country and make a permanent contribution to it</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The 457 scheme does not do that. The 457 scheme is a guest worker program—that is what it is; that is what it has always been. I am not a fan of the scheme; I do not like it. I think in so many ways it does not do this country a service. The great trick of the conservatives has been to equate what is a guest worker scheme with skilled migration when the two things are quite different. The two things are different in this respect: your visa under 457 is linked to your job; lose your job, lose your visa. That is the way it works—lose your job and you have got 28 days to leave the country. That is how it works and that was implicit in its design in the Howard years. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The second thing I do not like about the 457 scheme is that much of the money that is earned here, much of the income, is remitted. It does not stay in this country; it is remitted to many countries abroad. Those remittances are good for these countries—there is no doubt about that. Many countries around the world rely on remittances, but it is not good for Australia to have the earnings of these people remitted to other countries. It does not stay in the country.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The last thing is the skills are also sent home. At least half of the people return after their visas have concluded and they take their skills, their innovation and what they have learnt with them. The other half stay. Why not have them stay in the beginning? Why not give them the security of permanent residence in the beginning? If they are good citizens, why not keep them?</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">As long as a person's visa is linked to their job, they will be forever vulnerable. That is the truth of the matter. Anybody who has ever been at a work site understands that implicitly. It is not surprising employers think these workers are great workers. They are great workers because they have to be, they do not have a choice. If your job is linked to your visa and you have a family that is reliant on your remittances, then you are in a vulnerable position. And if the boss says, 'Jump,' you will jump. If you talk to people who have had experience with these visas you will find employers are glowing in their appreciation of it—no doubt about that. But if you talk to the workers who work alongside them, there is often a great deal of sympathy for people on 457s, because they do not have that opportunity to raise an objection. They live with that fear, with that idea, that if they speak up, if they say anything to their boss, they could lose their job and thus lose their visa. I think that is at the very heart of what is a guest worker program.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We get a lot of rhetoric from the opposition about skills, and about how employers need these skills. But this scheme, the 457 scheme, does not serve the country in the long term. It serves it in the short term. It gives you a short-term solution to a skills problem. We all know there is a skills problem in this country. The fact that we cannot find enough doctors and nurses for our hospitals is a disgrace. The fact we cannot find enough diesel mechanics is a disgrace. But a 457 program, a guest workers scheme running indefinitely, just makes employers lazy. It does not give them any incentive to invest in skills. It does not give them any inducement to invest in skills if they know that they can just get another diesel mechanic—once one visa has concluded, they can just get another worker on another visa—and it makes them lazy about planning for the skills they need in the long term.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The 457 visa scheme provides no incentive for employers to drag people into the labour market who are currently outside of it, such as mature age workers and young workers. In my electorate, there would not be a week goes by that I do not meet a mature age worker who wants to work and cannot get a start, cannot get a job—and it is not for want of trying. The same could be said for young people as well. Often they cannot find a start, or they get the wrong start. This program, the 457 program, in the long term is lazy and it is counterproductive and it does not encourage skills formation. All of the skills that are brought to this country, or at least half of them, evaporate; they leave the country with the workers.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">In my electorate I often see the by-product of what I call fast-food traineeships. People on both sides of parliament have got up in this House and talked about the extraordinary number of traineeships and the like, contracts of training, that have been occurring over the past 15 years or so, but so many of these traineeships come out of fast-food businesses. I see young people all the time signed up on a contract of service for a low training wage, and I think they get questionable benefits out of this in some sectors. Some of the traineeships are very good, but some of them are of very poor quality. It really saddens me that when I go to the trades school in my electorate—St Patrick's trade school—I hear of young people who want to sign up for an apprenticeship, but at some time in the past they have gone to a fast-food establishment and signed up to a training contract—and, of course, you only get one training contract. In effect they are denied a trade because at some point in the past they signed up, often without thinking about it too much, to a traineeship in fast food or in retail or in hospitality. There is a definite problem with the quality of some of these traineeships. That is another area that we have to look at. We have to make sure the money the government puts in for skills training actually gets used for training in the skills where we have real shortages: diesel mechanics, doctors and nurses, and all of the classifications on the list for 457 visas.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">In summarising my views, I think the 457 scheme should not be confused with skilled migration, and it is certainly not a long-term solution; it is a bandaid. And if those opposite think they can fix our skills problem by making this scheme even easier to utilise for employers, all the while engaging in dark partisanship on a whole range of other migration matters, they have another think coming. If they think they can lower the standards of this guest worker scheme and make it easier for employers to bring foreigners to this country to work and that the Australian public will just stand by and give a bit of a golfers clap to that, they have another think coming. They must have rocks in their heads, particularly when, as I said before, so many Australians are looking for work and cannot find it.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">As I said before, the details of this bill are not all that I would want them to be. I would want a much stronger response to the 457 program, and I have expressed that view in my party room. But this bill does have a lot of merit. The first one is that it requires employers to undertake labour market testing. Labour market testing is as simple as advertising for a job to see if you can find any Australians before you bring in someone from overseas to take a job. It does not seem like that much of an onerous requirement to me to advertise, to see if you can find an Australian to take the job. It does not seem difficult. In fact, I think most Australians would think that is a fair thing to do. This bill gives the minister some mechanisms to make sure the sponsorship obligations can be enforced and that they are actually undertaken by employers. That is done through enforceable undertakings and making sure that employers actually meet the training requirements and the like of having these visas.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Most importantly, it allows the Fair Work Ombudsman to monitor and investigate compliance and sponsorship obligations, and that takes the number of inspectors from about 30 to about 300. One of the big problems with this program at the moment is that the good employers who follow the rules and do the right thing get a pat on the back, but the employers who do not do the right thing get away with it because there is inadequate inspection. This bill provides inspectors. I would have thought that that is a pretty basic requirement: that if you are going to have a program you make sure there is compliance in it—a pretty standard thing, I would have thought.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The bill provides—and I think this is terribly important—the visa holder with additional time to find a job if they lose their job. It amends the Migration Regulations 1994 to extend the period from 28 days to 90 consecutive days for visa holders who lose their job and want to look for another one.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This bill is a pretty moderate attempt at cleaning up a program which I think has serious deficiencies, which in the long term does not serve the country's interests. As I said before, I would prefer to see the back of this scheme. If people are going to migrate to this country, I would prefer to see them come here as permanent residents, that they bring their families, that they settle and that we keep the skills and innovation and their entrepreneurialism in this country.</span>

                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">
                    <a href="M3C" type="MemberSpeech">
                      <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Mr BANDT</span>
                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Melbourne</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">12:16</span>):  To speak to some of the principles behind this bill, the Greens have argued for a long time that in this country we need to share the benefits of what may well be a once-in-a-generation mining boom fairly. We have argued that in respect of the mining tax. We have ended up with a mining tax where, if it is spreading the benefits of a boom, I reckon it is spread so thinly that most people really cannot taste it because, up until recently, we have had a situation this year where the mining tax has brought in less revenue than the government was taking from single parents by cutting their payments. We have consistently argued for a proper mining tax, for one that would allow us to fund education and health and to set Australia up for the future.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We have also argued that with respect to the jobs that flow from the mining boom in particular. We are in a situation where the owners of all our mineral wealth—the Australian people—are not getting a fair return. When we have a situation where 83 per cent of the profits are going overseas, as is the case at the moment, there is an argument for fixing that. But, more so, the jobs that have been generated from the minerals that all Australians own should also ensure a proper return to our country. That means opportunities for people to work and it also means making sure that we use some of the money for training the next generation so that we do not just have people come and work and share the benefits of the wealth and then leave. We do not want to wake up when the mining boom is over to find that all the skills have gone with it. That has been the real risk of the government's 457 program. Over a number of years I have certainly heard many stories of that program having been abused—of people coming in as 'project managers' without any requisite qualification and essentially being put to work doing any task. That obviously affects local workers, because local workers are being undercut.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">If you bring someone in from overseas, they are probably less likely than an Australian worker to know how to enforce their rights in the Australian legal system and they are probably less likely to know what they are entitled to. That affects the local workers, but it also affects the workers who have come in on 457s. They have been open to significant exploitation. We have seen significant reports of that, and that is, in part, the reason the Greens have been pushing for the government to ratify the international convention on the rights of migrant workers, because abuse of this scheme hurts everyone. It hurts the people that come over here who can find themselves essentially in a form of indebted slavery and it hurts the people who do not get jobs because they are being undercut.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We have been arguing for some time that, up until the introduction of this bill, we were getting the worst of both worlds. We were getting rhetoric that verged on xenophobic, without any meaningful action. The Greens argue that we need to dial down the rhetoric, but turn up the meaningful protections for local employment. So I am pleased that the principle we have been advocating for some time, which is advertising first, has been adopted and is recognised in this bill.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">One concern that we have expressed is that the protections in this bill seem to stop at workers who require degree qualifications or other similar qualifications. When there are reports in areas like nursing and engineering, where we are coming off the back of a downturn in mining and with manufacturing also under pressure, those people ought to be entitled to exactly the same protection. That is something we have advocated for strongly.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I also want to put on the record that this is not a situation where we are advocating that there should be no-one or only a limited number of people from overseas coming here to work. Having people from overseas coming and working in Australia on temporary or long-term arrangements is unquestionably a good thing. In some areas—for example, education and science—we should make sure that we remain open to people with significant expertise coming and spending time in this country. It is good for them and it is good for us.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">There is also a good argument that when people are legitimately here on holiday or other arrangements they are entitled to perform some kind of work while they are here, provided that that does not turn into a backdoor way of abusing the system. Provided that it does not, it benefits those people and it benefits us. Some people are lucky enough ultimately to translate their work here on a temporary visa into citizenship, and I have met many of those people, including in my electorate of Melbourne. But at the end of the day our primary responsibility as the Australian parliament should be to ensure that we look after the Australian people. If that means standing up to big business and saying, 'No, you can't get away with whatever you want; you need to spread some of the benefits of this boom and of operating a successful company in Australia to local workers,' then we should insist on that.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Aside from those issues of areas where the bill ought to be improved, as I have been advocating for some time, I am pleased that this bill was brought before the parliament and that we will have an opportunity to pass it before parliament rises.</span>

                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">
                    <a href="00AN3" type="MemberSpeech">
                      <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Mr BRENDAN O'CONNOR</span>
                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Gorton</span>—<span class="HPS-MinisterialTitles">Minister for Immigration and Citizenship</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">12:23</span>):  I thank the members for their contribution to the second reading debate on this bill. I remind the House that the Migration Amendment (Temporary Sponsored Visas) Bill 2013 amends the Migration Act to reinforce the importance of overseas skilled workers to the Australian economy while ensuring there are employment and training opportunities for Australian citizens and permanent residents.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This bill will require employers to first look to the Australian labour market before seeking to sponsor workers from overseas by requiring 457 visa sponsors to undertake labour market testing in a manner consistent with Australia's international trade obligations. This will ensure that the subclass 457 visa program is used only to address genuine skills shortages when local labour is unavailable. In my second reading speech I indicated that the time frame for undertaking labour market testing would be within six months; however, after further consideration, I have proposed that four months would be a more appropriate time frame. Six months may be too long a period in a dynamic labour market where conditions can change rapidly.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The bill also builds upon the sponsorship framework introduced in 2009 as a result of the worker protection act. It will enshrine in the Migration Act the kinds of sponsorship obligations to be prescribed in the migration regulations. The bill will also build on the current enforcement regime by expanding the suite of options available to the department to take action against sponsors who are found not to be meeting their obligations. In addition to the civil penalty provisions introduced in 2009 and the administrative sanctions to bar a sponsor or cancel the approval of a person as a sponsor, the minister may now also consider enforceable undertakings. This will be an important tool to encourage sponsor compliance.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The bill further builds on the capacity of the government to monitor and investigate compliance with the temporary work sponsored visa program by expanding inspector powers to the Fair Work Ombudsman. The bill will also deliver a more socially just outcome for visa holders by extending the time that they can seek another sponsor or arrange their affairs to leave Australia from 28 to 90 days.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I turn now to some of the points that were raised in the debate on the bill. Members of the opposition have suggested there is not sufficient evidence to warrant changes to the current arrangements. I would refute that. The 457 scheme is intended to fill job vacancies where there are skills shortages. There is extensive empirical and anecdotal evidence suggesting that the 457 program is not being used for that purpose. Departmental records of 457 breaches underestimate the problem because there are 32 inspectors to investigate, monitor and enforce breaches of 108,810 457 visas. Over the past three years, visits, sanctions and warnings fell by 80, 60 and 40 per cent respectively. Question 7 of the survey published by the Migration Council asked, 'Do you find it difficult to hire workers from the local labour market?' If they asked, they were told 'local' meant Australia. There were three options: 'yes, very', 'yes, somewhat' and 'no'. Fifteen per cent answered no. Fifteen per cent of employers would have had no difficulty in hiring locally but did not.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">As at 30 April, there were 108,810 457 visa holders. That represents a 20.4 per cent growth over the previous year. For the whole economy, employment is growing at around one per cent per annum. There was once a close correlation between the job vacancies for the whole economy and the 457 applications. These used to track closely together. Since May 2011, vacancies have declined or remained static while 457 application rates have continued to trend upwards.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Consider the pattern of 457 nominations and job vacancy advertisements in the past 12 months for the most common occupations for 457 visas. Cafe manager nominations are up 189 per cent and ads are down three per cent. For chefs nominations are up 33 per cent and ads are down six per cent. For call centre managers nominations are up 226 per cent and ads are down 14 per cent. For information technology nominations are up seven per cent and ads are down 24 per cent. For accountants nominations are up 21 per cent and ads are down 16 per cent. The Department of Education, Employment and Workplace Relations's own rating for the occupation of accountants suggests there is no shortage. For accommodation and food services there has been a 101 per cent increase in primary applications lodged in this industry in the year to 30 April at a time when vacancies for cooks have been falling. Cook is currently the top sponsored occupation for 457 visas.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Consider these two facts for New South Wales. To 30 March this year, 730 primary applications were lodged for cooks in New South Wales. This is a 99 per cent increase on the same period in the previous program year. Over the same period apprenticeship commencements in commercial cookery were down 12 per cent in New South Wales compared to the same period in the last financial year. Over the past four years in retail aggregate employment has decreased by a bit more than one per cent; but, compared to just one year ago, applications for 457s for retail have increased by 69 per cent.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">During debate, again and again the opposition said that labour market testing would present an additional burden upon business in Australia. The government rejects this as most businesses already advertise vacancies to seek to recruit Australian citizens and permanent residents. This bill simply seeks to ensure that those employers who do not do the right thing will first look to recruit locally.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The opposition has also persisted with what I believe is a contemptible debate which suggests that the government is seeking to demonise foreign workers. Far from the government endangering social cohesion, the opposition has fuelled a debate based on false notions. The government has always said and will continue to say that the subclass 457 program is a valuable supplement to the domestic labour pool when used appropriately. For the opposition to generate ill will in this way is, quite frankly, absurd and I take personal offence at it. The opposition has also suggested that the absence of the regulatory impact statement was an issue notwithstanding the fact that the majority of elements in this bill did not require a regulatory impact statement, as advised by the Office of Best Practice Regulation. While I agree that an impact statement is desirable, in this case the impact upon business because of the labour market testing element, which is the only element requiring an RAS, will be minor while the outcome for Australians seeking employment and for visa holders requiring protections will be improved. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The opposition said there is insufficient consultation. I have consulted with my ministerial colleagues, the Ministerial Advisory Council on Skilled Migration, and my department has consulted with relevant Commonwealth agencies throughout the development of this bill. Consultations will be ongoing as the measures in this bill are implemented. The opposition has said that the existing legislative framework provides sufficient options to take action against sponsors who do the wrong thing. By tightening the sponsoring obligations and by enhancing the penalty framework by including enforceable undertakings, the integrity of the subclass 457 will be improved. This can only benefit Australians searching for work and protect vulnerable visa holders from unscrupulous employers.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I refer to the member for Lyne, who I have always felt has engaged on matters genuinely. I respectfully disagree, however, with his remarks that it is all about resources and enforcing the current provisions. The advice I have received is that we cannot enforce some of the provisions, that the undertakings are not enforceable. Insofar as the resources are concerned, as I have indicated, we have announced a very significant increase by the use of the Fair Work inspectorate officers.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I also refer specifically to the contribution from the member for Canning. I found that inflammatory and insulting insofar as he attempts to attack my motives, particularly in relation to believing that in any way I would act in a manner that was discriminatory against anybody of a particular race. I found it highly offensive. I also found it somewhat odd because he was chair of a parliamentary inquiry that recommended in 2007 that there be a trial for labour market testing when he was still a chair and when the Howard government was still in government. He did suggest only a trial and he did focus on a limited number of occupations, but in fact on that occasion there were 58,000 visa applicants. Yet, as someone who got up only a few days ago to challenge the motives and the cogency of our argument, he himself was chair of a committee that had recommended a trial for labour market testing.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Finally, I would like to thank all of those who I have not referred to who have contributed. This is a very important debate in this place. I understand why there would be different views but I think that these improvements are important. The bill acknowledges the benefits of the temporary sponsored skilled migration program while recalibrating the legislative settings to ensure that the intent of the program—namely to temporarily fill genuine skilled vacancies—is achieved in practice. I commend the bill to the House.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The amendments to the bill are in relation to the requirement for sponsors to undertake labour market testing prior to lodging an application for nomination approval. In the bill as it currently stands, the labour market testing requirement is met if the minister is satisfied that a suitably qualified Australian citizen or an Australian permanent resident is not readily available to fill the position. It is proposed to extend this to include eligible temporary visa workers on a work-and-holiday 462 visa or a working holiday 417 visa in the agriculture sector who are lawfully employed by the sponsor or an associated entity of the sponsor at the time of the application for nomination. The labour market testing requirement will now be satisfied if a suitably qualified and experienced Australian citizen, Australian permanent resident or eligible temporary visa holder is not readily available to fill the nominated position.</span>

                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">In relation to the evidentiary requirements for sponsors, I propose that it be mandatory for a sponsor to provide information about their attempts to recruit suitably qualified and experienced Australian citizens or Australian permanent residents to the position and any similar positions. Sponsors must also provide details of any advertising, paid or unpaid, of the position and any similar positions commissioned or authorised by the approved sponsor and fee and other expenses paid or payable for that advertising. In the bill as it currently stands, the provision of information about recruitment attempts is only one of several evidentiary options that sponsors may choose to provide as proof that they have adequately tested the local labour market prior to lodging a nomination. Requiring the mandatory provision of such information provides a much stronger test of a sponsor's efforts to fill vacancies in their business with Australian workers.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This amendment also clarifies that, if the approved sponsor elects to provide evidence and information other than evidence of advertising and fees or payment of fees to support their claims to have tested the labour market, the minister may take the evidence into account. The nomination will not, however, be treated less favourably if the approved sponsor elects not to provide such additional evidence or information. In addition, I propose a mandatory requirement for sponsors to provide information if one or more Australian citizens or permanent residents were made redundant or retrenched from positions in the nominated occupation in the sponsor's business or associated entity in the four months prior to the lodging of a nomination. If there have been redundancies or retrenchments, labour market testing must be undertaken by the sponsor after those redundancies and retrenchments.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The bill currently allows for skill and occupational exemptions to the labour market testing requirement to apply to specific occupations by legislative instrument within skills level 1 or 2 as currently described in the Australian and New Zealand Standard Classification of Occupations. I now intend to restrict the skill and occupational exemptions in relation to labour market testing, with the effect that nominations made by the approved sponsors requiring either experience or a qualification or both in engineering, including shipping engineering, or nursing cannot be exempt from labour market testing. This will be applied in a manner consistent with Australia's international trade obligations. Furthermore, in line with the reduction in the period over which a sponsor will be required to test the local labour market from six to four months, I propose a consequential amendment to the evidence requirement for labour market testing in relation to research on the labour market trends generally, and in relation to relevant occupations I propose to reduce the period in which this research would be released from six to four months prior to a sponsor lodging a nomination.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Lastly, to ensure that the views of the relevant stakeholders are considered in any regulatory changes to the subclass 457 visa program and in recognition of the advisory function of the Ministerial Advisory Council on Skilled Migration, I propose the inclusion of the requirement that the minister must take all reasonable steps to ensure that at all times there is in existence the Ministerial Advisory Council on Skilled Migration—a body which includes representatives of unions, industry, state and territory governments and other members, if any, nominated by the minister—and that it meet at least on a quarterly basis. Without limiting the functions, the Ministerial Advisory Council on Skilled Migration is to provide advice to the minister in relation to the temporary sponsored work visa program. I commend the proposed amendments to the House.</span>

                    <a href="E3L" type="MemberSpeech">
                      <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Mr MORRISON</span>
                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Cook</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">13:01</span>):  These amendments are fundamentally driven by the member for New England in the discussions he has had with the government over these matters. When we had those discussions with the member for New England, they were about reducing the regulatory burden. The government has put forward an amendment here which increases the regulatory burden, and this is to a bill and a set of measures that were already designed to choke the 457 scheme. We heard the last speaker for the government speak on this bill, and I think he was quite honest about the government's real intentions here. He wants to see the 457 scheme completely abolished and abandoned. There are two ways to do that: you can abolish the scheme or you can choke it to death through the measures this government is introducing through this bill in its attack on skilled migration.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">In this bill, and in this amendment in particular, the government seeks to legislate in the Ministerial Advisory Council on Skilled Migration, a council that does a good job. But one has to question why there is a need to actually mandate its presence in the legislation, other than when you get into the amendment and you note that the government is mandating the presence of unions in the formation of that council and, by law, hard-wiring the union into the process into the future. This is something we have seen from this government now for some time in the dying days of this 43rd Parliament as they do the bidding of the unions, even here in this last amendment they are seeking to put forward in this bill.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The amendments also make one worthy suggestion, though, and that deals with the transfer arrangements for those on skilled temporary visas or other temporary visas where they might translate. Why would the government seek to put this all in one omnibus group of amendments and not deal with that separately? If it had dealt with it separately then the coalition might have had the opportunity to support that matter. But, because it is bundled up here with the increased regulation the government has put on the table courtesy of the member for New England, we find ourselves in a situation where this is not an amendment we can support.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">There are more mandatory obligations presented in the amendments put forward by the government than they had in their first bill. The red union tape only chokes this measure and chokes this scheme all the more tightly as a result of what the minister has brought in and put on this table today. I believe he has the purpose of trying to see this scheme run into the ground and taken out of the vital role that it plays in our economy. At the behest of the unions he would see this scheme go by the wayside, despite the fact that there are already significant powers and protections that were introduced into these measures back in 2008 as a result of the Deegan review. That gave powers to the government to go out there and police these measures.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We have seen that, despite a 20 per cent increase in the number of active sponsors, the number of sponsors monitored by the government has fallen by 67 per cent and the number of sponsor sites visited has fallen by 51 per cent. The budget for detection onshore of visa compliance has fallen from $74 million to $52 million under this government. So a government that says it wants to crack down on abuses has not given it the budget and has not increased its level of inspection despite the increased powers it was given. That is why the member for Lyne made very good points, in the debate earlier on the second reading, about powers that existed and the lack of any need, based on the lack of substantiation put forward by the government in bringing these measures to this House, to go forward and actually go and police the laws that it currently has. Our argument has been simple. The government has not done the appropriate work to bring this measure into the parliament and now it is seeking to add insult to injury through these amendments by applying further red tape to this measure, courtesy of the member for New England's support for this bill.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I note also that the minister notes that there are special restrictions applied for those in nursing and engineering. I note his comment about international trade issues and I would welcome the minister tabling what those international trade issues are, but I would make this point. We know that 457s are used as a critical measure to get nurses into regional and rural areas of Australia. It is a very important part of this scheme. The minister has not explained why he is seeking to make it harder to get nurses into rural and regional areas or to get engineers into major construction projects or major resource projects, which is a critical need, nor has he tabled the details of why he would add an additional burden on industry and on the health system to get the people it needs to provide the care and support workers required. <span style="font-style:italic;">(Time expired)</span></span>

                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Dickson</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">13:06</span>):  I want briefly to contribute to this debate because this is an incredibly important issue, particularly for regional areas that are in desperate need of trained nurses who otherwise cannot be found in the domestic market. If anybody wanted a demonstration of how this government puts its political masters ahead of the interests of the Australian people, they need look no further than what Minister O'Connor is providing for in this bill. This is an attack on the average worker and it is an attack on regional Australia. The fact is that this government is fully owned and operated by the union movement in this country, and this bill proves that beyond any doubt whatsoever. It is very difficult indeed for regional hospitals to attract the nursing skills that they need. It is very hard to attract the clinical services that specialist nursing staff require and in many cases need to be brought in under a 457 visa. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">It is the case that this government promised to fix public hospitals. They promised that they would fix public hospitals by mid-2009 or seek at a subsequent election to take financial control of those 750 public hospitals. They said that as a government they had a plan for hospitals in this nation. They wanted to make it easier for people to see a doctor or nurse in a regional hospital. But, by their very action today, they show that they were at very best misleading in that claim after the 2007 election. </span>

                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This is a government that has been filled with promises that have been broken on a daily basis. This is a government that has put the interests of union bosses ahead of Australian patients. This bill today demonstrates that again. This government, in its dying days, has demonstrated to the public yet again that it cannot be trusted. It has demonstrated to the Australian public, particularly those who live in regional areas where they find it incredibly difficult to get not just nursing staff but doctors and specialists, that this is a problem of the government's own making. This is a government that makes it harder for Australians, not easier. This is a government that makes it harder for Australia's public hospitals to operate, not easier. That is why this government should be condemned in relation to this bill. </span>

                    </a>  If it assists the House, I withdraw. But it is a matter of public record that this minister's links to the union movement have spanned decades, and it is now Australian patients, doctors, nurses and those running public hospitals in regional areas who are going to suffer because of those very links. This minister is motivated not by patients or by helping out regional hospitals but by pleasing union bosses. That is why this government, in the public's eye, is done. The deals that this government has presided over with the union movement, with its bosses, condemns it to failure at the next election. That is why this parliament should oppose a particularly bad piece of legislation.</span>

As the House would be aware, I had circulated a previous set of amendments I referred to in my second reading speech. The Greens were always concerned to make sure that the protections in this bill extended across the board. There are particular areas of concern to us, and those are for people in higher skilled and degree qualified occupations. These are nurses, people working in IT, engineers—particularly engineers who are working in mobile areas, like ships or planes—who are in areas that I have been made aware of as having many instances of abuse and concern.</span>

This is one of the largest groups which use 457 visas, with 12,580 subclass 457 visas as at 30 April 2013.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This has been a very important area for Australia. There is a specific carve-out for nurses in this area, where nurses often have a relevant bachelor's degree. When you look at our skilled migration program, Australia has been admired around the world for the robustness of our skilled migration program. When you travel to other countries, they know that we have a rigorous assessment. We have details of quantifications where there are shortages. How important this has been to our economy should not be underestimated.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">One of the things that the Howard government did when it was elected in 1996 was to get the balance right between skilled migration and family reunion. Under the previous government, there had been too much of a focus on family reunion and not enough on the skilled migration program. When you look at the ways our economy can grow, there are basically three sources. Growth comes either from population growth, from participation or from productivity. Those are the only three ways we can see our economy grow. </span>

It has been very important in addressing the constraints to growth. We now see the Labor Party responding to their union bosses and a campaign which has been run and dictated by the unions to try to remove a very important source of economic growth, particularly in areas where people are finding it hard—where hospitals, health services and aged care are finding it hard to attract nurses under 457 visas. This is one of the problems that the opposition has with this bill.</span>

                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Kennedy</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">13:14</span>):  I have great respect for the member for Dickson. I think he has showed a lot of moral courage and intelligence on a number of occasions, but I have to disagree with him and the previous speaker on this issue on the Migration Amendment (Temporary Sponsored Visas) Bill 2013. I have had to live with it all of my life, trying to get nurses and doctors into rural Australia, and we now have eight new universities turning out doctors, with about 12 or 15 turning out nurses. The cavalry is on the way.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">But what is happening is that we are getting people from overseas. In Queensland we had the dreadful case of Dr Death at Bundaberg, but there are many other cases similar to that. With a lot of the people coming in it is very difficult for the migration services, and I think the health services have been a little lax in allowing people in who are not qualified like our Australian doctors. We would like to think our medical training in Australia is superior to the rest of the world in the area of medical technology. It is one of the very few areas in which Australia is still holding its ground against the rest of the world. We would like to think we are very advanced in these areas. If we are, then rural Australia is getting the rough end of the pineapple; we are not getting as good a product as is coming out of our Australian universities.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">But as always we are acting like we need 457 visas. We had never had 457 visas in our history until about 15 years ago. It is rather intriguing that the Liberals are advocating the 457 visas when they allowed only 38,000 in—God bless them—whereas the current mob are allowing 100,000 in. If we judge political parties on their performances then I would be giving an A to the Liberal Party and a Z to the Labor Party on this issue. I find the few points being put forward today rather ironic. I choose the word 'ironic', but there is obviously another word in my mind. Why, suddenly, in the last 15 years have we not had any nurses, any fitters, any miners? Mr Deputy Speaker, please do not insult our intelligence! At Boggabri there were 100 people from overseas, from one of the cheapest labour countries in the world. They decided they needed cutbacks, so there were 100 of them brought in and put there. Then they sacked all of the Australian workers. They are insulting our intelligence. This is about undermining pay and conditions.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The Leader of the Nationals was so stupid yesterday as to let the cat out of the bag, which we will make sure the people of Queensland and of other places know, when he said that the real problem here is that the base issues are the wages. Thank you, you have just said it all. The real problem is the wages, and we have to get the wages down. He did not say that, but it was implied in what he said. He gave the wage figures from New Zealand, the United States and Australia. He said $8 an hour. The implication of what he was saying was clearly that we should be working here for $8 an hour. A person on the opposition benches made such a stupid statement, and she at least had the decency to apologise to the Australian people; I doubt we will getting that out of the Leader of the Nationals. No, what we are talking about here is undermining our pay and conditions, having a totally supine workforce where the boss holds the deportation order and can crack the whip of the deportation order any time he feels like it. It is to the eternal shame of the Labor Party, and it will be remembered in history as the party that brought in 125,000 foreign workers on top of the nearly 200,000 that are coming in under the migration program.</span>

In fact, the member for Kennedy, the member for New England, the member for Denison, the member for Dobell and the member for Melbourne have worked with the government on a range of these amendments. In fact, it was the member for New England who recommended the reference to temporary work visas, which was the one amendment that the member for Cook supported in his contribution. I am not sure why he is showing any particular enmity towards the member for New England's position in light of the fact that the one amendment that he did agree upon was suggested by the member for New England.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">In relation to international treaties, I have referred to that insofar as our bilateral arrangements that would confine labour market testing between certain countries. That is in the second reading speech. Insofar as the nursing exemptions go, there have been some concerns about graduates of nursing schools in Australia not getting opportunities to fill positions. All the while, certain employers are filling those positions with temporary skilled nurses. We need temporary skilled nurses in parts of the country—no doubt—and all that will be required is an advertisement. The same applies to engineering. We have had concerns about certain areas of engineering. Again, let us remember what is being asked here. There is no proscription on these occupations insofar as 457s are concerned; it is suggesting only that there should be an advertisement and that the local market be tested. I think that is entirely reasonable.</span>

We disagree on some of them, and I know he has some amendments to move shortly. I will say more about it then if I need to.</span>

The minister is singling out nurses and engineers to require them to be subject to labour market testing, whereas any other person with a bachelor degree or higher qualification or five years or more of relevant experience would not be subject to that. I just want to be very clear that the minister is not saying that that is because of any international treaties or trade arrangements.</span>

I would refer the honourable member to my second reading speech. What I also said and made very clear in my second reading speech is that, whilst we would look to consider occupations in level 1 to be exempt from market testing, that would be done by legislative instrument, in the main. What I have done in this instance is included two professions that I think require what is still a very low level form of testing. This is not an overly rigorous or onerous testing.</span>

That was clear from the beginning. It has been put to me by a number of other members—and I have also had evidence provided to me—that there are some concerns in relation to those particular very important professions. For that reason, they are expressly referred to in the legislation. But that would not prevent us from ensuring that other levels and other occupations would in fact require labour market testing if we chose to do that by legislative instrument beyond the enactment of this bill if it passes both houses.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The amendments put forward achieve one simple purpose—that is, to give effect to the minister's own statement and the member for New England's own expressed desire of amendments to this bill and the discussions that were held with the coalition.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The minister said at the Skilled Migration National Employer Conference in Melbourne on Friday, 21 June—and I have heard him make this same statement on numerous occasions in relation to these measures:</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">Labour market testing is putting an ad in the paper, that's it—there are no other undertakings required from the employer.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">As we know, that is plainly not true in the bill that was presented in this House in terms of the many other obligations that are put on employers in relation to the labour market testing that was introduced, found not to be effective, found not to be working and was abolished and replaced with the reference to the skilled occupation list. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">These amendments are to ensure that we can be true in this bill to what the minister has represented for this bill and that the amendments that have just been put forward by the government are indeed what the law actually says. What these amendments do is simply ensure that the act will say that labour market testing means advertising the position in the media in the manner prescribed by the regulations—nothing more, nothing less.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">What the coalition is suggesting here is that the labour market testing regime, which the government has forced onto this parliament, be restricted to only what the minister has said it is outside of this place and, indeed, inside this place—that is, it should only be to have an ad in the paper. So if the minister is true to his word, if the minister actually wants to reflect in the law what he has represented this bill to be outside of this place, then the government should support the amendments. The government should support ensuring that all that is required, to use his own words, is that labour market testing is putting an ad in the paper. That is it. There are no other undertakings required from the employer. That is what the amendments do. That is exactly what the amendments do.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">What the government has done is bring amendments in here with the support of Independents, who all sought to have even greater regulatory burdens put on as a result of this bill. But also what the minister has said outside of this place is to just bring it back to the simple requirement to have advertising placed in the manner and form prescribed by the regulations. Why would we require it to be done by regulation? Obviously there is a need to specify what form this would take. Technologies change, readership patterns change: is it local, is it national, is it on the internet, is it on Seek.com, is it in the local newspaper? All of these things would need to be addressed. They are properly addressed in the regulations, not in the substantive bill.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">What we have here is a con. We have the minister who we already know was caught out, when it came to his substantiation for this bill, making up the claim of 10,000—caught out. Now we have the minister caught out again in making representations outside of this place, and even inside of this place it would seem, suggesting that all the bill requires is an ad in the paper when it plainly requires far more red union tape than that. He has been caught out misrepresenting it again. And if the House wants further evidence of that, then in the one inquiry that has been undertaken into this bill, rushed through the Senate last week—the House inquiry that was to be undertaken on this matter before this parliament even considered it, was dodged by the government—Senator Cash asked the officials from the department of immigration:</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">… what Minister O'Connor stated. He stated, 'Labour market testing is putting an ad in the paper. That is it. There are no other undertakings required from the employer'—</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">quoting the minister, and she went on:</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">… upon what basis does Minister O'Connor make that statement?</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">That was the question to the official. And the answer was:</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">… I cannot speak to why the minister would have made that statement.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Once again, the Department of Immigration and Citizenship has left this minister hanging out to dry on another false claim that he has been making. Whether it is trying to make up the evidence for the bill that he has brought before the House or make up what this bill actually does, the minister has been caught out serially and seriously misleading what the true intentions and effect of this bill are. The government and the crossbenchers have the opportunity to make sure this bill only does what the minister has told the Australian people that it would do. It should just be an ad in the paper. That is what these amendments will require, and I call on members to support them.</span>

Dr Liu will be remembered as the father of Chinatown and one of the influential figures behind the development of multiculturalism in Brisbane and throughout Queensland. Sadly, Eddie passed away last night aged 91.</span>

Eddie will leave a lasting legacy in our community. He was a passionate advocate not only for the Chinese community but for the entire city of Brisbane. He will be sorely missed, particularly by his beloved Chinese Club of Queensland. I extend my sincere condolences to his family and friends. I know that you, Mr Deputy Speaker Scott, as the member for Maranoa, and the member for Brisbane, Teresa Gambaro, join with me in passing on our condolences.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Small">Extrajudicial killing, attack on peaceful demonstration and suppression of media is rampant. Thousands of general people, journalists and opposition activists are being tortured and jails hold three times more detainees than capacity.</span>

I met with representatives; I will not name them all, because they are actually concerned about their family members being tracked down by the government in Bangladesh. They showed me photographs. They told me horrible tales of death, destruction, detention and, in fact, massacres mentioned by Amnesty International.</span>

They have 28 stores across Australia, mostly in South Australia. They employ an incredible 2,400 employees. The Romeo family began the business on their own as a family of five or six. Last night they won at the Ethnic Business Awards the trophy for Champions of Champions in the category of the best of all finalists over the last 25 years of the Ethnic Business Awards, which is a very well known business awards run by the Assaf family. Joseph and Angela Assaf founded it. It has been going 25 years. It has had sponsors like the National Australia Bank and SBS for all that time. It is a very prestigious award to have won, and I was pleased to be able to be at the dinner in the Great Hall last night and be sitting with the Romeo family. I congratulate Antonio and Elizabeth Romeo from my electorate; their sons, Paul, Anthony and Joseph; their daughter, Cathy; and Cathy's husband, Pat; all of whom are to varying degrees involved with a very successful South Australian business. Congratulations to that family.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Bass</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">13:54</span>):  I rise in the House today to speak about the success of Tasmanian cyclist Richie Porte. The former Launcestonian and Sky team rider will on Saturday embark on the world's biggest sporting event: the 2013 Tour de France. This exciting event proves beneficial to the advancement of Porte's career as it has been identified as a doorway to greater opportunities with his team. Although he will play a supporting role in the event, Porte's continued success and excellent performances in his professional career so far have cemented his place in Team Sky. This is highlighted by an impressive confirmation that Porte is to lead his team in the Giro d'Italia next year, emphasising the strong future his team envisages for him in fulfilling his aspirations to take on a leadership role.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Embracing each and every opportunity to lead his team, Porte has shown his dedication and commitment to the sport and his team by utilising his lead rider status to the best of his abilities in the shorter races last year. In doing so, he was able to deliver an overall win in France and a second place in Spain. Taking up road cycling at 21, Porte has quickly become an accomplished world-class athlete. We wish him all the best for his future. This is a great Tasmanian from the great electorate of Bass.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Dawson</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">13:56</span>):  While Labor squabbles about leadership, there are real issues to focus on. In Mackay every weekday, morning and afternoon, workers battle with capital city style traffic congestion, which is fine if you are in a capital city with all of the benefits and services of a capital city but not when you are in Mackay in regional Australia. When we had a truck turn over on Nebo Road, the city came to a literal standstill. Traffic was backed up all the way over Ron Camm Bridge, and people were an hour or more late to work. This is why the Mackay ring road is a desperately needed project.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The Prime Minister came to Mackay on 24 April and indicated to the people that there would be funding for the ring road in the 2013-14 financial year. When the budget came down three weeks later, guess what—no ring road. There was no funding allocation for that project. The Minister for Infrastructure and Transport says that it is part of the Bruce Highway package. That is a package that does not start until 2014-15, so how can funding in that year be funding something in the 2013-14 financial year? Labor's delays in funding push the project back by more than a year. That is a year longer that people are going to have to contend with traffic jams and road chaos throughout Mackay. I have several hundred letters here for the Prime Minister saying, 'Prime Minister, please keep your ring road funding promise.' I seek leave to table that document.</span>

These awards are very important and are awarded on the International Day of People with Disability, which is in December. These awards are exceptionally important, and I encourage those members and anyone listening to nominate someone you know for these awards, because it is great to celebrate those achievements.</span>

Eddie Liu OBE, OAM was an outstanding man. My family has known the Liu family for over 30 years, and there is no doubt that Eddie contributed to the multicultural Australia that we know today. I want to praise him for the work he has done with the Chinese community over many long years from when he first arrived in Melbourne in 1937. He helped Chinese immigrants obtain jobs, he helped them settle in Australia, and he did many great works, particularly in the community. I want to acknowledge the great work he did in the Royal Children's Hospital in Brisbane, his fundraising work for the Leukaemia Foundation and his fundraising work for Guide Dogs. He also arranged for young liver transplant patients to be funded for operations in China. His incredible generosity of spirit is to be remembered always, as is his very famous Chinese New Year dinner that many of us on both sides of the House have attended. I wish to express my condolences to his family and to his children on this very sad day.</span>

Early in 1963 land was excised from the Arnhem Land reserve to allow bauxite mining on the lands of the Yolngu people. It happened without consultation; it happened without compensation. Fifty years ago the Yolngu brought their grievance into the home of our great democracy. They crafted two elaborate bark paintings into the centre of which they pasted typewritten petitions. Beautiful and painstaking as the ochre images are on those sheets of bark, they were not intended as decorative. For the Yolngu they constituted a legal document, an assertion of their title to the land rendered in images of deep significance and power. The pasted typewritten sheets bearing the names of the petitioners simply articulated the same claim for land title in a language a parliament 4,000 kilometres away might understand. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The presentation of the Yirrkala bark petitions to this House and the Senate in August 1963 was the first time an Aboriginal legal document was recognised by an Australian parliament, a bridge between two noble legal traditions: the laws of our young Commonwealth and the ancient laws of an ancient people. The Yolngu did not succeed in stopping the mining but the political and social processes those petitions set in motion led to the Aboriginal Land Rights (Northern Territory) Act, culminating three decades later in Mabo and more recently in the apology and the historic Gove agreement that I was privileged to witness being signed two years ago.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Today the Yirrkala bark petitions are rightly counted among the founding documents of our nation, so we honour this anniversary and we honour the memory of those proud Australians who came to this parliament in the name of justice. They were right to come. Our nation is more whole and healed because they did.</span>

The Yirrkala bark petition was the first traditional Indigenous petition ever to be received in this parliament. The petition was acknowledged but not actually acted upon. As the Prime Minister has noted, that which the Yolngu were complaining about went ahead. Nevertheless, it was the beginning of this parliament's consciousness that there were and are in this country Indigenous cultures and Indigenous peoples whose traditions should be respected. Since then we have seen the 1967 referendum, land rights legislation, native title legislation and the national apology. And who knows? If we are our best selves we may soon see Indigenous recognition in the Constitution. This event which we remember today was a small step but it was a first step in a long journey which I hope our nation can soon complete.</span>

That is not covered by current carbon pricing legislation. There is absolutely no proposal or suggestion by the government that it does. I think that the Leader of the Opposition is well aware that the problem with the farm sector is that there is no reliable way of measuring emissions and that means that it is not possible for the farm sector to be covered by carbon pricing. However, it is possible for the farm sector to benefit from carbon reduction arrangements. We have ensured that farming does benefit through our Carbon Farming Initiative. </span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I want to pay some tribute to Tony Windsor and Rob Oakeshott on the design of this. It is an important way for farmers to realise additional value from their land by ensuring that their farming practices assist our environment by taking carbon pollution out of the atmosphere and storing it in the soil. We have made sure that there is a stream of assistance and a stream of funding that can reward our farmers for those best practice endeavours. </span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">Of course, all of that is at risk from the Leader of the Opposition's policies and plans. He is right to point out to this parliament that the government being re-elected in September will give the nation stability on carbon pricing. What he ought to do is point out very clearly the alternative, which is, if he is elected, there will be complete chaos because of the half-baked nature of his policies and plans and his plan to throw the Australian economy and the Australian nation into turmoil to try and get rid of a carbon pricing policy which he used to support, which he stood on a platform in 2007 in favour of and which he knows in his heart of hearts is working.</span>

Because the Leader of the Opposition is unable to win a debate on the facts, he is always reduced to this and it is somewhat embarrassing for him. What I can say to the Leader of the Opposition is that they are in the history of carbon pricing in this country, Prime Minister Howard in 2007 indicated to the Australian electorate that he favoured an emissions trading scheme, as did the Leader of the Opposition.</span>

                  </a>  The member for Mackellar is yelling out, 'And he lost the election.' The climate sceptics are alive and well on the front bench of the opposition, repudiating the political legacy of John Howard. It is quite remarkable. Prime Minister Howard stood for election wanting to have an emissions trading scheme. The Leader of the Opposition stood at his side wanting to have an emissions trading scheme. This government since its election has fought for an emissions trading scheme and now that emissions trading scheme is the law of this country. So the law of this country is stable, is strong and is working. The threat to that is the Leader of the Opposition's ridiculous plans, completely unable to be explained, to subsidise polluters and to waste money from families doing that. The Leader of the Opposition's threat to the Australian economy which all of this chaos and turmoil would cause— <span style="font-style:italic;">(Time expired)</span></span>

It is that the Senate has now passed our Australian Education Bill. It is now the law of this country: a plan for school improvement and a plan for better funding of Australian schools. </span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">What the passing of this legislation means is that six out of 10 children in Australian schools are now covered by our new funding plans and our plan for school improvement. That is great news for children around the country: in independent schools, in Catholic schools, the children who go to New South Wales schools, the children who go to schools in the ACT and the children who go to schools in South Australia. What they will see from this government is increased resources in their schools, combined with a new way of working which we know lifts outcomes for children. We know it because we have proved it in the national partnership schools where we are already working. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">What remains is for those conservative leaders in the other jurisdictions to step forward and put the children in their schools first. What an absurdity it would be for the Premier of Victoria or the Premier of Queensland to countenance a situation where children in New South Wales had a better resourced education than the children in their schools, where the schools within their jurisdiction were subject to different funding arrangements.

                <span class="HPS-Normal">So these vital reforms are not put at risk, we also need the Leader of the Opposition to turn away from his destructive plan, the way in which he is putting pressure on conservative leaders to not endorse our plans for school improvement and the way in which he is going to the next election threatening to cut our schools to the bone. Our kids deserve better. They deserve a world-class education. Six out of 10 Australian children can look forward to that world-class education because of the actions of this Labor government and the laws that have passed the parliament today. I ask the Leader of the Opposition to not put that at risk for Australia's children.</span>

Growth in our economy is solid—growth of 0.6 for the quarter and 2.5 per cent for the year. We have a very strong and solid investment pipeline. In the past three years we have seen the creation of 500,000 jobs—one million jobs in the time that the government have been in power. There has been a surge in investment. All of these things indicate an economy which is in good shape—14 per cent bigger than it was at the end of 2007, eight per cent bigger in the last three years alone. </span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">Of course, there are challenges in our economy and we are an economy which is in transition. But one of the reasons that we are in a position of strength to handle those transitions is due to what this government did to handle the global financial crisis. Because we handled it so well, we did not suffer the very high levels of unemployment and capital destruction that occurred right around the world. If those opposite had had their way, this would not have happened and Australia would have suffered massively high unemployment and capital destruction.</span>

                  </a>  We on this side of the House are proud of what we have done with an emissions trading scheme and carbon pricing—absolutely proud. In the time that carbon pricing has been operating, 150,000 jobs have been created in Australia. So you can come into this House, as you do, every day, every week, every month, every year and talk our economy down, but on this side of the House we will take the decisions for the future—the decisions to invest and to make sure that we have a fiscal policy which supports growth and jobs. </span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">If those opposite had been in power when the last budget was brought down, we would have seen them bring in European style austerity policies. They would have taken an axe to spending, particularly in health and education. But they come into this House every day and say that we are spending too much, and they will not say where they are going to cut to the bone if they are elected. </span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">They hide behind a commission of audit—the formula of Premier Newman in Queensland. That will not wash with the Australian people. On this side of the House, we will always support jobs and growth because we understand how important jobs are to the livelihood and living standards of all Australians. When the acid was on, where were those opposite? They went missing and the Leader of the Opposition missed five votes in this House—the critical votes which saved our economy from recession. They are simply unfit for high office.</span>

This government will always put hardworking Australians and their living standards first. That is what we did back in 2009 when those critical votes were taking place in this parliament on 13 and 14 March of that year, when the Leader of the Opposition could not come into the House and support or oppose critical bills which saved our country from recession. He could not do it. He could not even walk into this House and have the courage of his convictions to vote against those bills. But the Liberal Party voted against those bills. If they had had their way, we would have experienced a recession and we would not be in the position of strength that we are in now. </span>

But we also understand that we have to make sure we put in place the investments for the future and that is what we did in our recent budget. We have fully funded our education reforms. Everyone on this side is proud of those bills which have just gone through the Senate today because they go to the heart of extending our economic capacity. We are investing in our people for the decades ahead and meeting the challenge of the Asian century by lifting the standards of education of all of our children. </span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">We also understand that what we need to do is to lift our national savings and that is why we are increasing the superannuation guarantee from nine to 12 per cent. We support dignity in retirement and adequate living standards for people who retire. We also understand that national savings are critical to our economic future. During the global financial crisis, it was our national savings superannuation pool that assisted all of our businesses to get through that crisis. But we need to build it up again. Half a trillion dollars will be added to that superannuation pool by the investments that we are making and the people of Australia are making in superannuation. </span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">What that means to a 30-year-old on average wages, if they knock off the increases in the superannuation guarantee, is $127,000 at retirement. These are big differences in the investments and reforms we have to make to grow our economy, to give people security and to lift their living standards. But on every one of these we are opposed by those opposite. We understand the importance of jobs and growth. We understand the importance of lifting living standards. Those opposite simply want to wreck them.</span>

I remind the Prime Minister that in this White House statement on climate change there is no mention of any plans for the US to impose an economy-wide pricing scheme. Instead, the US is taking a direct action approach like the coalition's policy. Why won't the Prime Minister finally admit that her carbon tax is pushing up electricity prices, decreasing investment and damaging trade-exposed industries and costing jobs, and rescind the increase in the carbon tax next Monday?</span>

Now they are prepared to come in here and misrepresent policy statements by President Obama. It is quite a remarkable thing that the opposition would come into this parliament and do that—misrepresent a statement by President Obama. No-one who has followed this debate could possibly come to the conclusion that the member for Indi has come to—that the statement by the President of the United States in any way endorses or backs in the 'subsidies for polluters' approach that the opposition has endorsed. President Obama is not talking about that. President Obama, with the congress that he works with, has to take a regulatory approach. It is no secret that the American congress tried to find a consensus around carbon pricing and, because of the hyperpartisanship there—which has infected the opposition here, getting their tactics as they do from the Tea Party—that the American administration was not able to find that consensus in congress. President Obama has decided to take a regulatory approach about emissions intensity from things like power stations, not in any way an endorsement of or comparable to the opposition's 'subsidy for polluters' plan.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">What is remarkable here is that the opposition now comes into this parliament day after day and puts questions to me, saying, 'Why isn't Australia's carbon pricing scheme more like someone else's in another part of the world?' I have taken questions about the scheme in New Zealand, for example. This is a complete reversal of a major section of the opposition's fear campaign, because they used to wander around the country and come into this parliament saying no-one in any part of the world was acting. We were the only people acting. How foolhardy was it for Australia to go it alone, they used to say. That was a very strong part of their fear campaign. Now they come into this parliament instead and say, 'Can we have a scheme like someone else's?' You cannot pursue both lines of argument. Yes, we are tackling carbon pollution. Yes, the rest of the world is tackling carbon pollution. Yes, the political party getting left behind by the tide of human history is the Liberal Party. You used to be better than this under Prime Minister Howard when you believed in rational economic principles and an emissions trading scheme. Now, under this Leader of the Opposition, for a bit of cheap politics you have turned your back on that and you should be ashamed of it.</span>

Prime Minister, as you know I secured $20 million in government funding to clean up Tuggerah Lakes. Are you willing to permit further funding to ensure that the lakes are clean and this wonderful natural asset of ours continues to have the necessary environmental work done to continue the long term job of rehabilitating Tuggerah Lakes?</span>

I acknowledge that he has pursued this issue for a long period of time for his community and that he is very concerned about water quality in his local lakes at Tuggerah Lakes. I can also confirm, as the member has said in his question, that as part of our 2007 election commitments we did indicate that we would provide $20 million to improve water quality management. That was done and that project is currently being delivered by the Wyong Shire Council. It is being done in two stages: stage 1 of this project has been committed and, I think, probably completed; and stage 2 is on track for completion in 2013.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">I do understand that the member and his local council want to see more work done on water quality in these lakes. I understand how deep this runs in his community because I know that of the work done so far close to 1,300 volunteers have been involved in this work and in like works around the country. That is a huge number of people who care very deeply about water quality. I can also say to the member that I am aware that Wyong Shire Council has applied for funding under the competitive grant rounds of the Caring for Our Country program. All applications submitted in that competitive grants round are assessed under the guidelines. They need to meet the criteria of eligibility and merit. That is a process that needs to be seen through, and seen through properly.</span>

I know that he, along with other Victorian members, has followed with some sense of concern the engagement between the federal government and the Victorian government. They know that they can now look across the New South Wales border, or look across the border into South Australia, and see schools that are going to benefit from our new funding and our plans for school improvement and they have worried that the children in their local schools will be left behind.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I am therefore very pleased to be able to say to the member for Deakin, and the House, that the Premier of Victoria has just written to me to outline a position on school funding. I welcome his letter and his readiness to engage in this negotiation. It is not before time but it shows that he recognises that school funding reform and school improvement cannot be ignored. The Australian Education Act, as I advised the parliament a little bit earlier in question time, is now law. It delivers an entitlement to excellent school funding that every student in Australia should be able to benefit from. I can confirm to the House that I am willing to negotiate with the Victorian Premier in good faith to deliver an outcome for Victorian schools. Of course, the terms of the arrangement will be the same as the ones we have signed with New South Wales, South Australia and the ACT. The Victorian Premier needs to show that he is making a basic commitment to doing his part in investing in Victorian schools. The offer I have made is a good one, basically a two-for-one funding deal between the federal government and the state government of Victoria.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I can confirm that the legislation we have passed provides for the empowerment of school communities and principals and the flexibility and diversity of schools and school systems, including in Victoria. I very much welcome the step forward taken by the Premier of Victoria today. I look forward to working with him in good faith to make sure that Victorian students are not left behind and that our nation is offering them a world-class education as their birthright.</span>

If this country were faced with the sort of austerity policies put forward by the shadow minister for finance over there and our shadow Treasurer, the doors of small businesses would be closing right around the country. Of course, as everybody here knows, that was something they were particularly indifferent to at the end of February 2009, when they voted against a whole range of measures to support demand and to support small businesses in our community. We are particularly proud of what we have done in this area and most particularly we are proud of the initiative we have put in place through the instant asset write-off—a $6,500 instant asset write-off for millions of small businesses right around our country.

They want to go round as part of their fear campaign and argue that somehow it is imposed directly on a whole host of businesses. He knows that is not true; it is simply part of their continuous fearmongering to obscure the fact that if they were in charge of this country they would take the axe to spending and they would send unemployment through the roof. That would lead to business closures. That is the sort of austerity plan they have for Australia, which they are trying to hide behind a commission of audit. There has been an experiment in this country in recent times. It is from Premier Newman in Queensland and it has produced the worst economic results of any state in the country.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Charlton</span>—<span class="HPS-MinisterialTitles">Minister for Climate Change, Industry and Innovation</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">14:34</span>):  I would like to thank the member for Throsby for his question, because too often we hear these issues about climate change and action being taken in other countries misrepresented. We have heard it just a moment ago from the member for Indi, misrepresenting President Obama's speech last night outlining a plan to take action on climate change in the United States. Of course the opposition leader is a serial offender in this regard, constantly misrepresenting the action that is taken by our major trading partners on the issue of climate change—all pure deceit and mendacity, time and time again.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We know that carbon pricing started last week in Shenzhen in China and it will shortly commence in a number of other cities and provinces throughout China. Overnight President Obama announced a comprehensive plan to tackle climate change in the US. As the Prime Minister brought to the attention of the House a moment ago, he did emphasise his preference for a market-based mechanism to deal with this issue. But, of course, Republicans in the US congress, like the Liberal Party here, have been captured by extremists who block rational economic policymaking and deny facts and deny the climate science. That is what we are dealing with on that side of the House and that is what President Obama is dealing with in the US congress. President Obama's plan includes measures to reduce emissions from coal fired power generation, to support renewable energy, to promote energy efficiency and to promote investment in clean energy innovation. It builds on the emissions trading scheme arrangements that already exist in a number of US states, including the state of California, which has an emissions trading scheme in place. President Obama made absolutely clear and unequivocal his respect for the climate science and also had this to say:</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Small">… I don't have much patience for anyone who denies that this challenge is real. We don't have time for a meeting of the Flat Earth Society.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The convener of the flat earth society in Australia sits over there. The opposition leader describes the science as absolute crap. What a disreputable position for a political leader in this country, to deny facts and science. He went around the country with his mendacious campaign: Whyalla wiped off the map; prices going through the roof; we would not be able to afford anything; 'the cost of living'; 'It's going to destroy the economy.' Hundreds of thousands of jobs were going to go. 'The US is doing nothing. China is doing nothing. Why on earth would Australia be doing anything at all?' That is the deception that has gone up and up and up. The emissions are coming down and down and down. We have made a great Labor reform and your position is a moral disgrace. <span style="font-style:italic;">(Time expired)</span></span>

I remind the Prime Minister that, when the carbon tax was introduced, Treasury assumed that a coordinated international regime would ensure a harmonised world carbon price by 2016. Given not one of China, the US, India, Russia and Japan have enforceable abatement commitments in place and it is now clear that the carbon tax was introduced based on a false assumption, why won't the Prime Minister rescind the increase in the carbon tax next Monday?</span>

I am very interested in the nature of the opposition's questions today, because we are scrambling around again now that the fear campaign is running out of any factual content. They used to come into this parliament and say no-one in the world was acting; now they come into this parliament and use examples of nations that are acting. They used to come into this parliament and complain about the whole of carbon pricing; now they seem to be narrowing their opposition down to scheduled increases in carbon pricing. That is a little bit interesting, isn't it? I wonder where that is going to lead to under the opposition, I genuinely do.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">Let me assure you, there are many Australians who listen to the Leader of the Opposition on carbon pricing and his plans to say that he will repeal carbon pricing. They look at him and they wonder about his intentions. They should watch this question time today.</span>

                  </a>  The opposition is obviously in a state of movement about what it thinks about carbon pricing. But against that let me say to the member: the same Treasury people—the people of the same professionalism who advised the Howard government that an emissions trading scheme was the best way and least-cost way of reducing carbon pollution—have advised this government of that fact. It is a fact that carbon pricing is the best way and least-cost way of reducing carbon pollution. John Howard knew that. The Leader of the Opposition knew that when he was on the government benches. The Leader of the Opposition has said that even when he has been opposition leader, and people around the world know it.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">To the member's question: because the rest of the world is addressing carbon pollution, we as a nation must act too, we are acting and, as we act, we act in the least-cost way. That is the responsible thing to do. Why would you want our nation to pay more than it needs to pay to reduce carbon pollution? Prime Minister John Howard did not want to do that; he wanted the least-cost approach. We have taken the least-cost approach. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The problem for the member is he is handcuffed to a policy of subsidising polluters which increases the costs to our nation of addressing carbon pollution. What he is really asking is that every family and every business in his community says yes to the nation paying more than it needs to pay to reduce carbon pollution. It is an absurdity, a policy absurdity—a mendacious claim that has led to a policy absurdity. We on this side of the parliament stand for the stability and certainty which come from pursuing carbon pricing as legislated into Australian law, because it is working. <span style="font-style:italic;">(Time expired)</span></span>

This government is about making sure that we do things which will make a difference to Australia, bringing in big reforms that will improve our country now and for the future, whether it is a price on carbon, the National Broadband Network or a national disability insurance scheme. And today the parliament has passed the Australian Education Bill to put in place for the first time ever a needs based funding system to support school education in our nation. This is a very big, very important day in the history of education in Australia. It is a proud day for this government to see this reform now in law. I want to place on record my appreciation for all the work that has been done by officials here and officials at the state level and by the education sector itself. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I know on this side of the House we have always understood how important it is to provide additional investment in school education to kids anywhere in the country, no matter where they live and no matter how much money their parents earn. For the first time we have a needs based funding system. For the first time we want to provide additional investments across the support for education on the things that can make a difference in a school.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I am asked by the member: what will this mean for students? The fact is, it will mean focused, targeted support in things like literacy in the early years of primary school. It will mean that kids that need special support, if they have a special need or a disability, will get it and will get it in a way that makes a difference to their learning. It means that principals will have more autonomy in schools to make decisions on what happens. It means we will have better training for teachers, the most important people in the classroom when the kids come to school. And it means that we have a national plan for school improvement, agreed by state and non-government school systems, that is focused on getting us back into the top five performing nations in education by 2025. This government does not want to see a single child left behind. The only way that we can do that is by making sure that we invest in education in a way that is targeted and focused on the things that make a difference.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">They have crawled into a small ball on the other side of the House, but when I am asked what this means for students, it is now important for the premiers of states that have not yet signed up—the Premier of Victoria, the door is now open and that is welcome news; the Premier of Queensland, with some $3.8 billion of additional investment ready; the Premier of Western Australia; and, of course, the Chief Minister of the Northern Territory. At the end of the day this government and this party understand that a fair funding system means that every young Australian can reach their full potential and contribute to the great nation that is ours and the great challenges that we have in the future.</span>

There are various stages of assessment of asylum seeker claims, and when people present and raise no reasonable prospect that they have a protection claim when it is clear that they are seeking, to use the terminology, to be economic migrants—that is, that they have come here for economic reasons—then we endeavour to promptly return people. For example, with the outflow from Sri Lanka, we are very promptly returning people. Indeed, we have returned more than 1,000 people because they have been screened out of any assessment process because they are economic migrants.</span>

I understand it to be bipartisan policy that we be signatories to the refugee convention, and if people raise a credible claim then that claim is appropriately assessed. That is, it is assessed in the same way that claims have been assessed in this country for some period. These are not just the policies of one side of politics—they are assessed by the department and then there are various review levels, including the Refugee Review Tribunal. I remind the member opposite who asked the question that when she sat on the government benches this also used to occur. Out of those processes, yes, there is screening, so that if people are economic migrants and not engaging our protection obligations we move promptly to return them.</span>

That is what we do, as advised by experts through the Houston panel. That is not what the opposition does; it would prefer to stay with its negativity and its simplistic slogans, to come into the parliament and vote for more boats.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">Australian families face a very clear choice in the coming election: a clear choice between a Labor government that wants to deliver the support that families need and those opposite, a Liberal Party that will cut to the bone. Labor delivered the schoolkids bonus, and that is delivering much-needed support to families. From next week families will start to get the second schoolkids bonus, which will be paid into families' bank accounts, and 1.3 million families will receive this extra money. Those families with a child in secondary school will receive $410 and those with a child in primary school will receive $205. This is much-needed assistance for families to help with the cost of school uniforms, winter sports gear and making sure that families get that extra help with schoolbooks as children go into term 3.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We know that those opposite have one plan. They might not have many plans, but they do have one: to abolish the schoolkids bonus, to claw back all of this money—they just think it is a joke. This opposition would take $15,000 out of the pockets of an ordinary family over the school lives of their children. That is what those opposite want to do.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">While we are talking to families about the benefits we are delivering to them, I can inform the House that those opposite do not mind getting some of the family kits from the government. They are out there—the member for Hume, the member for Hughes, the member for Boothby, the members for Riverina, Calare, Grey, and even the whip, the member for Leichhardt—ordering the families kits from the government, telling everyone that they like the schoolkids bonus and how great it is, even though they voted against it and are going to abolish it. Get honest with the Australian people.</span>

It is a system that now applies to six out of 10 children—an historic Labor reform. It has been 40 years since school funding was properly looked at. We have worked on this patiently over five years, and today it has gone through the parliament. Yes, of course, we need to strike more agreements with state premiers. That is why we are continuing discussions. I was able to report to the parliament today that the Premier of Victoria has opened the door to those good-faith discussions.

In September, people will have the opportunity to judge who has the best plan for investment in our nation's future and who has a plan to cut to the bone and to bring our nation's economy to a standstill by cutting too hard and cutting in the wrong places. The Australian people will make that choice, and I certainly believe the Australian people will vote for a stronger, smarter and fairer future under a Labor government.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">I move this motion as standing orders must be suspended because right now in this building no-one is interested in the proceedings of this parliament; everyone is interested in the conversations that are taking place in corridors and the plotting that is going on inside offices.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">What that is all about is yet another deal inside the Labor Party—yet another deal between the faceless men to try to work out which particular leader is going to give them the best chance of winning the election. I say that the public are sick of the deals behind closed doors. The public are sick of the incompetence. They are sick of the deception. What they want is their chance to determine the future of the country. What they want is their chance to vote for a government and to decide who should be the Prime Minister of this country—and they deserve it sooner than it will happen under the current Prime Minister. The poison inside the Australian Labor Party is paralysing government in this country, and every hour, every day, that this is not resolved, the paralysis inside the government just gets worse and worse. That is why standing orders should be suspended.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We saw today indications that the strongest supporters of this Prime Minister—the member for Lyne and the member for New England—are not going to contest the election. We see the tremors of leadership change shaking the foundations of this parliament. Well, I say: let's debate it honestly in this chamber. Let the Prime Minister say honestly why she should retain the job. Let the member for Griffith say honestly why he should be given the job. But, above all else, let the Australian people have their chance to decide who should be the Prime Minister of this country and let that chance come as soon as possible.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We deserve so much better than this. I say to the Australian people: do not think that what you have seen over the last three years is the best that this parliament can do. We can do so much better for you than this Prime Minister and this government have done for you—and we will do it if we are given the chance at the forthcoming election. Let's bring on the election and let's put the future of this country in the hands of the people rather than allowing it to continue to be traded by the faceless men in their ceaseless quest to come up with a less unpopular Prime Minister than the one we currently have.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Standing orders must be suspended, because this is the only question that is really consuming the members of this parliament right now. The only question that can plausibly and credibly be before the parliament right now is: how can we get a better government and how can we resolve the problems facing our country? The only way to get a better government is to have an election. The only way to resolve the problems facing this country is to get a better government, and the only way we can do that is with an election.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">It gives me no joy to say in the course of this motion to suspend standing orders that we all wished the Prime Minister well when she came into office on 24 June 2010. I was very conscious, as the father of three daughters, of just what a milestone in our national life had been achieved. I was conscious of the significance of the occasion. And, while I deeply regretted the sustained plotting and treachery that had resulted in the change of leadership, nevertheless, I thought that it was an opportunity for our country to make a new beginning.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">A good government, she said, had lost its way. But what we now know from subsequent statements by this Prime Minister is that even she knew that it was a bad government. It was not a good government that it had lost its way; it was a bad government, paralysed by chaos and dysfunction, because the member for Griffith was incapable of adequately leading it. The trouble—and this is why the standing orders should be suspended—is that every single problem has just got worse in the three years since that 24 June. She said she was going to fix the climate change issue. What did we get? We got the pre-election declaration 'There will be no carbon tax under the government I lead' and the post-election decision to have a carbon tax. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">So the Prime Minister's leadership was paralysed from the outset by two acts of deception, two acts of treachery. That is why standing orders should be suspended. First of all there was the betrayal of the member for Griffith, the former Prime Minister, then there was the betrayal of the Australian people through the carbon tax that was never going to happen. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">But the betrayal went on. There was the betrayal of the member for Denison, Mr Wilkie, who was going to get poker machine reform but he did not. There was the betrayal of the member for Scullin, the former Speaker, whose speakership was terminated because it suited the political convenience of the Prime Minister to do so. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">There has been the sheer incompetence of a government and a Prime Minister which cannot get its spending under control, which is why standing orders should be suspended. There was the mining tax that was going to raise $30-odd billion but, instead, has raised a tiny, tiny fraction—some five per cent—of the promised revenue. That is why standing orders should be suspended. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Then there is the disaster on our borders, and whether the member for Lalor or the member for Griffith is the Prime Minister of this country and is leading the Labor Party for the time being, neither of them have a clue how to resolve it. That is why standing orders should be suspended, because the only way to resolve the disaster on our borders is to put in place a strong government led by ministers who know what they are doing. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">This is such a great country. We are such a proud people. We have such a great future, but it is time the people of Australia were allowed to choose their government. It is time the people of Australia were allowed to choose their Prime Minister. We have seen three years of minority government. We have seen enough. We know it does not work, and why should we limp on for another 80 days of confusion and paralysis under the current regime? </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">One of the things that the Australian people find so humiliating at this time is that they know their future is at least as much in the hands of unelected union leaders as it is in the hands of elected members of parliament. This is why standing orders should be suspended. Don't we know that in the end all of this for the last three years has been about the unions? The AWU boss went on <span style="font-style:italic;">Lateline</span> on that famous night to say that the Prime Minister's polling had collapsed, therefore he should be replaced. Now, of course, the same gentleman goes on <span style="font-style:italic;">Lateline</span>—and this is why standing orders should be suspended—to say, <span style="&#xD;&#xA;    font-family:Tahoma;&#xD;&#xA;  ">'</span>Sure, the Prime Minister's polling has collapsed but, above all else, we must keep the current Prime Minister.' It is all about the unions. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I say forget the unions. Let's think about the people. Let's give the people a say in who should be their Prime Minister and who should be their government. I say what we should have in this country is democracy of the people by the people for the people, not of the people by the unions for the unions. Let's support this motion. Let's have an election.</span>

I say that I do so much more in sorrow than I do in anger, because I do feel sorry for my country. I feel sorry that this country has had to put up with a government that has become such a shambles, such a dysfunctional embarrassment, that has made us the laughing stock of our region and in some quarters in the world.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">I am sorry that we have had to move this motion today, because what we are seeing at the moment in Australia is a Prime Minister who has gone from being the hunter to the hunted. She started as Lady Macbeth three years ago, and this week we see her in the role of Madam Defarge, who thought she was going to an execution and it turned out to be her own. </span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">Today or tomorrow the Labor Party appears to be moving against the Prime Minister. Yet again, three years later almost to the day, the faceless men of the ALP in their desperate attempt to scramble onto any floating boat, any floating device, believe that if they execute the Prime Minister politically they may save themselves and the little bit of power that they have in the Labor caucus.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">But what are they changing to, if they do indeed change? What have they said about this apparent white knight riding over the hills to save the Labor Party—one of the worst governments in Australia's history? Who could serve on the frontbench under a government that is headed by the member for Griffith? A litany of ministers have said they would not serve: the Treasurer, the minister for communications, the minister for schools, the minister for early childhood, the minister for trade, the Minister for Health, the minister for resources. Seven ministers, most of them cabinet ministers, would immediately be forced to resign if the Labor Party returns to the member for Griffith—a worse day of knives than the one that saw the Prime Minister seeing off the putative challenge in March this year.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">And what if the member for Griffith becomes the Prime Minister again? How could he lead a party that has refused to be led by him before? The Treasurer said about the member for Griffith:</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Grayndler</span>—<span class="HPS-MinisterialTitles">Leader of the House, Minister for Infrastructure and Transport and Minister for Regional Development and Local Government</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">15:09</span>):  I rise for the 81st time in this parliament to oppose a suspension of standing orders moved by those opposite. What we have seen from those opposite in recent times is an attempt by this bloke to remake himself into 'human' Tony. 'Human' Tony, standing up and moving a suspension of standing orders—allegedly more in regret, more in sorrow, than in anger. 'Angry' Tony has been put aside. That Mark Riley moment, the death stare, we have not seen for some time.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">
                  <a href="R36" type="MemberContinuation">
                    <span class="HPS-MemberContinuation">Mr ALBANESE:</span>
                  </a>  What we should not do is indulge this Leader of the Opposition and that is why we should not suspend standing orders.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">What we did hear from the Leader of the Opposition was the complete absence of a single policy idea. Here we are, the second last sitting day of this term, and not a single policy idea from the Leader of the Opposition or from the Manager of Opposition Business. I will tell you what: over coming months, up until September, they will not be able to get away with having no education policy, having no health policy, having no detailed policy whatsoever. We on this side of the House have a plan for the future of the nation. Those opposite exposed themselves early on when the Leader of the Opposition stood up at the beginning of this debate and he said, 'No-one's interested in the parliament.' He is right that he is not interested in the parliament, but that does not excuse his projection.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">What we have had in this parliament today—today the Australian education bills passed the parliament—is a significant reform for the future of our young people. Earlier today, just prior to question time, we had the first stages passed—the second reading—of the 457 legislation. It is important legislation saying simply this: that before a 457 is applied for, we should advertise and see if Australian workers are available first. Not a radical proposition, one would have thought, but of course opposed by those opposite.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The fact is we have engaged for three years in having to put up with the longest dummy spit in Australian political history, because they do not see—it is not that they do not see this government as being legitimate because it is Labor; they do not see any Labor government as being legitimate. They are born to rule, these Tories opposite. Born to rule, so they believe they have a right to the government benches, which is why they failed so dismally during the 17 days of negotiations with the crossbench.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Those opposite also said, 'We know it doesn't work.' Really? Five hundred and ninety pieces of legislation, important reform: putting a price on carbon; the Australian education bills; disability reform; in the area of the environment, the largest ever marine parks in the world; the Tasmanian forestry reforms; aged-care legislation. Right across the whole spectrum we have seen reform pass this House because we have been prepared to engage in serious policy debates. The future is not assured, it cannot be taken for granted. That is why you have to do the hard work.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">And we on this side of the House do have a philosophical difference to those opposite. We believe that government has the ability to empower people and opportunity. We believe that government can play a positive role in people's lives. Those opposite think if government just gets out of the way and leaves it to market forces, it will all be okay. There is the fundamental difference. However, the carbon sceptics have also become the market sceptics. On the other side of the House they have no plan for the future, only three-word slogans. They are policy lightweights. They have no costings of any policies—they are trying to skate through to the election—and yet we have criticism from them of this government's performance.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Well, let's just see. Let's do a comparison of how this Treasurer has delivered in terms of the Australian economy. Have a look at this: federal Labor, 5.1 per cent; under Howard, 6.4. That was the monthly average. That sounds better. Inflation: 2.5 per cent under us; 2.6 under them. That sounds better. Home loan mortgage rate: 6.4 compared with 7.3. That sounds better. Household savings: 8.9 per cent compared with 2.3. That sounds better. Tax as a percentage of GDP: 22 per cent rather than 23.4 per cent. It reached a high of 24.2 under those opposite. That sounds better as well. Government spending: average annual growth under us, 2.9; under them, 3.3—larger government spending under the Howard government. The investment pipeline is $560 billion under us; it was $213 billion when we took office. That sounds better as well.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">On infrastructure, my portfolio, we were ranked as a nation 20th out of 25 OECD countries when I got sworn in as the minister. Now we are second in the world, creating future productivity growth. Those opposite are not quite sure whether Infrastructure Australia is a good idea or whether they should claim it and say they are going to create it—a farcical situation!</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Why shouldn't we suspend standing orders? Why do I raise those figures? Because they are trying to knock off their own MPI, which would have been raised if they had just sat there and is from the shadow Treasurer on the 'adverse impact of the government's economic policies on confidence'. No wonder they do not want a debate about economic policy. They come in here and move a suspension rather than have an MPI debate on economic policy, because we know that they have absolutely nothing to say.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">What we saw from them today, on the day that Barack Obama made a historic speech about tackling climate change and just after China started an ETS that is bigger than ours, was bizarre. In that context, and on the second last day here, you can imagine their tactics committee this morning: 'I know—we haven't had a crack about climate change for a while, let's have a go.'</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Well, let's have a look at what the figures are, because the markets were going to collapse! The stock market is up 17.5 per cent. The value of shares on the ASX is up $200 billion. The official cash rate is down by 0.75 per cent. Employment is up 164,000. House prices are up 1.7 per cent and the value of housing stock is up $68 billion. Success after success.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">What they tried to do today was have it both ways. They tried to again move a disruptive suspension of standing orders, but they tried to have 'polite' Tony and 'not quite as polite' Chris—because Chris doesn't do polite! They are trying to wipe from history the actions of the suspensions of standing orders and the fact that this bloke 'brutal' Tony went outside to that disgraceful demonstration with those signs about the Prime Minister and was prepared to stand out there and demand an immediate election. And that is what we have seen for three years from those opposite.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">They said this parliament would not work. They are still saying that now even though, demonstrably, it has, and it has a proud legislative record over the last three years. But now, instead of standing in front of those signs that none of them noticed, instead of 'agro' Tony in here, they are trying in the lead-up to the election—</span>

                  </a>  to see him go into a very small ball, a very small target, and sneak through without any policies and without any focus. Well, I tell you what: during this coming election campaign this Leader of the Opposition will have to put forward his policies—he will have to find them on education, on health, on aged care, on infrastructure and on the environment. It is not good enough to say, 'No, no, no, no, no,' for all the weeks of an election campaign. He will have to actually stand up and put forward his alternative vision. We are happy to take on that debate today, tomorrow, next week, next month right up to September. <span style="font-style:italic;">(Time expired)</span></span>

                    <span class="HPS-MemberContinuation">Mr KATTER:</span>
                  </a>  For people who cannot do any homework, they have never done any research but are very good on personal invective—that is their characteristic, their laugh. That is their intellectual contribution, to laugh. We say that more people are dying of motor vehicle emissions than motor vehicle accidents. The government continue to do nothing about it. A former Premier of New South Wales, Mr Iemma, said that he could not go another day with having the deaths of people on his conscious who simply do not have to die. The Americans went to ethanol not to help their farmers, not to cut themselves off from the $230,000 million that is going to the Middle Eastern oil producers; they did it because of the health results that came out of California, which indicated that maybe tens of thousands of people were dying as a result of motor vehicle emissions </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">So the American government moved the air quality control act. When you go under a certain ozone retention level, when you go to a certain level of pollution, it triggers the air quality control act. That was how ethanol was introduced in the United States. According to newspaper reports, which I hope to verify shortly, America seems to be up around 12 or 15 per cent now. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The American government claim that, over the next five years, they will be self-sufficient in oil. They will not be sending $230,000 million a year to the Middle Eastern oil producers. That money will be going into the pockets of Americans. But, at the present moment, we are sending $19,500 million every year to the Middle Eastern oil producers which we do not have to send them. As we rise up today, we say: 'Do you want to create 50,000 jobs in rural Australia? Do you want to take that $20,000 million which your country is losing every year and give it to Australians instead of rich potentates in Middle Eastern countries?' We are asking you: 'Do you want people to continue to die who simply do not have to die?'</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I refer to the works of Jonathan Streeton, the eminent thoracic surgeon in Melbourne, who has been fighting this battle all his life, and of Professor Carney from the University of Sydney, who has been fighting this battle for most of his life and of all the other heroes in the other countries who have saved millions of lives as a result of the initiative.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">In addition, we have our rural industries in a desperate plight. You would be well aware of this, Mr Deputy Speaker Scott, with the value to your electorate of the ethanol industry. The lot feeders were squealing because they said there would be a 15 per cent rise in grain prices. Heaven only knows! I attended a meeting in Western Australia, in the electorate of the member who was thinking this was funny and jeering at me, and 1,063 attended the meeting. The Liberal senator's contribution was to say, 'I know you all want to exit, and it is our duty to give you an exit with dignity.'</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I asked one of the people there that night, one of the biggest grain producers in Australia, if that was the attitude of people at the meeting. He said that there would not have been a single person of the 1,063 people there—not a single person—that wanted to exit the industry. They desperately wanted to stay on. If there had been an extra 15 per cent over the last 10 years, those people would not be in the dire straits they are in now. As you would be well aware, Mr Deputy Speaker, 15 per cent on your gross for most farmers in this country would be a 100 or 200 per cent increase in your net income or your ability to pay the banks.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">So it is of immense value to the grain industry in Australia. It is of immense value to the cattle industry in Australia, where they would have unlimited amounts of distillers' grain, which is three times more nutritious than ordinary grain and has the same calorific value. In America, when I went over there on an ethanol tour—the only time I have ever been out of Australia—the price was half what it was for conventional grain.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The cattle industry would kiss the ground on which the government walked if we could get hold of that super cheap, super nutritious grain that is available at the present moment—nearly 100 million tonnes of it per year in the United States. We would not be on our knees in the cattle industry if it were not for the stupidity of the government with the live cattle exports decision. Even if that had not occurred, I still suspect that we would be in a hell of a lot of trouble. We would not be in that trouble if we had access to 10 or 20 million tonnes of this super cheap, super nutritious feed.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Finally, in the sugar industry, we were on $270 a tonne—the world price—for 11 years up until about three or four years ago. In Brazil, 40 per cent of their sugar cane went into sugar. For that 40 per cent they were on $270 a tonne, but for 60 per cent of their production they were on over $400 a tonne—so they could cross-subsidise the sugar part of their industry from the ethanol part of their industry. Our sugar industry, our cattle industry and our grain industry would be fixed up, on the experience of what has happened in other countries, if we had this.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The driving imperative in the other countries is pollution. The reason that China, India and Japan have all announced now that they are moving to biofuels is the issue of pollution and of deaths, mainly from particulate but also from carcinogens—I think there are 15 or 20 carcinogens in conventional petrol. Of course, the ultimate argument, as Larry Johnson the father of ethanol in the United States said is that, when you pour petrol into the river, fish die; when you pour ethanol into the river, fish smile. It is pure alcohol.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I conclude on that note. I recommend this bill to the House and say it is a disgrace that the only country on earth now that does not have ethanol is our country. It is a reflection upon every single person in this place that refuses to vote for this bill. I commend the bill and the resolution to the House.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Denison</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">15:41</span>):  It is my pleasure to second the motion of the member for Kennedy and I will speak ever so briefly, if you do not mind. These matters should be debated in this place and it is unfortunate that the member for Kennedy has got so little traction in this parliament with the issue of the mandatory inclusion of ethanol in fuel for road transport. It escapes me why, in Australia, this issue has been so hard and why we have not made more progress by now. It is self-evident that, if we had mandatory ethanol content in fuel for road vehicles, it would help our farmers. It would give them an opportunity to produce other crops and process what would be otherwise be waste and possibly burnt. It would help our farmers including in my home state of Tasmania. Also, it would certainly reduce the cost of fuel for consumers.</span>

                    <span class="HPS-MemberContinuation">Mr WILKIE:</span>
                  </a>  In countries where there is a substantial ethanol content they, as a general rule, have much lower fuel costs. It simply costs a lot less to produce the stuff. With the right government settings it would be a tangible way for this, or a future, government to try to keep a lid on the escalating cost of living for consumers.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">It is also an obvious step towards more sustainable transport in the future. We have only so much oil on the planet and eventually it will run out or, at least for many people, become unaffordable. Yes, we can have electric vehicle; yes, we can do all sorts of things but in the mix, in my opinion, should be a move towards a more sustainable fuel and that, of course, is ethanol.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">It would help clean up the environment, and the member for Kennedy has spoken about some of the health advantages. When you burn ethanol you have less particulates and other pollutants. You will get better health outcomes in a place where there is a heavy reliance on ethanol fuel.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I do want to sound a warning, however. In some countries where ethanol is used in fuel widely, this has resulted in the use of prime agricultural land, which in my opinion should be used for the production of food. I hope the member for Kennedy does not mind me saying this. We do not want to use up our prime agricultural land to produce fuel for cars; we want to produce quality food for people both in our own country and overseas, including people who would otherwise be starving. I disagree, in the strongest possible terms, with the practice in some countries overseas where virgin forest, including jungle, is cleared to grow grains or other plants to produce ethanol fuel. So I sound a warning. This should not be at the expense of our prime agricultural land. It should not be at the expense of our virgin forest and jungle. In Australia we can do it carefully. It would be insane for us to be importing ethanol from countries where they have poor practices when we could produce the fuel in Australia with high-quality practices so we know that our workers are being looked and after getting a decent wage, that our farmers are earning a decent income and that we are doing it in a way that is environmentally responsible.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">So I am delighted to back up the member for Kennedy on this one. I think we should suspend standing orders. There is an urgent need to do that. That is why we should do it in this parliament. We have only got one day and a bit left to go. There are a few other distractions on at the moment. This is important. This is the business of running a country and making for a better country. So I support the member for Kennedy's motion and I hope the parliament will do likewise.</span>

I do want to record my respect for the fact that the member for Kennedy has been a consistent advocate on this issue. He has made almost relentless representations on this issue and is a genuine advocate of this issue—in part, because of the potential economic benefits for industry in his electorate but in part also due to a wider view of the impact that it would have. I say, with respect to the member for Kennedy, having been a long-term advocate he only introduced the bill on Monday; the government is in a position whereby the MPI has been lodged.

                  </a>  The member for Kennedy does make a good point, even though it was quite disorderly. I congratulate him for sneaking that in on the record. In terms of the parliament, at this particular time—it was only introduced this week—we do have a schedule this afternoon whereby the MPI has already been delayed by an opportunistic attempt at suspension No. 81 or 82 from the Leader of the Opposition. Who knows? The shadow Treasurer is looking pretty keen there. He might come up with a policy. So we would not want to delay the opportunity for the opposition to come up with an economic policy; therefore, we do not want to delay the member for North Sydney. We also have a valedictory for the member for New England, and the 457 legislation in its final stages and this needs to pass the House. I am sure the member for Kennedy would not want to be in this chamber after eight o'clock this evening, because there is an event that the member for Kennedy has a keen interest in. Therefore we need to get business done before then. I call upon the House to oppose this particular suspension from the member for Kennedy.</span>

We have tried, across chambers it must be said, to accommodate people so that they can accommodate their family and friends in the gallery. I thank the House for its cooperation on this. I must say that, in terms of the valedictories, I think everyone has had the opportunity to give their valedictory at the appropriate time for retiring members. I think the fact that the member for Hume was able to come back was indeed very positive.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Small">In an uncertain and fast changing world, we walk tall—as a nation confidently living within its means.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">That is what the Treasurer said in May last year. I would suggest that, if delivering a surplus is an endorsement of Labor's policies, then nothing could be a clearer sign of failure than Labor's delivery of a $19 billion deficit. They set the benchmarks. We did not set the benchmarks. They set the benchmark of economic success as their ability to deliver a surplus and live within their means. Worse still, according to the budget papers, there will be no surplus until 2017—four years and two elections into the future. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The Treasurer committed to a surplus this year on more than 350 occasions. So I can understand why Australians are confused about the message coming from the Treasurer and this government. After all, the Treasurer told us that delivering surpluses was about jobs and growth. They have always got a mantra. They always have a focus group tested mantra: jobs and growth, jobs and growth. Their view is that if you repeat it enough the Australian people will simply believe it. But the Australian people do not. The Australian people are much smarter than the Labor Party will ever give them credit for. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Nothing exemplifies that more than the observation from Nouriel Roubini this week. Nouriel Roubini is arguably the finest economic analyst in the world and has been given credit on numerous occasions for picking the GFC when others did not. Nouriel Roubini put out a report on Australia this week, and he said: 'Households clearly remain under pressure. Consumer sentiment has also taken a hit due to the government's big miss on the budget this year, which reversed surprisingly strong confidence in early 2013.' That is the world's foremost economist saying emphatically that the government's big miss on the budget this year has reversed surprisingly strong confidence that was in Australian community. </span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">The circus that is the modern Labor Party is never going to be able to lead whilst it does not know where it wants to go. The circus that is the modern Labor Party will never be trusted by the Australian people so long as they make the big, heroic promises that, at the end of the day, they just never deliver. </span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">In the past week, we have received more warnings from peak Australian business people about the lack of confidence of business and consumers. Why not? We have had yet again more leadership speculation. We are in the middle of another groundhog-day-like leadership show from the Labor Party. What are the Australian people going to do? Do you think they are going to cheer and go out there and spend money in shops, invest in businesses and take a risk employing more people? No, they are not. They are going to sit on their hands, hoping that one day stability and predictability will come back to Canberra. </span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Over the past 24 hours, we have had the Business Council of Australia president, Tony Shepherd, say, 'We are now seeing that the economy is not as great as it looked.' Is it the end of the world? No, it is not, but we will have significant structural adjustment issues in the coming years. They are ringing the bell. They are warning that if we do not move now to address some of the structural challenges, then we are going to have pain in future years. What does the Labor Party care? Most of them have given up. They do not care about future pain. They do not care about future challenges. They just care about their jobs; whether they have got a chance of holding their seats. They do not care about the country. Toll Holdings chairman, Ray Horsburgh, warned this week, 'There is a general reluctance to spend money. The days of easy money are gone and financing for projects and capital expenditure is getting tougher.' The head of Australian equity strategy research branch at Macquarie Bank, Tanya Branwhite, said: 'Politically, it is just a shambles. Corporate Australia has just come to a stop. There is zero confidence about where we're headed, and household Australia is much the same.' </span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I would have thought that the Treasurer would be concerned about those sorts of observations. Macquarie Bank, Nouriel Roubini, Toll Holdings, the president of the Business Council of Australia, Goldman Sachs and a number of others are warning—they are ringing the bells and flashing the lights—that there are challenges now and ahead. </span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">What does this government do? It talks about its own leadership problems. It speculates. It talks about whether the member for Griffith is coming back or not. I do not care, and the Australian people do not care. The Australian people care about their jobs, not the job of Julia Gillard or Kevin Rudd. The Australian people care about their destiny, not the destiny of Julia Gillard or Kevin Rudd. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The Australian people have had a gutful of the mess that is the modern Labor Party. They have had a gutful of the hubris of an incompetent government that is dividing the nation rather than uniting it; a government that cannot get the basics right, whether it comes to the nation's spiralling government debt, the carbon tax, the mining tax or asylum seeker management. In every single policy area that you can imagine, the Labor Party just gets it wrong. No wonder they cannot get their own leadership right. What a surprise. If they cannot get policy right, how are they going to get leadership right? Three years ago almost to the day, Prime Minister Gillard promised that she 'will lead a strong and responsible government that will take control of our future'. Labor's problems with debt show emphatically that the government does not have control of the future.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Labor did not trust themselves when they came to government so they introduced a debt cap of $75 billion, and they broke that. They said it was the GFC and they had to break that debt cap of $75 billion; they increased it to $200 billion. They said, 'Look, this is a financial crisis; we have had all this money ripped out and we have got to increase the debt cap to deal with it.' And they said, 'This will be the worst of it, don't worry'; $200 billion. But then, they kept spending. They kept spending money they did not have. They kept spending money on pink batts and school halls. Did you know that the Labor Party is still building 32 school halls today as part of the stimulus package of December 2008 and, of course, they were handing out $900 cheques to dead people. How does a dead person stimulate the economy? That is going to be a great trivia question some time in the future. What about all those pink batts? They spent billions of dollars putting pink batts into people's homes and then spent billions of dollars ripping them out. They might as well have painted rocks white for all that was worth. But the cost was deaths; deaths of young Australians putting those damn pink batts into people's homes—no apology from the Labor Party for that.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">But when it comes to debt, they were not satisfied with $200 billion and they said: 'Look, I'm sorry, we're going to have to increase it again. We have to go to $250 billion.' And in the next budget they said: 'Look, where has that money gone. I'm sorry, we are going to have to go further. We are going to have to go to $300 billion, but don't worry, we are never going to get above the $250 billion—ever. No, no, never! We will never go above $250 billion, but just in case.' And we said, 'Hang on, don't trust Labor.' They are like someone who cannot control their spending and keeps going back to the bank manager and saying, 'Look, can we increase my credit card limit from $5,000 to $40,000?' and then coming back for $50,000, and then the next week $70,000. The government are just the same—they do not live within their means. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">And what happens? Now it has been revealed in Senate estimates that in fact the debt cap of $300 billion just is not enough. At the end of this year, according to the last budget, they will get to $290 billion of government debt. But some time early next year, they will get over $300 billion and someone into the future will have to address that. As the Treasury said to Neil Mitchell at budget time, with his world-renowned courage—a courage which would have been most often found on that yellow brick road—'Someone else will have to worry about that' in reference to increasing the debt limit. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">There has been one consistent theme about the incompetence of the Rudd and Gillard governments; it is that Wayne Swan has been the Treasurer the whole way through. How about that? What a surprise. He has been the one consistent theme. He has been the one person who keeps making these big heroic promises. Of course, he joined the current Prime Minister in committing Labor to not having a carbon tax. He said on <span style="font-style:italic;">7.30</span><span style="font-style:italic;"></span>that it was absurd. He even suggested that it was typical of the Liberal Party to suggest that the Labor Party would introduce a carbon tax—and then they did. This man, who is brimful of courage, did not even have the courage to turn up at the press conference in the Prime Minister's courtyard and say we are introducing a new tax. He was cowering under his desk in the Treasurer's office. Normally, a Treasurer is there when you are introducing a new tax—but not when it comes to the carbon tax. But Monday next week he is the man who is going to deliver an increase in the carbon tax. It is going up five per cent next week to $24.15 per tonne. Gee, that has got to be good for Australia—$24.15 per tonne for carbon tax next week—given that New Zealand has a carbon tax of 75c per tonne. Given that the Europeans have a carbon tax of around $6 a tonne, you would think we would not want to be at a competitive disadvantage to those people. But no, the Labor Party somehow believes it is great for Australia to have a tax at a level that no-one else has and to implement it on energy, which flows right through to every aspect of the economy.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">How about that mining tax? What a cracker that was! Only Wayne Swann could introduce a tax that does not raise any money and bring down two prime ministers. Only he could do that. He is accomplished at this:  overpromising and under-delivering. It was a tax that was meant to raise $30 billion but ended up raising $3.3 billion. That is a cracker—to go through all that political pain of the mining tax and then have it raise no money. But the problem is that Labor spent what they thought they were going to get and they continue to borrow to make up that gap. They are borrowing from you, the Australian people; they are borrowing from our children. Somehow they think that is great governance. It is not.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Asylum seekers have now cost $10 billion. Kevin Rudd's  failure on asylum seeker boats has cost $10 billion. More tragically, 45,000 people have come on boats to Australia and it is averaging around three boats a day now. They are not reported everywhere, but that is the most obvious signature policy failure of this government. But it is always hard to tell.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">On regulation, they said they would deregulate. To their great credit they have abolished 1,000 regulations since they have been in the government. The problem is they have introduced 21,000 new regulations. No wonder red tape and green tape are killing the Australian economy. The list goes on.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The bottom line is this: the Labor Party does not know how to govern the country. The Labor Party does not know how to govern its own party. The Labor Party cares more about their own jobs than they care about the jobs of the Australian people. They care only about their own finances; they do not care about the finances of the families and small businesses of Australia. The sooner we have this election the better. The Australian people are crying out for a change of government.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Lindsay</span>—<span class="HPS-MinisterialTitles">Assistant Treasurer and Minister Assisting for Deregulation</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">16:12</span>):  It is always a pleasure to contribute to a matter of public importance such as this one. It is interesting that we end there with the member for North Sydney talking about jobs. Notice that he did not talk about that nearly one million jobs that have been created in the economy since this government has been in office. Almost a million jobs created, with an economy that is now 14 per cent larger than it was before the global financial crisis.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We must put that in some global context, given that we operate in a global economy and any comparison must be one that looks at what is happening out there across the globe. Across the globe, throughout that period, tens of millions of jobs have been lost in economies but here in the Australian economy almost a million jobs have been created. That is a result of the economic policies that have been put in place by this government over that period. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">There is always lots of discussion, with the benefit of hindsight, from those opposite and I note that the member for North Sydney quoted Nouriel Roubini. He said that Roubini is a very esteemed economist; certainly he is a well-regarded economist. I must make the point that he has been known by some under the name of 'Dr Doom', which I would have thought would be the very first sort of economist that would be cited by those opposite because they are talkers of doom at every opportunity. Throughout the last several years, when the Australian economy has outperformed every other major advanced economy, they have given no credit to the Australian economy; they have given no credit to the job creation policies of this government; but they now come into this place and point to an economist who has been noted for having predicted the global financial crisis. That is his principal claim to fame. They come in and quote that economist even though, for the last five years, they have been denying the existence of the global financial crisis.

                    <span class="HPS-MemberContinuation">Mr BRADBURY:</span>
                  </a>  Thank you very much for the interjection from the member for Berowra, who says: 'And they are still spending stimulus money!' He should have a look at the speech that his colleague, the member for North Sydney, gave just the other night, when he said 'The economy is tanking so badly that it will need another stimulus package.' If Joe Hockey, the member for North Sydney, believes that things are so dire that the economy needs a stimulus package, why was it that just a short time ago he was over on the other side of the world talking the politics of austerity? The politics of austerity means ripping funding away; it means less government expenditure and jacking up taxes. It is the height of hypocrisy when the member for North Sydney comes in here and says the worst thing you could do is introduce a big tax that will slow growth and hurt the economy. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Then he went on to say that the Treasurer was not there at the press conference when the carbon price was announced. I do not recall the member for North Sydney, as the shadow economics spokesman, having his name on the press release that announced the opposition's monster $20 billion paid parental leave tax. That is probably because he does not support the policy. The Leader of the Opposition says it is a signature policy—a policy that will give millionaires up to $75,000 in payments while they go off and have a child. Yet the Leader of the Opposition is the same bloke who, when he was in government, said he would only support a paid parental leave policy over his dead body. We had to climb over it, but as a government we have delivered a sensible, responsible and very fair system when it comes to paid parental leave. The minister at the table has been instrumental in delivering that. We do not talk about it; we have done it. It is just another one of the achievements of this government.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Members opposite talk about how dire the economy is. As I said, they have been through a period of denial. They have been denying that the global financial crisis existed. In fact, when we stepped up to the mark and we invested billions of dollars to stimulate the economy to keep the wheels of commerce in this country turning, they voted against it, or at least those that turned up in the chamber voted against it. We know that the Leader of the Opposition is someone who has been described by his former boss as someone who is economically illiterate and by his former colleague as someone who is bored by economics. So bored and so illiterate was he on this occasion that, when the biggest global economic crisis of a generation struck and our government was required to stand up and put in place policies to address that challenge, he did not even come into the chamber to vote on those important measures.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">So, whilst the member for Berowra and the member for Goldstein do not have a lot of credibility, they do have this degree of credibility: the credibility they have is that they can say that at least they voted against the stimulus package. The member for North Sydney is now saying we need another stimulus package, so I think his defence is a bit more complicated, but the two members sitting on the front bench opposite at least had the stomach to walk into this place to stand up for their convictions, which was to take a path which, frankly, would have been a job-destroying course of action for the Australian economy. Think of the hundreds of thousands of Australians who would have lost their jobs and been put on the scrap heap of unemployment. Think of the wasted skills. Think of the wasted human capital of those people turfed out onto the unemployment queue, because if those opposite had been in government they would not have stimulated the economy the way we have. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Right around the world people have looked at the stimulus measures this government put in place and they say we have delivered. Why do they say that? They say it because our economy is growing stronger than any other major advanced economy—14 per cent larger today than when we came to office. We have a AAA credit rating from all three major ratings agencies. Those opposite come in and they lecture us about the golden era of economic management under the Howard and Costello government. They call it the golden era. The next member on that side of the chamber who stands up should tell us when they achieved the AAA credit rating from all three ratings agencies. Which year was it? Let us start at 1996: was it 1996? Was it 1997? Was it 1998? Was it any year all the way through to 2007?</span>

In fact, it is an opportune moment to remind him that we have put in place a Parliamentary Budget Office so that those opposite can avoid the ignominy and the embarrassment of what they faced at the last election. This is where the member for Goldstein gets uncomfortable and starts to move around in his seat and look at his shoes. He has to accept personal responsibility for the costings debacle of the last election, where after the election his policies were costed by the Treasury and found to have an $11 billion black hole. I remember growing up and watching a program on television, <span style="font-style:italic;">The Six Million Dollar Man</span>. The member for Goldstein is the $11 billion man, and that is not a compliment. That is the size of the budget black hole that you left behind.</span>

                  </a>  I can understand why the member opposite does not want to talk about the economy. I will share with him some words of wisdom from someone who those opposite hail as being their great former leader, John Howard, the former member for Bennelong. John Howard does not have the same incentive to come up and mislead people in the way which those opposite do. In January this year he said: </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Small">When the Prime Minister and the Treasurer and others tell you that the Australian economy is doing better than most—they are right.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal"> </span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">So if you are not prepared to believe the government when it comes to economic management credentials then I ask you to have a look at some objective indicators. Have a look at the AAA credit rating from all three major ratings agencies: it was never delivered when the coalition were in office. Have a look at what the former Liberal Prime Minister, John Howard, had to say. He said:</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Small">We are still fortunate that we have an unemployment rate with a five in front of it. I wouldn't have thought that was going to be possible a few years ago, and I don't think many people would.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">When the member for North Sydney finished off his contribution by saying, 'All those opposite are interested in is their own jobs,' he should have acknowledged the point that his former leader acknowledged: that the jobs of hundreds and thousands of Australians have been secured and protected because of the action of this government. The member for North Sydney used the expression 'spiralling government debt'. What did the former Liberal Prime Minister John Howard have to say about this so-called spiralling government debt? He said: </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Small">And our debt to GDP ratio, the amount of money we owe to the strength of our economy, is still a lot better than most other countries.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I could rest my case on the words of John Howard. I could do that, but there are a couple of other important points I want to make. One is that those opposite talk about high-taxing governments. What they do not acknowledge is that the tax-to-GDP ratio under this government—that is, the amount of tax you collect as a proportion of the economy—is considerably lower today than it was when we came into office. It was 23.7 per cent when they left office. Today it is 21.5 per cent. To put that in context, one percentage point is equivalent to $15 billion a year. That means that, had we been taxing Australians at the same level as they were being taxed when we came into office, the budget would be in surplus today.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">A question that those opposite might want to answer at some point is: do they give a commitment to keep the tax-to-GDP ratio at the level that it is at? If that is the case, then they have got some work to do because of the very few policies they have been prepared to share with us. The first one is their $20 billion paid parental leave tax, which will slug 3,000 of the most successful businesses operating in this country. They will do that—</span>
              </p>

                  </a>  and I do not think the member for Goldstein believes in the paid parental leave tax, either. I think he was a dissenting voice in the shadow cabinet. Sorry, I forgot: this matter did not go to the shadow cabinet. This was one of those unilateral signature policies that the Leader of the Opposition decided he would implement. Then, if I recall correctly, when he took it to the party room he said, 'Sometimes it's better to ask for forgiveness than permission.' This is one occasion when he was asking for forgiveness. But I tell you: it is not the member for Goldstein he needs to forgive or needs to seek forgiveness from. He needs to seek forgiveness not just from the 3,000 successful Australian businesses that will be slugged with this tax but from the Australian people, who will face an increase in the cost of their goods and services when they go to the grocery store and in their mortgages. The banks have already indicated that they would need to increase mortgage rates to fund this paid parental leave tax. People will pay for it at the bowser, as the price of petrol goes up when petrol companies are slugged with this tax. And this will be a tax on miners as well, as much as the coalition might like to tell their friends in the mining sector that they will be a protected species under them.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The point is that, as a government, we have delivered sensible tax reforms that have delivered tax cuts to an overwhelming majority of Australians while, at the same time, we have committed to shoring up the tax base.  Members would be aware that I have been talking a lot over time about the need to crack down on multinational taxation loopholes. Those opposite have voted against every measure we have put in place. Last night they did it again, with the changes to part IVA, the general anti-avoidance and transfer pricing provisions. They voted against it in the Senate. What I found extraordinary was that, at the very same time, the member for North Sydney was out there finally acknowledging what we have been saying, that there are problems with corporate tax loopholes:</span>

                <span class="HPS-Small">The problem is that national taxation laws were essentially designed to cover domestically operating entities and while there have been amendments to account for cross-border activity, these additions have not been able to fully keep up.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">He said we need to bring global tax rules into the 21st century. If he is fair dinkum then, when we bring in a proposal to do that, you should support it. That is not what you have been prepared to do, because you always stand up for lurks for corporate tax. <span style="font-style:italic;">(Time expired)</span></span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Goldstein</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">16:27</span>):  It is like <span style="font-style:italic;">Groundhog Day</span>! I must have followed the member for Lindsay, the Assistant Treasurer, on at least five or six occasions this year where we gave the government the opportunity to defend their economic performance, their economic policies and the structure and the strategy of their budget. We have given them an opportunity on so many occasions and, on every occasion I have had the opportunity to follow the Assistant Treasurer, I will say one thing for him: I think he has been very consistent. He is consistent in his inability to defend this government's economic performance. All we ever hear is a litany of personal attacks. We get a litany of make-ups about things that he thinks we will do, that we would do or that he would like us to do. What we saw again today was another symbol of the incompetence that this economy has had to endure for three years under this Prime Minister and for six years under the two prime ministers on the Labor side.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">This debate is about the adverse impacts of the government's economic policies on confidence and the budget. The Assistant Treasurer did not spend one minute—not even 30 seconds—defending their performance. It was another pathetic performance. It was ill-informed, he made no points, he made personal attacks and it demonstrated once again the division, the bile, the poison and the disarray on the other side. That is why the economy is in its current form and why there is no confidence in the community. It is why the government bragged about saving rates being at 10 per cent today. The reason that saving rates are at 10 per cent is that people are scared to spend any money or to make any investment. They are paying off their mortgages as fast as they can; they are paying off the plastic. They are being spooked into saving. And today the Treasurer stands over there and claims a victory by claiming that he has helped Australians save more money. He has spooked them into it. He has them so frightened about their job prospects and the prospects of a reliable income that they are saving as they never have before. This is the disarray we see over there. They see the disarray. </span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">This government are a government beholden to the Greens one day, the Independents the next day and the union movement the day after, and occasionally they try to get in something of their own volition. No wonder people are spooked. No wonder investors have put money back into the bottom drawer. They are not investing, because there is no confidence. They have seen this government heading in a whole series of different directions every day for years now.

                <span class="HPS-Normal">It is quite ironic that for nearly 2½ years now we have been hearing the same defence from this government. We have heard it from the Treasurer in particular and we heard it again today. The government say that they have the big calls right. How often do we hear this—that they have the big calls right? People might be waking up at 2.30 in the morning worrying about their job prospects and how they are going to pay the mortgage and all the rest of it, but the government have the big calls right! What are these so-called big calls? What are the things you would look back on over this term of office that you would say are big calls? The ones that they take great pride in are, firstly, the stimulus—the $87 billion of stimulus money—and, secondly, the fact that for years they have lectured us about the fact that they were going to deliver a surplus. These were the big calls: a stimulus and a surplus. Let me say to my colleagues and to those in the gallery: the stimulus is not something to be proud of. The stimulus did not save jobs in this country. The stimulus has been at the root of the massive debt that we now have. It is at the root of the lack of confidence in this economy. It is at the root of the structural deficits that we are confronting as an economy. It is at the root of the waste from the mining boom over the last few years. Here we are blessed like no other developed country with the opportunities we have from China. We never hear the other side talk about China. You would think that over the last few years with the highest terms of trade—</span>

                  </a>  Now they are laughing. People and families are worried sick and they are laughing. It is a great joke. The stimulus came in too big and too late. The Reserve Bank reduced interest rates by 4¼ per cent. It put tens of thousands of dollars into people's pockets, as it should have. Also, we saw the Australian dollar drop to US60c in the first quarter of 2009. Those opposite never refer to these sorts of developments.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We saw the biggest trade surplus in the country's history three months after the global financial crisis. We saw the biggest drop in interest rates in such a short time in our history. By the time the government passed the $87 billion stimulus package in that May budget—and most of it was spent not that year but two or three years later—Australia was coming out of it. Why? It was because of those two automatic stabilisers and because this government inherited an economy which was in the best shape of any economy in the world. They went into this without any debt. The rest of the world was wallowing in hundreds of billions of dollars of debt. In Australia, we had $70 billion in the bank—no debt federally and no debt at a state level. There was a ratio of zero debt to GDP. Now we have 11 per cent national debt and 11 per cent state debt. We have a 22 per cent debt-to-GDP ratio and we have the fastest growing debt in Australia's history. That is why we are vulnerable. That is why people are waking up at 2.30 anxious about their jobs. That is why people are saving at 10 per cent when historically they were saving at one or two per cent. People are frightened and business is nervous. Business is not prepared to make decisions or to create jobs.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">The government inherited a four per cent unemployment rate—unheard of in history. They inherited all these things and that is how we got through the global financial crisis. What happened nine months after the global financial crisis? This government started to spend like drunken sailors. They said it saved jobs. Why did the Reserve Bank increase interest rates while the government was increasing government expenditure? The Reserve Bank was trying to cool down the economy. That is what they were doing. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">This government was inappropriately fuelling the economy with massive doses of wasteful spending. It was not even good spending. It was not cutting the costs for business and helping to preserve jobs. It was spent on pink batts and school halls that cost double the price they should have and in many cases were not needed. It was spent on ridiculous things like paying dead people $900. This is the incompetence of those opposite and that is why people have lost confidence in them. </span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Now we see that at seven o'clock tonight there will be a ballot. That is what they are all concerned about—a ballot at seven o'clock tonight to see who is running this country. For God's sake, this is unacceptable. This government are so incompetent. Here we are, a month or two from an election—we will not know until seven o'clock tonight whether we are one month or two months from an election, I suspect. But here we are, with this  government have been so consumed with themselves over the last few months rather than the major issues: the structural deficits, the fall off in commodity prices, the threat to jobs and the fact that mining is coming off yet the rest of the economy is not picking up in response. These are the things that are worrying people. These are things that this government are not focusing on. </span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We have an agenda. We will get rid of the carbon tax. We will get the budget back in the black. We will stop the boats. With that agenda, we have a plan for the future. If this government is re-elected, it is a recipe for more and more incompetence and a greater lack of confidence and concern within the community. We need an election and we need it now.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Fraser</span>—<span class="HPS-MinisterialTitles">Parliamentary Secretary to the Prime Minister</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">16:37</span>):  We really should not be surprised that the opposition is continuing this line of attack. For the past three years this has been their standard tactic to avoid engaging in any substantive policy debate. They hurl accusations at the government to whip up fear based on factual inaccuracies. In talking about the government's economic policies on confidence and the budget, the member for North Sydney appears to be completely oblivious to the economic reality in Australia. That is because the economic reality is an uncomfortable one for the opposition because it so clearly reflects the economic policy successes of the Labor government.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">There is no clearer example of a successful economic policy than this government's carbon pricing scheme, and it is good to see the member for Wentworth at the table as I say that. Not only has the sky not fallen in since the scheme was introduced, but also we are now seeing early stages of its success. Every day it is becoming clearer that the carbon price has been the most sensible way to address climate change. Many of those opposite know in their heart of hearts, and indeed their own leader has said, that if you want to address climate change why not do it with a simple tax? Every day it is becoming clearer how effective this economic policy of pricing carbon is in addressing the challenge of climate change. Since its introduction the carbon price has resulted in a 7.4 per cent drop in emissions in the national electricity market. That is almost 12 million tonnes less pollution from the electricity sector. Renewable energy generation is rising by almost 30 per cent. This is not a change in consumption, as those opposite would have you believe. We can contrast carbon intensity. So in 2011-12, for every megawatt hour of electricity generated in the national electricity market, 0.92 tonnes of carbon pollution were released into the atmosphere. Since the price's introduction, the amount of pollution for every megawatt hour has gone down to 0.87 tonnes—a five per cent decline in emissions intensity in just a matter of months.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The carbon price has also had a lower impact on the cost of living than was expected. Those on this side of the House always said the impact of the carbon price on the cost of living would be moderate. It was projected at 0.7 per cent increase in the CPI, less than a third of the impact of the GST. But we now see new evidence that the impact of the carbon price on prices has been less than that.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Those opposite are well aware that Australia is the fourth-largest economy in the world—up from being 15th largest when this government came to power. We are the 15th largest polluter in the world—that is, if you look at more than 190 nations, Australia is the 15th largest polluter. Per capita, we are the largest polluter in the world. So this gives us a great responsibility to act to tackle climate change. Climate change is not someone else's problem. It is Australia's. At no time is that better illustrated than in January this year. January 2013 was the hottest month on record in Australia since 1910. It should have left no doubt in the mind of any Australian, including the climate sceptics opposite, that climate change is real, that it is happening now and that we need to act.</span>

                  </a>  If those opposite had the same view on climate change as the member for Wentworth did then my suggestions would be quite unjust. But, when climate change is raised, it is from that corner of the House that we hear the greatest cries. We refer to 'dangerous climate change' and it is as though a set of crackers had gone off in the seats on that part of the House. We have a fixed price in our emissions trading scheme which will conclude in June 2015. From then the carbon permits can be auctioned and traded allowing the market to determine the carbon price. That will ensure that emissions are reduced in the cheapest and most effective way.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">In July 2015 there will be an annual cap on the number of permits, which means there will be a cap on pollution. The current low market prices we are seeing in the European emissions trading system, to which we will link in 2015, does not detract from the environmental integrity of our pollution cap. Sound economic policy, sound social policy, sound environmental policy—that is this government's economic legacy.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The Leader of the Opposition has claimed that the carbon price would destroy thousands of jobs, that it would wipe Whyalla off the map. The reality is that since the price started employment has grown by more than 150,000 with the total number of jobs gained since Labor came to office now close to one million, at a time when unemployment has grown by 28 million worldwide. The latest consumer price index figures show the inflation rate was 2.5 per cent in the year to March—in the middle of the Reserve Bank's target zone for inflation. Westpac's economics team has estimated that the carbon price has increased the CPI by just 0.4 percentage points, less than Treasury's estimate of 0.7 percentage points.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The member for North Sydney, the Leader of the Opposition and the member for Wentworth know this, but it is a measure of the opportunism of the opposition that they choose to ignore it. The Australian Industry Group has '…long argued that an emissions trading scheme is the most flexible path to reducing greenhouse gas emissions at least cost'. Lord Stern, possibly the greatest world authority on the economics of tackling climate change, wrote a letter to the member for Lyne, which he has given me permission to quote in this place. That letter of 11 June 2012 recognises the benefits of Australia's carbon pricing scheme. Lord Nicholas Stern says:</span>

                <span class="HPS-Small">A clear, credible and stable climate change policy regime represents a unique opportunity for Australia: it could drive a new energy-industrial revolution, similar to past waves of innovation and technical change, such as the continuing ICT revolution. There is great potential for new products, processes and technologies to be developed across the economy and society. This fits well with Australia's entrepreneurial culture. Indeed, it fits well with Australia's long tradition of innovation and culture of creativity. Institutions such as the CSIRO are already making strong progress.</span>

Nominally a communist country, it saw a pilot emissions trading scheme launched on 18 June in Shenzhen. Pilots in Beijing, Tianjin, Shanghai, Hubei and Guangdong are expected to be launched this year. There is a deep irony in that the Liberal and National parties, which are nominally parties of the free market, are standing against the use of a market-based mechanism to deal with climate change, while nominally communist China is supporting a market-based mechanism. Of course they are doing so for a very simple reason: it is the most efficient way of dealing with dangerous climate change.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">New England</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">16:47</span>):  I rise to make my final contribution to this parliament and do so in the presence of family and friends in the gallery and, in the main, friends within the chamber as well. There are a few things I would like to say. I do not have a written speech but there are a number of things that I would like to comment on.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Firstly I would like to thank my staff. I think most of us—all of us—know the work that our staff do. It is a job description that is indescribable and something you really cannot just pull off the shelf and put in place. I will go through the list of people who are on my staff. Leigh Tschirpig—who is a male—has been with me for 22 years, since the day that I started. I thank you<span style="font-style:italic;"></span>Leigh; I presume you are listening. Sue O'Halloran<span style="font-style:italic;">, </span>who started with me and has done part-time work over the years, has also been in the office or out of it from time to time for 22 years. My industrial relations record is not very good in terms of getting rid of people; they seem to want to stay. Melissa Penrose—and Melissa<span style="font-style:italic;"></span>is in the gallery; she is in the Tony Abbott blue—has kept me organised for 18 years. I thank all of the members of my staff, obviously, but I thank you, Melissa, for your contribution. Graham<span style="font-style:italic;"></span>Nuttall<span style="font-style:italic;">—</span>who is no relation to Gordon, the Queensland person—has been with us; he has been sentenced to 14 years. Thank you, Graham,<span style="font-style:italic;"></span>for all your efforts and the fun we have had. Sandy York used to work for Senator Sandy Macdonald until I was elected into the federal parliament, I do not think Sandy will mind me telling the story. She was summoned on the Sunday after the Saturday and dismissed, the reason being that she was not political enough. I think that is exactly what we need in our electorate offices: people who are not political to service the community. So Senator Macdonald's loss was my gain. Sandy has been there 11 years. Bruce Clarke at Inverell, who was a cameraman here for some time with Channel 10, has been with us for five years. John Clements, who is sitting next to Graham over there, probably annoyed a few people, Minister! 'Constructively debated with people' would be the correct way of putting it, I think, John. Thank you very much. Particularly during a hung parliament everybody has worked extremely hard in a policy sense. Your contribution has been enormous and I appreciate it. Andra Milne has been on and off, working casually for four years, and Marcia Stapleton has also been there for four years. I would recognise a lady who worked with me in the original hung parliament and was employed because of a hung parliament, Angela Day, who has not been with me during my federal days.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I would also like to thank the Clerks. I am pleased Bernard and David are here, because they have been an extraordinary influence on me, and I am sure on all of us, in the way in which they are totally confidential—totally. It is an incredible trust that all of us have in relation to the way your office works, and I have appreciated that and I am sure many others have as well. Thank you. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">To all of the attendants, to the security guys, the Comcar people: we have a unique place here. One of the unique things in this building, and I suspect, from having been in another building, the New South Wales parliament, for 10 years prior to this, and Minister Burke may well agree—Jay, I forgot you. I am terribly sorry, Jay. I have heard of Sid Sidebottom for Treasurer! No such luck! Thank you, Jay. Jay has been with us during the hung parliament and we have had an extraordinarily interesting time of it. To go back to where I was: Comcar drivers are great people. One of the things that this building still has—and I think Minister Burke and the member for Lyne might recognise this, having been in the New South Wales parliament—is that it is a real honour to be here, not just for us but for the people who work in the building. New South Wales used to have that, and I am not condemning the people there now. But one of the things it has lost is that real spirit. It was driven by cost-cutting, in a sense: tendering out this, tendering out that. That took away a lot of the atmosphere and the real feeling in the building. One comment I would like to make is: whoever is in government, whoever is a member of parliament, do not lose that, because it is very precious. It is a real pleasure to be in this building, to come here of a morning and to see the mix of people like the ladies who clean the Prime Minister's office—I run into them in the lift. You know who they are, and when the US President was here he made a beeline for them. They are extraordinary people that do an enormous amount of devoted work for us. We should all show our appreciation more often and make sure that we preserve that. If it costs a few extra dollars, I would vote for it, because it really adds value to the parliament.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">To all of the attendants that service us in the building: thank you very much. The courtesy that you have shown over the years is extraordinary and greatly appreciated. To the people in Aussies—we are having a bit of a contest on the football tonight—what a great family of good people who work there and serve good coffee. We have breakfast there every morning, two bits of toast and two poached eggs. Dom still gives me that bit of green stuff that you have to throw away—he just will not listen! I have demanded that Tony censure him, and he does not seem to do that either. Thank you to all of those people.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">To the committees that I have been on, the Standing Committee on Regional Australia and the Standing Committee on Agriculture, Resources, Fisheries and Forestry, which I was on in the previous parliament: thank you to all of the committee secretariat and the people who have worked there. We have done some extraordinarily good things, particularly in this parliament: the Murray-Darling; the fly-in fly-out arrangements. The work of these committees impacts on the debate that is currently before the parliament: 457 visas at the moment. The issue is a much bigger one than that. It is about the effect of mobile workforces on stand-alone communities. This is something that policy has to address. The fly-in fly-out issue, 457 visas, work camps in communities all have not only an impact on the employer and the employee and, to some degree, the union movement and others but also a real potential impact on the towns themselves. For all of these issues—and I am not arguing against 457s—we have to make sure that locality is important.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I thank Simon Crean, the first Minister for Regional Australia, Regional Development and Local Government, for the work of the regional Australia committee. I thank the Regional Australia Institute, Sue McCluskey and others doing valuable work. I thank you, Simon, for the work that we have done together as a group. It has been a pleasure working with you. From both sides of parliament, I think you are the one person who really does get regional development. It is so easy to politicise it, but you are in touch with it. That is very important, and I thank you for that.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">To my colleague 'Buckshot': thank you. You are an extraordinary individual that I knew in the New South Wales parliament. In fact, he spoke against me one day, and I have never forgotten it! This is the moment of retribution! I really admire Rob for the work that he has done. He has taken this parliament seriously. It is not an easy parliament for anybody, and in a lot of ways a lot of very negative strategy has been used. But I think, Rob, you deserve the plaudits of the House and the community, because you have stuck to your guns, you have worked hard, and you have absorbed the vitriol of idiots like Ray Hadley and Alan Jones. You have done an extraordinary job, and it has been a real pleasure to work with you. We have had fun at various staff dinners and whatever. It has been really great. To your wife and family, particularly the Canterbury supporter: I wish you well and hopefully we can maintain contact into the future.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">To the Prime Minister: I thank you. At the beginning of this process the Australian people had a nil-all draw or a fifty-fifty split, and we were asked to make a determination in relation to that. I had been involved in a hung parliament previously, in 1991. There was a 99-seat parliament and Nick Greiner and the Liberal-National Party had 49. They needed 50 to get there, and it was my vote that gave them the 50 and allowed Nick Greiner to form government. I saw the vagaries of a hung parliament, particularly with Nick Greiner, for whom I still have a great deal of respect, and the way it chewed him up in terms of the internal machinations going on within his party—the Liberal Party group, as it was known back then; Malcolm would know them, and there are still some of them around. Nick Greiner ended up resigning.</span>
              </p>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">I remember Nick Greiner ringing me one night after the ICAC had found him guilty of corruption. He rang me on the Sunday night and said, 'Tony, I'm going to resign tomorrow.' I said to him: 'Nick, you have not exhausted the processes of the law. You have the right of appeal on these things.' He said: 'It doesn't matter; my mob have turned against me. I am resigning tomorrow.' I will always remember that he said to me—and you will appreciate this, Michael and Mark—'You know, Tony, the Nats were the ones who stuck with me.' Nick Greiner resigned, and 10 days later he was found not guilty on appeal. Among the complete badgering that has gone on in this place in relation to Peter Slipper and Craig Thomson, when they have not fulfilled due process, I kept reflecting back to those days with Nick Greiner. All of us, irrespective of whether we are believed to be saints or sinners, and particularly in this place, should expect due process to take place. So I thank Nick Greiner.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">I thank you, Prime Minister, because with that experience behind us the 17 days—and then the 17 minutes—was a very interesting time. I thought it was a valuable time. People have to bear in mind that at that time the election result had not even been called. Everybody thought—and Bob will remember a lot of this—that it was going to be a hung parliament, but not necessarily until the numbers were added up. During that period we negotiated with Tony Abbott and his team and with Julia Gillard and Wayne Swan and their people, and all of those negotiations were in good faith. It was not an easy decision to make, but we picked the right person, and I congratulate you for the way you have been able to withstand the vagaries of the hung parliament and the negative vibes that have been developed out in the community. In some ways they do not fully comprehend what a hung parliament is, and still look at it through the prism of the two-party system. It is not that. The prosecution of the various cases in here has been about the two parties—the issue of the so-called carbon tax lie, for instance.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I would have presumed, and I said this morning, that anybody in the major parties running for an election would assume that they would get a majority, and in the Labor Party's case, if they had gained a majority, they may well have moved to an ETS fairly quickly. But—I think Malcolm would agree with this, and I know former Prime Minister Howard had a similar process—to get your institutional framework in place for an emissions trading scheme you need to have a fixed price for a certain period. A fixed price in economic terms is a tax.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">One of the issues I am proudest to be involved in is the climate change issue. I think it is absolutely disgraceful that we have picked that as a target. Here again, today in our parliament, we are still on about this problem. As a farmer I know that if we suffer climatic change that is detrimental—not necessarily less rain, but maybe more intense rainfall and longer dry periods—that has an incredible impact on our economy. Anybody who is trying to assess risk in any shape or form would have to look very seriously at the science and try to do something about it. And if you are going to try to do something about it then, regrettably, there is no cheaper way of doing it than putting a price on it. We can have our arguments about the global linkages et cetera, what all that means later on and what the fixed price is now. I know a little bit more about that which I will not be saying here. But I applaud the Prime Minister for doing it—for actually doing it, rather than just talking about it. I think the multiparty climate change process worked. Everybody did not get their own way, but it was a process where, in a minority government, you have to deal with others, and that process was conducted very well.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The other issue that I would raise in relation to the Prime Minister is that there has never been an occasion where I have felt—and I think I speak for Rob as well—that you have attempted to welsh on any deals. You have been very supportive of the initiatives that are out there. We knew you would be a good negotiator in terms of those issues. I respect the way that you and your staff—Jo Haylen and Cate Harrison, who we have had a lot of contact with, and all of your staff—have respected and regarded us and have not seen us as 'those interlopers' who come in from time to time.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">So I do congratulate you on the way in which this difficult period has been negotiated. I will not get into the names, but I do not think anybody else could have done it. I do not think anyone else could have done it at a federal level. The community make decisions about future parliaments, and so they should, but I want to put on record my respect and regard for the Prime Minister—and you, too, Wayne—for the way in which our dealings have worked right through the process.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">To Minister Burke: well done on the Murray-Darling. I think that was extraordinary. There was a problem for 100 years and through majorities and minorities—whoever—no-one would address that issue. That has happened in a hung parliament. At the start of this, a lot of people said, 'Nothing will happen; there will be a paralysis,' but a lot has happened. There have been significant issues—the Murray-Darling being one of them. The National Broadband Network will be extraordinary for regional Australia—and here we are having a debate on why it is bad! We can get into the business case and the cost-benefit analysis and all of that, but if we do anything short of that—and I am not being critical of you, Malcolm; I have great regard and respect for you—long term it will be insufficient and we will end up on a road that has blockages in it.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">There have been other significant issues. I mentioned the climate change debate. We have the National Disability Insurance Scheme. Well done, Jenny, I think that is extraordinary—and to Bill Shorten, too, who raised that some years ago. I remember talking to Bill over here and he asked me: 'What are your views on this sort of stuff, Tony?' That was back in the previous government. A lot of people from both sides of the House have been very strong about trying to do something about those less fortunate than ourselves.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We have the so-called 'water trigger'. Thank you again, Prime Minister. I recognise that it probably did cause some consternation with a few, but it is the right thing to do. Objective science in terms of assessing groundwater systems is absolutely critical to some of these groundwater systems, whether they be extractive activities or other activities. I think we really need to have a very close look and get it right, particularly where water is concerned; otherwise the mistakes can be quite dramatic—because, as we all know, water runs down hill.</span>

                  </a>  Not everyone? Michael? You're in tin-hat corner! Simon, the regional Australia program is appreciated by regional Australians. I know that and I thank you for that and also for the work that you did in terms of the Murray-Darling and other regional issues.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Two of the things that I am proudest of, though, that came out of the arrangement in terms of the formation of government are the Health and Hospitals Fund and the Education Investment Fund. Both the Prime Minister and the Leader of the Opposition admitted during that 17-day period that regional Australia had essentially been ignored—to some degree; I am not saying totally. We argued that there could be a way of rectifying this, and 100 per cent of those two funds went to country areas. We have been criticised that this was all about pork-barrelling our particular seats, but nearly $2 billion came out of the Health and Hospitals Fund when you add some of the cancer clinics to it as well when there was a regional round. Nicola and Tanya, thank you for the work that you have done. Thanks also goes to Tony Abbott for the work that you did previously in terms of the university department of rural health, which led quite quickly to the University of New England developing a medical school. And there is a whole range of other things that are add-ons to that which go to the issue of country health. Those two funds were 100 per cent ring-fenced for country people. One hospital in my electorate got some money, 134 somewhere else got some money, and there are similar statistics in relation to the university and TAFE funding.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I thank the electorate for tolerating me and for the support that I have had over many, many years. I have been in parliament for 22 years now. I have been in two hung parliaments—and one with Bob Carr that had a majority of one; so that was virtually a hung parliament. So for 50 per cent of the time I have been an Independent in a so-called unique position. I have appreciated every one of those parliaments, both state and federal. But I think therein lies a message: if one individual can be in a balance of power situation, or very close to it, for 50 per cent of his political life, what can 30 per cent of the nation do in terms of country Australia? Country Australians really have a problem in a sense in that they think because they represent only 30 per cent of the population they have to accept through the democratic processes what the other 70 per cent bestow upon them.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">But one needs to actually analyse the numbers. The reason that western Sydney, western Melbourne and Brisbane are important in most elections is that that is where the marginal seats are, and they normally determine the outcome. But if you analyse back to Federation, there has not been a parliament since Federation where a country member of that parliament has not held the balance of power. It is just that they have been married into city based, majority, democratically trading political parties—whether they be the Labor Party, the Liberal Party or the National Party.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">One of the legacies of this parliament, I hope, is that country people actually look at this in a more strategic sense. You see the Greens—and I thank Adam for being here—with seven or eight per cent of the vote having significant influence, particularly in the Senate. Country people have got to be a bit more strategic about this. I take my hat off to the Western Australian National Party and Brendon Grylls in particular—he has had a similar strategy. In our political history, the two major management teams, not political parties, as I see them, are very similar and they create differences—a fight over climate change, for instance; a created difference; something to create the division, the divide. I think Brendon Grylls was in a hung parliament situation and, genuinely, looked at both sides rather than just heading for one. If you head for one, you will be taken for granted by both. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I thank you, Tony, for your attendance in this parliament. For the life of me—I know I have been critical of you—I just could not understand after what Brendon had done over there that you would come into this parliament and then join up with the minority group and not take advantage of the hung parliament for your people. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">In the electorate there are a lot of things I am proud of, but what I am proudest of is where the people have driven things. In lots of cases they are the smaller things. Tingha, which is an Aboriginal community that has produced some great footballers over the years, had an old hospital. We have all seen it. It was to be pulled down, and they could travel somewhere else. There was another town somewhere else they could go to. They were not on the MPS list. I will never forget—he is still a bureaucrat down here—the night we had the meeting in the Tingha hall. I rang Lyall Munroe, who is not in the electorate but Peter Garrett would know him.</span>

Can you come across to Tingha?' <span style="&#xD;&#xA;    font-family:Tahoma;&#xD;&#xA;  ">'</span>Yeah, mate, I'll be there.' We walked in with this bureaucrat—he was coming to tell them that they could not have an MPS because they were not on the list. This was not in the hung parliament; this is back in the Howard days. As we walked in the door, there were 500 people and I said, <span style="&#xD;&#xA;    font-family:Tahoma;&#xD;&#xA;  ">'</span>I look forward to listening to you tell them.<span style="&#xD;&#xA;    font-family:Tahoma;&#xD;&#xA;  ">'</span> Anyway, they have a beautiful MPS, and that is community at work.

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Probably one of the most pleasing activities that I have been involved in was the saving of the Bundarra Grace Munro aged-care facility. Grace Munro was the founder of the CWA and lived in the Bundarra area. Ten beds—is Justine Elliot here; no—are uneconomic, apparently. The provider from Inverell said: <span style="&#xD;&#xA;    font-family:Tahoma;&#xD;&#xA;  ">'</span>We don't want to do it any more. They can all come to Inverell.' A little committee was formed. I was part of that, and we went through all the ramifications of what would happen, how we could make it economic. The departmental people, who were playing the departmental card at the start, became sympathetic. The minister, who was Justine Elliot, the member for Richmond, had a good look at it and the community found some money. A lot of people made a contribution to get it going and, since then—that is about five or six years ago now—it has made a profit every year. So don't let anybody tell you that 10 beds is too small and that you have to go to the next biggest feedlot to get service. That is not correct. Small communities can do enormous things if they get together . </span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Other things—there is a whole list, but I will mention a few. Chaffey Dam—Mike, you would be aware of that—and Barraba pipeline. In fact, if you had not been involved, and Minister Burke again, I do not think Barraba would have a pipeline today, and they have got about 10 kays to go. The financial contribution from the Commonwealth government essentially gave a lifeline to a small town for a very basic utility: water. Tamworth Base Hospital—there is an enormous expenditure package going on there. The University of New England has received quite large grants, particularly for agricultural research and agricultural extension. I would like to mention a fellow called Victor Minichiello, who has done an enormous amount of work in the medical school at the university and has good ideas. He is actually dealing with the Argentinians at the moment to try and create some relationships between our countries. </span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I am getting there; I do apologise. I remember one day, Prime Minister, you and I were here—it was in the paper quite recently again—and Greg Combet. I congratulate Greg for the work that he has done, an absolute believer in the climate change initiative. One of the things the Prime Minister would be aware of—and Greg, in particular—is that the abattoir at Inverell is going to be an extraordinary example that reverses all of the nonsense that we have heard. The unit cost of production will actually go down. Utility prices, whether it be gas, heat or electricity, will be controlled within an almost closed loop. The very thing that we are talking about: renewable energy, value-adding to agriculture—all of the stuff—and that is why you have not heard anything from the meat-processing industry. The smart money has moved. It is not only good for the climate, it is also good business, and they are doing that. There is nothing of the magnitude of the Bindaree Beef proposal at Inverell. And when it is up and going it will not only lead the game here, it will lead it internationally too in terms of closed loop systems and value adding to agriculture.</span>

I have great regard—that is right, you and I were standing here and Greg Combet came along—he was quite rude, actually; he looked at what we were looking at. He thought it was a valuable document. Anyway, it was a cartoon from First Dog on the Moon. He does a great cartoon of you, and others. I was showing you this, and the next day in the <span style="font-style:italic;">Telegraph</span>, in the editorial, there was something about this learned discussion going on.

                <span class="HPS-Normal">I do have to reflect, just for a moment, on couple of things. Alby Schultz made a comment the other day about how, on the agriculture committee, there was a stacked deck with Martin Ferguson, myself and others and where, in a majority government, the Prime Minister's choice did not get up back in the Howard days. It was lovely to listen to Alby—well, firstly, it was good to see Alby back in the House, but it was also lovely to listen to him tell that story. I think it said a lot of things not just about Alby, but also about people on committees and how they get on together. In this case they stacked the meeting. The Prime Minister's choice went down seven to two—Alby had that bit wrong—and I had the great privilege of moving the motion that Alby be the chair. The poor old committee secretariat, they did not know how to handle it at all.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The other little bit of humour I would like to remember is the first time I met Bob Katter. I was in the New South Wales parliament and Bob, in his very quiet way, was berating everybody who moved, and particularly the National Party. I thought, 'That man's got some intelligence.' He was threatening to become an Independent. I thought: 'I'll go and see this bloke. I think he's just full of wind. I hear him threatening things and he doesn't follow through.' So off to Canberra—Grahame was with me when I came down. We found Bob's office, shook hands and went into his inner office and sat down. Bob gets up again, goes over to his cupboard and gets out a rope. He took this rope out of his cupboard and started—the office had those very big pot plants. He started wrapping the rope around the doorhandle and round and round this big pot plant. I was fearful for a while, but then I said, 'What are you doing that for?'</span>

So as soon as all this concoction was put in place, one of his staff said, 'Bob! Bob!' And Bob—round and round the pot plant—said, 'What do you want?' It was some menial task. Anyway, I remember that moment very, very fondly. I pay my regards to John Forrest too: one of the real Christians in this parliament, not only in his beliefs but also in the way he practises them.

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I am sorry to have held the House for so long. In conclusion, I had, obviously, supporters right across the electorate. Supporters are critical to all of us. I have in the chamber today Stephen and Helen Hall, who have been with me right from the start. Peter Wakeford is not here; he has been my patron. Les Dow is here, and thanks, Les, I really respect our friendship and your involvement. Peter Pulley, who is in Tamworth. Helen Tickle, Wally Franklin, Andrew Fuller from Inverell, Grahame Marriott also from Inverell, and Terry Doherty. And there are many, many others who are out there who have been incredibly supportive over the years.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">This is where it now gets rough, I suppose. To my family, to my wife, Lyn, who I was in kindergarten with—probably time to move on! I am protected by privilege! Thank you for all of the work you have put into this job as well. I apologise for some of the vitriol that you were exposed to at the start of this parliament. That is our job, not our family's. We will spend a bit more time picking up sticks than we have in the past, and you'll have to do your share too! Thank you for everything you have done for our family.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Kate, who is sitting next to Lyn, is here. Thanks, 'Nut', for all your work. I will not tell them how old you are now, but you were seven when I first went into parliament. Kate is getting married to Andy later in the year. Our elder son, Andrew, who is 31, is running the farms and doing an extraordinary job. That is one of the things I want to do: go and spend a bit of time annoying him and maybe tidying up a few little sticks here and there. He is getting married to Hannah later in the year, and we have a little granddaughter, Matilda, as well. Tom, who is 21, has never known me as anything other than a politician. I will take him to Africa to have a look at the animals.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">If anybody has shown a lead for me, it has my mother, who is still alive. She is nearly 96 and very good of mind. My mother-in-law, Betty Cross, has been extraordinary as well. My mother lost her husband when I was eight. Her capacity to withstand hardship and operate a farm business at a time when, because of intestate issues, the capacity to borrow on an asset was not available until the youngest son turned 21, is a great credit to her tenacity and also to my father, who had been killed in a tractor accident. She is still very strong of mind and she is aware of what is happening.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I think we all learn from our parents, and one thing that I learnt as a child from my mother was that all people are the same. There was no racial or religious talk or chatter in our house about the 'station' of people. It was not until I got to university that I started to recognise that some people thought they were better than others. I think in the political process we really need to home in on that. Everybody deserves appropriate representation. That is the job, obviously, of us and our electorate offices. But I do thank my mother for setting that stage, in a sense. She worked hard and she raised three boys, but the great legacy that I take from her is that I do not see people in shades or colours. I see them as people that deserve to be treated as people.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I have this saying: the world is run by those who turn up. We turn up. We have to make sure that others who may follow us want to turn up. I have great concerns personally about the vitriol, the short-term negative issues that are pushed, the fear campaigns. I am not accusing one side or another. It is out there in our political world and it is something that we should have a very, very serious think about, because democracy is fragile—it does not just go on and on, and if people lose faith in it this country will suffer the consequences.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">There is a fellow lying pretty close to death, I think, in South Africa. We should reflect on the efforts that he went to to create the circumstance where people could have a vote, where people could actually try and have some impact on their own futures. I think that is something that we all need to do.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">In terms of the great tragedy of this parliament, and I look at Judy and Russell in relation to this—not that they are the cause of the tragedy. Russell! One story. I was in Peel Street in Tamworth at the Country Music Festival—that great event that you will all attend next year; or once you get rid of me you will not go near it, but it is a great event. I was wandering down Peel Street and this fellow came up to me and said, 'My local member?' and I said, 'Yes, and proud to be so,' and I shook his hand. I had no idea who he was. I started talking to a couple of others and he was praising me and the job I was doing. I thought, 'This is the sort of thing we all should hear.' I said, 'Thank you very much; it is hard work.' Anyway, he wandered off. Then he came back about a minute later and said, 'It is Russell Broadbent, isn't it?' He has been accused of being 'that filthy Tony Windsor!' So I said to this guy, 'No'—and he looked at me, then he went: 'Oh, you're just joshing!' and walked off.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">But the tragedy of this parliament, if there is one, is the refugee issue. I think we are all guilty. Let's hope that we can do a bit better across the political divide on that issue. There is no need for the circumstances. There are ways through this. I encourage all members of this parliament and future ones to really have a hard look at that and try to remove some of the fear tactics that have been used.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I have probably missed things, but I thank the House for having me over these years. I have really enjoyed this work, but I do not want to love it to death. There are other things I need to do. I congratulate all those people who are leaving the parliament. I really do thank for their company Rob, the other crossbenchers and all of the people I have been involved with over the years in various committees et cetera. I particularly thank my family and friends. I notice Tim Duddy from the Liverpool Plains up there as well. He had an enormous influence on the water trigger issue. You would know him, Tony! Thank you to all those people who have taken the time to be here today. May God bless you all.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">
                  <span class="HPS-OfficeInterjecting">The SPEAKER:</span>  It is completely disorderly from the chair, but I think it is completely warranted. Congratulations to the member for New England for a wonderful time in parliament and a magnificent valedictory. We all wish him well in his future endeavours—I am sure it is not a retirement—for the next phase of his life.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I live in my home town of Charters Towers—I feel very embarrassed with the great congratulations going on with the member for New England. Most certainly it is the passing of an era. But my home town is a good example; we have lost 1,500 jobs with the closure of mines there. We were looking forward to having numerous jobs in the Galilee Basin coalfields, but the operators there are continuously asserting that they will man these mines with fly-ins from overseas. Even if they are not saying it, that is the way I think it will end up. Those 1,500 people have been left with homes they cannot sell, because prices for homes are down in Charters Towers. They cannot get jobs or starts anywhere. Companies operating out west say you have to go and live in Townsville. In Townsville, again, many people come loose from the Army every year. They are desperate to get starts in the mines and, once again, they cannot get starts in the mines. The copper stream in Mount Isa is arguably partly closing—maybe even totally closing—so the people of Mount Isa and Cloncurry, my homeland, are also desperately short of jobs. We do not want to see these jobs taken by overseas people. We believe that bringing them in will undermine our pay and conditions in Australia and we simply will not have the jobs to go to.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Nearly 200,000 migrants come into Australia a year, and some 1.3 million or 1.4 million people are seeking full-time employment. There is an inadequate pool there that can provide jobs that will enable us to go on as we have in the last hundred years in Australia: providing our own workforce in these areas. If people say to us, 'We brought large numbers from overseas,' that is not true compared with what we are doing now. People from Australia could get starts in the mines. I got my first start there. There were a lot of what we then called New Australians working in the mines. There were an awful lot of First Australians working in the mines as well. For a lot of my First Australian brothers, in a very real sense they will not be able to get the golden opportunities that were available to us when I was a young person, because the new jobs are being taken by these contractors.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I think there are four steel fabricators in Cloncurry, my home town, and one does a lot of fly-in. They have all lost their contracts at Cloncurry, and those positions have been taken by one company employing section 457 workers. So I am not talking about something that is unreal to me; I am talking about an issue that is immediate and real. Again I praise Andrew Forrest in Western Australia, who has trained up nearly 2,000 First Australians over the last 10 or 15 years; 400 or 500 are still employed in his mines as we talk, and many have gone off to jobs elsewhere, but they had a start in life which he afforded them. If you say we cannot get people, there would be at least 40,000 or 50,000 people of First Australian descent across the top of Australia who would give their eye teeth to get a start and have a job in the mines. So I commend the amendments to the House. I have broken them into two. The first one is to extend labour market testing exception for all skilled workers. I move that amendment first. </span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I do not wish to take up the time of the House again on this issue. I reiterate the irony of the ALP attacking the Liberal Party, who are only bringing 38,000 457 workers into the country. I reiterate the figures: almost 200,000 migrants a year are now coming into the country. There are a number of categories under which people can get workers. Why, over the last five years, do we suddenly have to bring 100,000 workers into Australia? There has been no burgeoning of unemployment. In fact, 16,000 people have been put off from manufacturing in the last 12 months alone and almost that number from the agricultural and tourism sectors as well. There is a huge work pool there that can be drawn upon. We do not need to go down this pathway. </span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">In addressing the specific amendments here, we have asked that the 457 workers be capped at 6,000. I do not wish to embarrass Minister Burke, but he venomously attacked the Liberal Party when they were bringing in 15,000 a year. He and his government have been notoriously silent, when they are bringing in 125,000 a year, not 15,000 a year.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This thing is not a rort, insofar as you will not find people acting criminally in this regard. As far as I am concerned, the system is the rort. You now have complete control of your worker. He has no rights because you as the employer are holding the deportation order in your hand. Quite frankly, there are myriad arrangements by which you can bypass the award system. You cannot do that with an Australian worker because, somewhere down the track, he is going to blow the whistle. But a 457 worker aint ever going to blow the whistle because, when he blows the whistle, the whistle will be shoved down his gullet and he will be sent back overseas with the deportation order.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">I am pleased to present the report to the Australian Parliamentary delegation, which participated in the 128th Inter-Parliamentary Union Assembly in Quito and also undertook the first parliamentary delegation to Paraguay. As this report attests, this was another successful and hardworking delegation. All members of the IPU delegation were all very heavily involved in the process: Mr Adams, Mr Secker, Mr Jenkins, Senator Stephens and Senator Ruston. They either chaired one of the standing committees or were heavily involved in drafting and covered Australia's delegation in glory. </span>

In this very short time I have I would like to thank all the individuals who participated and assisted with this delegation: particularly the two ambassadors, Mr Tim Kane in Chile and Ms Patricia Holmes in Argentina; also, Diwaka Prakash, who gave us advice of an incredibly high standard; Geoff Barnett and other staff in the International Community Relations Office; and most particularly to the secretary, Jeanette, for all her guidance on my first and probably last IPU delegation. I thank everybody involved. The IPU is a wonderful thing that we in this parliament should be proud of. I thank everybody involved in this delegation and for the report I tabled today.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">

                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Mr BILLSON</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Dunkley</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">09:42</span>):  My statement is on behalf of the small business constituency that once again has been neglected by this Labor Gillard government. The Federation Chamber was delayed in commencing its proceedings because in the main chamber it was the last chance for Labor to actually listen to and respond to the voice of the small business community. The coalition brought forward a motion pleading with this government not to increase the carbon tax that is already causing such harm and economic hardship for so many in the small business community, not to see a further five per cent increase in that carbon tax from 1 July and not to proceed with an increase in carbon tax costs on heavy freight transport from 1 July in 12 months time. There was an opportunity, but instead the government guillotined an important debate about an important measure to stop adding further harm to the economic hardship that the carbon tax is producing.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">All you need to do is look at the facts. We saw, in the small business Too Big To Ignore campaign, the election priorities that the Australian Chamber of Commerce and Industry have outlined. They are calling for the abolition of the carbon tax. They recognise that it is a cost impost on small business, for whom there is no compensation, no carve out and no direct assistance. Small businesses are being told to either pass those costs on or suck them up.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Today we have got some new research. The Australian Industry Group has actually had a look at what the business response has been to the imposition of the carbon tax. The Parliamentary Secretary for Small Business yesterday put out a press release saying: 'Don't worry. Small business doesn't pay the carbon price.' What utter nonsense! What an alternate universe this Labor team lives in. This survey says that business picks up the carbon tax bill. The Australian Industry Group surveyed several hundred of its members to find out what the carbon tax has meant to them.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">What it has meant for more than two-thirds of them is that they have not been able to pass on the costs of the carbon tax. They have had to absorb the impact of the carbon tax. There is interesting research here about the way in which different sized businesses have responded to the imposition of the carbon tax: 68 per cent of small businesses—two-thirds—have not been in a position to reduce their carbon intensity. Instead, they are getting it in the neck with the carbon tax—a carbon tax the government promised small business would not face. If you go further into the research, you ask what is happening there? Small businesses say that it is a lack of funding. There are already viability and margin pressures on small business. This is why they have not been in a position to invest, to negate the harm caused by the impact of the carbon tax. The research goes on to say that close to 70 per cent have not been able to pass on any energy cost rises relating to the carbon tax. One in 20 have been able to pass on a small portion of the carbon tax. This is causing economic harm and injury. We must abolish this carbon tax. It is causing damage to our economy and to small business. <span style="font-style:italic;">(Time expired)</span></span>

They entered this year and were involved in a very successful season. There was a lot of team building and, as a new team, they quickly adapted to the game of footy. They did not win any games, but their efforts and sportswomenship were outstanding. They are training very hard and are ready for next season. They have been faced with some difficulties, and that does affect the team. They were unable to play any home games due to the footy club's lights not being powerful enough for the night hours. However, next season they are hoping to have lights that are powerful enough for their home games.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">There are some challenges. Sometimes they are driving two to three hours to get to the game, and members often rely on other players, coaches or trainers to give them a lift. There can be some responsibility on the drivers, and one way that Kaitlin believes that this can be overcome is through taking a minibus for players to easily make it to their games and home safely. Another challenge is that they do not have their own change rooms, which does not allow them to shower or use their own toilets after training. And, if any of the girls need strapping or to have injuries looked at, then they have to enter the male change rooms to see a trainer, due to the trainer's room being inside these change rooms. The other issue is that the girls have been training without training tops, so if anyone wants to sponsor the Port Noarlunga Football Club girls, feel free to come along. They would like to get guernseys so that they can represent their club. </span>

                  <span style="font-style:italic;" />AFL is not traditionally seen as a women's sport. However, the girls at the Port Noarlunga Football Club have very much enjoyed their experience, and Kaitlin has indicated that they are very much looking forward to next season. I wish the women at the Port Noarlunga Football Club under-18 team the very best of luck for the upcoming season and into the future. I would like to thank Kaitlin for the time she spent in my office. She did a great job. <span style="font-style:italic;">(Time expired) </span></span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Solomon</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">09:51</span>):  I rise to speak on a great opportunity for the Top End. I am to speak about the Coalition's 2030 Vision for Developing Northern Australia. This is a clear sign of the coalition's determination to develop the Top End. A coalition government will put in place the policies and plans needed to develop our wonderful Top End's potential with more investment, infrastructure, jobs and services. No longer will the people of Darwin and Palmerston be seen as the last frontier. In fact, to quote the Hon. Tony Abbott, they are 'the next frontier'. This is an exciting development, it is great news for the Top End and I am so excited to be part of the coalition team who are going to make it possible for northern Australia to grow to its full potential.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We Territorians know how fabulous our Top End is, but we are so far away from other major cities and business hubs that we could use some extra assistance in getting that message out there to bring business our way. Darwin and Palmerston hold such potential for northern Australia, and it is great that the coalition is prepared to put its trust in us. And I know the people in Darwin and Palmerston often become frustrated with the lack of infrastructure and access to services because of our comparatively small population and remoteness. The coalition have listened to us and they are here to support our growing population and they are here to break the development deadlock that has held northern Australia back for so long.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">For far too long, many families have been reluctant to move to the Top End because of the lack of infrastructure and access to services. Governments and the private sector have often been reluctant to invest in major infrastructure because of our insufficient population. That is why I am so grateful for the coalition's support for my electorate. We have to capitalise on the Top End's existing strengths and natural advantages in agriculture, cattle, energy and tourism. We are proud to be Australia's gateway to Asia and at the forefront of Australia's defence plans and the protection of our borders. When you build a stronger economy, it means more jobs, higher incomes and better infrastructure and services for all Territorians. I am just delighted and I look forward to getting some input into our plan from Territorians, because I am sure that they are as confident as I am in the coalition's plan to develop northern Australia.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Braddon</span>—<span class="HPS-MinisterialTitles">Parliamentary Secretary for Agriculture, Fisheries and Forestry</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">09:54</span>):  I stand here today to discuss an issue that has been dividing Tasmanians for 30 years—namely forestry. On Monday, the World Heritage Committee approved the extension of World Heritage boundaries that formed a key component of the Tasmanian forests agreement that passed the Tasmanian parliament earlier in the year after three years of negotiations by industry, mainstream environmental groups and the CFMEU. This was a pretty tough exercise, punctuated by walkouts, returns to the table, constant political commentary and the old politics of the Liberal and Green parties trying to tear it down.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Tasmania is finally making progress and, with this historic agreement, is looking like it can put forestry as an issue behind us. But not everyone is happy. Some people need division and conflict. The federal and Tasmanian Liberals have constantly denied that any real problem exists. The facts are that, despite the Liberal Tasmanian Community Forest Agreement in 2006 to 2009, the number of forestry jobs halved, contractors went broke, timber mills closed and the biggest player in the industry, Gunns, went into liquidation, all without a single tree being reserved. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">A responsible government acts when an industry faces what the Tasmanian industry has faced. People were going under and whole communities needed help. That is why the federal Labor government acted to support the forest negotiations with funding for economic diversification, compensation and contractor exit assistance. As a result we have an agreement in place. We have also protected jobs in Smithton and in the Huon by supporting Ta Ann, a vital cog in the forest industry. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Ironically, on Monday we saw Greens leader Christine Milne welcome the World Heritage listing, even though she described the Tasmanian Forest Agreement as 'dead' after it passed the Tasmanian parliament. A so-called 'dead' agreement has delivered, and now it is up to the Greens and the extremies on the fringe to back it in. The people of Tasmania expect nothing else. The people of Tasmania want to see this sort of divisive politics as a historical anecdote. The people of Tasmania also do not want to see the Greens and extremies move on in an attempt to destroy a balanced mining industry in the Tarkine. Most recently, in my region, there have been a number of rallies from the community seeking a balance between responsible economic development in our region and responsible protection of those areas that appropriately deem it necessary. We can have a balance. We do not need the conflict. The Greens and the Liberals—state and federal—need to get on board and support this agreement. <span style="font-style:italic;">(Time expired)</span></span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Wannon</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">09:57</span>):  I rise today to ask the question: can the Treasurer demonstrate his incompetence in greater fashion than he already has? As we have seen already, we have got a mining tax which has not delivered any revenue. We had a budget surplus promised on 300 occasions, but what did we get? We got a budget deficit and, when you add that budget deficit to the four that have gone previously, they are the five largest budget deficits in Australia's history. The Treasurer said he was going to deal with the inflation problem, the genie that had got out of the bottle, and when he was asked what the inflation rate was, he said, 'Who's got my chart?' </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">And what do we have now? The Treasurer has done a media conference and said that he is going to fix the issues in regional and rural Australia when it comes to farm debt, that he is going to put in place a farm finance package. He did the media on it and set up the glossy brochures on the website saying how this problem will be fixed. These glossy brochures say that the Australian government is committing up to $30 million each year for the next two years to each state and to the Northern Territory to provide concessional loans to farmers in need—concessional loans to give farmers the breathing space to focus on growing and improving their farm businesses. The Australian government will work with state and Northern Territory governments to make these loan products available across the country via appropriate delivery agencies.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">There are glossy brochures up on the website, but what has been done? Nothing. We were promised that this package would be ready to be rolled out on 1 July, yet it is not ready to be rolled out. I am passionate about this because there are farmers in real need of this money. They are banking on this money. The government has led them down a path to say that this money will be available to them, and yet on 1 July they are going to see nothing, because this Treasurer is incompetent—absolutely incompetent. He has promised that he would deliver this for these farmers across this country, yet he has not sat down with the state and territory governments; he has not delivered this package. He has given false hope to these farmers and done nothing about it. Get off your backside, Treasurer, and negotiate with the states and the Northern Territory and get this Farm Finance package rolled out.</span>

Australia has worked with Vietnam over the past 30 years to assist in the development of its economy, governance, education, trade, infrastructure and to counter transnational crime. Against this backdrop Australia has continued to hold and convey at the most senior levels its serious concern at the human rights situation in Vietnam. The Minister for Foreign Affairs has directly raised human rights issues and individual cases of concern with his counterpart. Our embassy and Consulate-General are also active on human rights issues by raising individual cases, attending trials of human rights activists and regularly meeting peaceful human rights activists and religious groups. </span>

Today I would like to add my voice as a local member on behalf of my constituents to one particular case, Roman Catholic priest, Father Nguyen Van Ly. Father Nguyen Van Ly has long campaigned for the human rights of the Vietnamese people and suffered several strokes while serving an eight-year prison sentence before being granted temporary medical parole. Now he has been incarcerated again, despite his critical medical conditions. Father Ly, now aged 66 and in a very frail state of health, has spent his adult life peacefully campaigning for religious freedom, democracy and human rights. I join with my local constituents in welcoming Father Ly's nomination for the 2013 Nobel Peace Prize, both as a recognition of his courage and an avenue to draw attention to his situation. It is a situation shared by many who seek to peacefully introduce reforms to his country's media and system of governance and to ensure freedom of religious observation.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">The Australian government will continue to do what it can to pursue the case of Father Ly and others and the general severity of sentencing for the democracy activists as well as reiterate our long-held opposition to the death penalty. Australia will also continue to deliver a human rights technical cooperation program, in operation since 2006, which provides funding for practical activities to promote human rights on the ground and improve the lives of the Vietnamese people. I thank my local constituents who continue to advocate for the release of peaceful human rights and democracy campaigners in Vietnam and around the world.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">McPherson</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">10:03</span>):  Today I would like to speak about Bond University and the ineligibility of Bond University students to access OS-HELP. Bond University is based in my electorate of McPherson and has over 4,000 students enrolled and 35 per cent of these students are international students. The university has enrolments from students from over 70 countries and over one-third of Bond's international students are from Asia. Bond University has over 65 exchange partners in over 20 countries, and these relationships facilitate the exchange of students between the university and other universities in the US, Europe and increasingly in Asia. The university and its students recognise the importance of Australia in the Asian Century and the benefits of education driving our connection with Asia. However, despite the university's 65 exchange partners, less than five per cent of Bond's students utilise the opportunity to study abroad with insufficient financial support being cited as a reason for not embracing such an exciting opportunity.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Bond University, in its submission to the House Standing Committee on Employment and Education's inquiry into the Higher Education Support Amendment (Asian Century) Bill 2013, put the issue quite succinctly.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">

                <span class="HPS-Small">As a not-for-profit, private university Bond delivers high-quality graduates into the Australian workforce who have not received any benefit from the Commonwealth Grants Scheme tuition subsidy. Under the current and proposed HESA arrangements, they will also be excluded from the same incentive and support for Asian studies that is available to their public university counterparts through the important OS-HELP scheme.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I note that the House standing committee recommended as a result of its inquiry that the Commonwealth government consider extending the eligibility for OS-HELP assistance to non-CSP students.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Bond University, Bond University Student Association and Bond University Exchange Club have all sought an extension of OS-HELP for some time. Bond University Exchange Club started a petition seeking an extension of OS-HELP and in a very short space of time collected over 250 signatures. That petition has been presented directly to the Standing Committee on Petitions, and I look forward to a favourable response from the minister. I seek leave to table a copy of the petition.</span>

                  </a>  Thank you. In conclusion, I am encouraged that the advisory report contains a recommendation that I and my coalition colleagues argued for and that was supported by everyone on the committee. I would like to thank the committee, as well as thanking the Vice-Chancellor and President of Bond University, Professor Tim Brailsford; the director of infrastructure and planning, Chris Hogan; the Treasurer of the Bond University Exchange Club, Christopher Land; and the President of the Bond University Student Association, Matthew McLean, for rigorously pursuing this issue. <span style="font-style:italic;">(Time expired)</span></span>

I am incredibly proud to be the federal member for Chisholm, which I have been over the last 15 years. So I was rather surprised when a senator in the other place took a shot at the independence of the Speaker and took a shot at my ability to still continue to represent my area.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">I grew up in my area. I lived in my area. I went to school in my area. I went to university in my area. I live in the area with my family, as does all my extended family. You can walk from my house to my mother's, to my two sisters' and to my brother's. Actually, one of my largest voting blocs in Chisholm is the extended Burke clan! I am fairly confident that they all vote for me—at least, they all hand out for me quite vigorously.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I am very intimately connected to my seat. I am incredibly proud of my seat. I do not think we sing the praises of suburbia enough. That is where the majority of people live. People in my eastern suburbs put up with congestion. They put up with traffic. They put up with noise. They put up now with the loss of open space. I have been championing these causes for them for the last 15 years. So to give any impression that I am not out there working on behalf of them because I became Speaker is an insult to my constituency.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I have been to 101 events. I cannot even name them all. I have been at my mobile offices around the electorate, where people raise with me everything under the sun: Telstra bills, postal boxes, gold passes for an engineer who served his time but in two different states—he just wants his gold pass; could someone give it to him—planning issues, trees being inappropriately planted, and kerb sides at the appropriate level for scooters to go up. I have an ageing electorate; it is a very big issue for disability access and people going around on scooters. All these things are raised with me.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">But the No. 1 issue we have all had through our emails, phones and faxes is live animal exports. When I say that the No. 1 issue that comes from my electorate is live animal exports, it does not demean in any way, shape or form all the issues of concern to my local constituents or their individual problems. But the No. 1 issue people have raised with me over this term is live animal exports, and I support them. I support their call for banning live animal exports, for bringing in a chilled meat industry which will create more jobs. It will actually create more jobs; it would not lose more jobs. It will sustain the industry going forward, and it will support Indonesia in becoming a sustainable producer of its own food processing.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I do not resile from that, but I do not think that demeans me talking on behalf of my constituents. I think it recognises that I am in touch with them. I know that they are concerned about gambling. I know that they are concerned about same-sex marriage. I know that they are concerned about climate change. And I am going to advocate for them in the upcoming election. <span style="font-style:italic;">(Time expired)</span></span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Calare</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">10:09</span>):  I wish to briefly speak about my electorate of Calare, my involvement in politics and my hope for the future of our region. The Calare electorate has changed dramatically over the years and today covers an area of over 30,000 square kilometres from Lithgow in the east to Tullamore in the west. Calare is arguably the engine room of New South Wales, being rich in agriculture, mining and forestry. Without a doubt, it is one of the better places to live in our country.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I came to this parliament in 2001 as a person without higher education or tertiary degrees, but I did bring to it experience in life and in representing country people and, perhaps more importantly, in surviving and even prospering as a small business man, a farmer. Most of my professional career and family life has been centred in the central west. Lisa and I live in Molong and I have a sister, daughters and grandchildren around Orange and the central west, so I have a vested interest in ensuring that our region of Calare gets a fair go.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">In my time as a federal member I have travelled pretty widely, particularly in the central west and in the nooks and crannies of Calare, listening to people from all walks of life and assisting them with federal issues. Never have I seen so much despondency with federal politics than recently. I, the National Party and the coalition plan to change all that. What we need in our rural communities more than ever is hope and optimism—optimism to go about everyday life without the constant threat that government is lurking around the corner waiting to whack you for daring to try to get ahead.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">It is up to the coalition—and we will start the process—to turn country Australia into the powerhouse it has been, that it must be, that it will be and that it should be. I believe the electorate of Calare offers the greatest example of what country Australia has been in the past and will be again. We have to resuscitate our country, ensuring a prosperous future for all and, therefore, a prosperous future for Australians.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">
                  <a href="99931" type="MemberSpeech">
                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Mr CRAIG KELLY</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Hughes</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">10:12</span>):  I rise to honour our fallen commando: Corporal Cameron Baird MG, who was tragically killed aged just 32 while serving with the Special Operations Task Group in Afghanistan. Corporal Cameron Baird was born in Burnie in Tasmania in 1981 and is survived by his partner, his parents and a brother. He was on his fifth tour of Afghanistan and had previously served in Iraq and Timor-Leste. Corporal Baird becomes the 40th Australian soldier killed in war in Afghanistan.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Corporal Baird was a member of the Special Operations Task Group and was from the 2nd Commando Regiment based at Holsworthy barracks in Sydney, New South Wales. Holsworthy barracks is, of course, in the electorate of Hughes, which I represent in this parliament. Our elite soldiers from Holsworthy have paid a very heavy price. With Corporal Baird becoming the 20th member of the Special Operations Task Group to fall in combat in Afghanistan, this tragedy is heartbreaking for our local community. One thing that is often overlooked is that we have many people in the local community of Hughes based around Holsworthy serving in Afghanistan. We have many children of serving soldiers going to our local schools. When the news comes through that there has been a death of one of our soldiers it hurts greatly across the entire community, especially in those schools. The uncertainty for those kids is something that we wish upon no child in our schools.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The loss of any one of our soldiers is always felt hard, but this tragedy also comes in the same week as his unit, the 2nd Commando Regiment, received the highest and rarest honour—receiving the first battle honour award since Vietnam. The Governor-General, Her Excellency the Hon. Quentin Bryce, presented the Eastern Shah Wali Kot battle honour to the 2nd Commando Regiment at Tobruk Lines, Holsworthy on Wednesday, 19 June this year, just three days before the tragic events we are now discussing took place.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The mates of Corporal Cameron Baird MG describe him as one of the most iconic figures in the regiment. General Hurley said of Corporal Baird:</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Small">In combat, and as a Team Commander, he was the man to watch and never happier than when the situation demanded decisive action and courage.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The ADF stated that 32-year-old Corporal Baird:</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Small">… died how he lived—at the front, giving it his all, without any indecision.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Corporal Baird had been awarded the following honours and awards: Medal for Gallantry; Australian Active Service Medal with Clasp East Timor, Clasp Iraq 2003, Clasp International Coalition Against Terrorism; Afghanistan Campaign Medal; Iraq Campaign Medal; Australian Service Medal with Clasp—Counter Terrorism/Special Recovery; Australian Defence Medal; United Nations Medal with Ribbon United Nations Transitional Authority in East Timor; NATO non-article 5 Medal with Clasp ISAF and Multiple Tour Indicator; Infantry Combat Badge; and Returned from Active Service Badge. We have lost one of our best, and today this parliament grieves with his family and friends. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">But his sacrifice was not in vain. Over the last decade our forces in Afghanistan have made many great achievements. Perhaps the greatest achievement is the education of Afghani girls. Before 2001, there were virtually no girls in Afghanistan receiving an education. Today, according to officials from the Afghan education ministry, there are almost 3,200,000 girls receiving an education. We realise that the dangers and the threats are still there—earlier this month we read how 100 girls going to school were taken to hospital when a Taliban Islamic radical attacked the school with poison gas. These are the conditions these girls face when they go to school. Winston Churchill said:</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Small">We sleep safely at night because rough men stand ready to visit violence on those who would harm us. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Today, 3.2 million girls in Afghanistan are receiving an education, learning to read and write and to become productive members of their society because men such as Corporal Cameron Baird stood ready. Lest we forget.</span>

                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Mr ZAPPIA</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Makin</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">10:17</span>):  I join with the Prime Minister, the defence minister, the Leader of the Opposition and others in expressing my condolences to the family of Corporal Cameron Steward Baird, who was killed while serving in Afghanistan as an ADF soldier. I understand that it was Corporal Baird's fifth tour of duty in Afghanistan, and, whilst I did not know Corporal Baird personally, I know many of his colleagues and I often think it could easily have been one of them who did not return from Afghanistan. For Corporal Baird's family and his partner their loss will have the most profound effect. The bond between family members and loved ones is unique. His loss will stay with each of them for the rest of their lives, and their memory of him will always be with them. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Corporal Baird's comrades will equally have a heavy heart as they relive the incident in which Corporal Baird was killed, their service time together, their friendship and what the future might have been had he not been killed. Knowing that this was the life that he chose, with the full knowledge of the risks he faced, may ease the pain of those who grieve his death. But the pain will still be there. I also extend my best wishes for a full recovery of the special forces soldier and the Royal Australian Air Force airman also injured in the incident.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Corporal Baird's death brings to 40 the number of Australians killed whilst on duty in Afghanistan. Hopefully it will be the last. Australia has paid a heavy toll in deaths and injuries for our involvement in Afghanistan. The burden is carried every day by the family and loved ones of those ADF personnel who have been killed or injured.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Earlier this year I attended an Anzac Day service at Golden Grove Primary School in my electorate. My electorate is home to many ADF families, with RAAF Base Edinburgh being in the region, so at the service special recognition was given to the children of serving ADF personnel, many of whom were either on duty in Afghanistan or on regular tours of duty. As those children stepped forward to be recognised, sometimes with one of their parents, my thoughts turned to how difficult it must be for those children, living with the knowledge of the dangers faced each day by one or both of their parents. Similarly, how difficult it must be for those children each time they say goodbye to their mum or dad who is leaving for service overseas. I imagine the same heart-wrenching thoughts must go through the minds of the ADF parents whenever they leave home for a tour of duty, knowing that they may never see their children and loved ones again. I can only imagine the feeling of relief for family members and loved ones each time ADF members safely return home.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">This Saturday I will be attending a welcome home parade for the 7RAR Task Group, in acknowledgement of the operational service of personnel who have recently returned from operations in the Middle East. I understand that 466 personnel, including 433 members based out of Adelaide, will be welcomed home. All are associated with Operation Slipper, Australia's military contribution to the international campaign against terrorism, and maritime security in the Middle East area of operations and countering piracy in the Gulf of Aden. The personnel being welcomed home contributed to the International Security Assistance Force led multinational effort in Uruzgan, Afghanistan.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The withdrawal of most ADF personnel from Afghanistan by the end of this year will be welcomed by so many people I speak with and perhaps by none more than the ADF families directly involved. Historians will be left to judge whether our involvement in Afghanistan was justified and whether our mission there was accomplished. Whilst political leaders make decisions about wars and military interventions, and historians write in judgement, our ADF personnel carry out the deeds of war. They do so without flinching, without question, but with absolute professionalism and loyalty to the uniform they wear and the country they serve. And they forever carry the scars of war with them, a burden that only those who serve could ever understand. It is because of their service that the rest of us can get on with our lives. For all they do, to those who have served and to those who continue to serve, I say thank you. To Corporal Cameron Baird and to all those who have lost their lives, I say thank you. You have given all you had for the rest of us in Australia and it is appreciated by those of us who understand.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Ryan</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">10:23</span>):  I rise today to join with my colleagues to offer my condolences, on behalf of the Ryan electorate, to the family and friends of Corporal Cameron Stewart Baird MG and to pay tribute to his exceptional and heroic life.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I must confess that, on hearing the tragic news last Saturday that there had been an incident in Afghanistan that had injured and killed Australian soldiers, my first reaction was one of immense sadness combined with an almost guilty relief, knowing that my own son had returned from his deployment to Afghanistan several weeks ago. Not for a moment am I suggesting that my son's role was anything like the work being carried out by Corporal Baird and his team. However, last year when I was privileged to spend time in Afghanistan on the Australian Defence Force Parliamentary Program, as has my colleague the member for Longman, one thing I did find was that, if you are 'in country', incidents can occur at any time and anywhere, no matter your role.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">My next reaction was to think of all the families and friends of service men and women still on duty in Afghanistan and how, every time the telephone rang for the next 24 hours, they would hope it was not bad news about their loved one.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Mr Deputy Speaker, as you are aware, while the ADF Parliamentary Program facilitates members of parliament spending time with our service men and women in their environment, there is also the reverse program. Last week Lieutenant Colonel Todd Vail joined my Canberra office. Lieutenant Colonel Vail is himself a former commando, who has undertaken many overseas deployments including to Afghanistan. So when we heard of the death of Corporal Baird, I asked Todd for his thoughts, to try to understand, even in a small way, how it feels to lose a comrade. This is what he said:</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Small">The first notification usually strikes you to the core—I was at home at the time and found out through friends who had heard it on the news—everyone who you meet or talk to will ask questions about who it was and the circumstances in which it occurred, expecting you as a member of the Defence Force to have all the answers. However, you know no details due to the blanket media ban, which is not lifted until the next-of-kin have been notified and approved the release of the name. During this time you speculate along with everyone else. Being a member of the ADF you do wonder if you knew him—particularly as the media said he was in a "leadership" role.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Small">The news brings a sense of reality which hits home—you realise that the profession you have chosen can be deadly—you think of his family and what they must be going through—it makes you think of your own family and you put yourself in their shoes and wonder how they would cope. You also think of the injured and hope their injuries will not leave them maimed with little quality of life.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Small">Having spent time in Afghanistan you can visualise the incident, your senses are alert to the sights, sounds and smell of the Afghan countryside, they play over and over again in your mind on a never ending loop.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Small">In the end you reconcile your feelings by knowing he died doing what he loved, surrounded by his mates.</span>
              </p>

                <span class="HPS-Small">Today is business as usual—we have a job to do and he would expect us to get on and do it. On Friday we will pause, as a group, and remember him at a memorial service where his name will be added to a memorial wall along with 39 others who have also paid the supreme sacrifice carrying out their nation's work in trying to bring peace and stability to the people of Afghanistan.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">Corporal Baird's commitment to his chosen career as a soldier and to our mission in Afghanistan was unwavering, as was his loyalty to his mates and his love for his own family and the Army family. Soldiers like Corporal Baird are making a difference in Afghanistan and we must not let his sacrifice, and those of his fellow 39 soldiers, be in vain. On behalf of the Ryan electorate, I offer my sincere condolences to Corporal Baird's family, friends, colleagues and loved ones. Lest we forget.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Moreton</span>—<span class="HPS-MinisterialTitles">Government Whip</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">10:28</span>):  I also rise to speak on this condolence motion on the death of Corporal Cameron Stewart Baird MG, a former commando and a young man who gave great service to our country. He died during special ops activities in Afghanistan.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We have heard some great words from the Prime Minister, the Leader of the Opposition, the Minister for Defence and other members of parliament. I am speaking on behalf of the people of the Moreton electorate, who would all wish to pass on to Corporal Baird's family our thanks, condolences, prayers and thoughts.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Obviously, the first thing that strikes me about Corporal Baird, as someone born in 1981, is how young he was. With a name like Cameron Stewart Baird, he joins that long, proud tradition of people of Scottish descent. But I also note that he came from Tasmania, a state that makes up less than one per cent of the population but that currently provides nine per cent of our defence forces—a state that has always punched above its weight. Corporal Baird was one of its finest sons. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">To have roll off the tongue talk about the fifth tour of duty in Afghanistan can only hint at the service that this man has given our country, the people of Afghanistan and freedom-loving people everywhere—particularly, as noted by some of the earlier speakers, women in Afghanistan, who have benefited from the establishment of a rule of law and security to combat some of the extremism visited upon the nation by the Taliban. This was his fifth tour of duty in Afghanistan, but I note that Corporal Baird had also done tours of duty in Iraq and Timor-Leste. I take some comfort from the fact that a few days before his death Corporal Baird would have shared in the pride of the award of the unit's Battle Honour, which was handed over on 19 June by the Governor-General, Quentin Bryce. I am at least sure that he would have had a few days during which its members would have been proud to be the only unit since Vietnam to have received such an honour from a Governor-General.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I also note another soldier and an airman were injured in the exchange. I know that they would be feeling nothing but grief at the death of their comrade, Corporal Baird, and I wish them well in their recovery. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Afghanistan, like any overseas engagement, is special work serving the nation. The nation has called on our ADF personnel to do great work and they are doing it. Obviously, when Australia calls on our ADF personnel to go overseas the people who suffer are the families. I particularly acknowledge Corporal Baird's family and friends and I wish them well in the years ahead as they look back on the great sacrifice that Corporal Baird has made for, and the great service he has given to, this nation. In our jobs as parliamentarians we have the smallest of insights—up at the pointy end of the plane—into what a FIFO lifestyle does for families, but I have never understood how our ADF personnel are able to do the job they do and still maintain loving families. There is sacrifice all around for our ADF personnel.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Sadly, parliament has stood 40 times to acknowledge the death of our ADF personnel in Afghanistan, 30 of those occasions being in this 43rd Parliament under Prime Minister Gillard. Here we are commencing her fourth year as Prime Minister and we have done this 30 times. I am lucky to have married a North Queenslander, and my in-laws live just down the road from Yungaburra. The Prime Minister was there on Saturday opening the Avenue of Honour, the 39 trees acknowledging the ADF personnel who have passed away in Afghanistan. Sadly, there will be another tree planted to acknowledge Corporal Cameron Stewart Baird. I look forward, in a horrible way, to making my way up to Yungaburra and seeing the trees. I will make my pilgrimage to acknowledge Corporal Baird and thank him for his service to the country.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Berowra</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">10:34</span>):  Given the matters that we have just been discussing it seems very mundane to be talking about our own accommodation, but I intend to do that in relation to the 25th anniversary of the new Parliament House, which was opened in 1988.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">This House ought to be seen as an appropriate venue for the purpose of legislating. I often greet school parties visiting Canberra and I ask them about why we have a Parliament House. I ask them whether they have rules at their school and tell them that this is the place—it does not matter whether you call them pieces of legislation, statutes or bills—where the rules for Australia are made. I ask them: do you think it is an important place?</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I remind them that in 1994 I attended the first democratic elections in South Africa. I had the opportunity of witnessing people who had been deprived of the opportunity to vote. When they had that first opportunity in 1994 I saw the queues. I visited Annangrove Public School the other day and asked the children whether their parents would stand in a queue all the way from Annangrove Road up to Old Northern Road and down to Rouse Hill. They look at me with surprise and said that they did not think their parents would wait in a queue all day.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Nevertheless, it seems to me a place that is fundamental to our democracy ought to be an appropriate place. More than 25 years ago I sat in the old chamber. I think it was recorded in the debate the other day that I am one of four who remain here who were familiar with the Old Parliament House. I always like to give Malcolm Fraser a bit of a clip. Malcolm Fraser never wanted the new Parliament House. One of the most fascinating party room discussions—there may be more fascinating party room discussions in this place today!—a long time ago was when Malcolm Fraser brought the parliamentary coalition together down in Old Parliament House to tell us of his plans for developing on the Senate and House of Representatives lawns two additional sets of offices on either side to accommodate the needs of members of parliament. It was a relatively short meeting because he got short shrift from the parliamentary party, which told him, even though he showed us some rather exotic plans, that they were not suitable. I think only two people spoke, and I was one of them. He then decided he was not on the winning side.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">A competition was held. It was very interesting. A great deal of interest was taken in the fact that the principal architect, Giurgola, could not be here the other day. He is now an Australian citizen. At the time he belonged to an American architecture firm that tendered. I think he was Italian. They added a man by the name of the Thorp to the list of partners so that they would have an Australian connection. I do not care who came up with the design, quite frankly. I do not care whether it was an Australian or not. I think the design of this building is particularly unique.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I reminded the school children when they visit that this building on Capital Hill—and there was the argument about whether it should be on Capital Hill or down on the lake—was built with the hill removed so that the lawns could be grown over the top of the building and the people would be on top of the legislators. When you look at the plans—and I am sure they are somewhere; David Elder will be able to tell me who has them—of the other participants in the competition, some of them were like the buildings in Malaysia. They envisaged multistorey towers on Capital Hill. There was only one, in my view, that reflected something of the design of the Old Parliament House with two chambers on either side and the major facilities that we will all share in the middle. Down there it was King's Hall and up here it is the Great Hall and the Members' Hall. But, if you actually look at the old design that served us from 1927, I think it was, it was suitable for the purposes and for the time. The design was appropriate and has been reflected in the design of this parliament. But, if you ask me whether I would rather sit in the old house or this house, there is no question—I would rather sit in this house.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I will say a few things about the old place, because it puts things into perspective. There was a lot more camaraderie than is enjoyed here—because you were in closer proximity. There is perhaps a gender issue in this, but there was one place where people frequently saw each other—because there were no loos in the rooms—and that was the loo between the cabinet room and the back of the chamber, adjacent to the Speaker's office. People frequently saw each other at the urinal. The nature of the conversations which took place there was surprising. I do not think there would ever be a conversation like that up here. </span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">My colleague in the chamber here was just bending his elbow—I am not sure why, but perhaps what he was referring to was that the Old Parliament House had a members bar. It did. I do not often disclose the fact that I am teetotal, but I can remember when Jim Killen saw me in there on one occasion. He asked, 'What is parliament's most famous Rechabite doing in here?' The bar was a very important place. The non-members bar was equally important. Here they constructed bars, but—if you are new and you do not know—they have been boarded up. They are now the bakery and the florist's room, I think. The bars are behind the boards on either side—the Senate bar and the House of Representatives bar were closed. There was a non-members bar. What is it now? It is now the childcare centre. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The way Parliament House works has changed. We have offices which are sufficiently commodious for people to work in. They are larger than members need for their staff, because they usually only have one staffer with them. Members' rooms are amazing. They have a waiting room, with a place for a staff member, and then three other desks for staff members. I think the accommodation for members is generous. In comparison to what existed in the old chamber, the accommodation is appropriate—but not necessary. In my judgement, the accommodation in this place which is woefully inadequate is the accommodation for ministers. I make that point very strongly. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">It is occasionally commented that members are seen to be dozing in the chambers. I think someone even took a photograph of a member who may have put his head back momentarily. In Old Parliament House, nobody had a couch in their room to which they could go and quietly rest. The parliament would often sit until the early hours of the morning. I think the parliamentary catering staff have forgotten how to put on sausages for breakfast after the House has gone through until six or seven o'clock in the morning. That would test them up here. But, in the old chamber, if people needed to take a quiet moment, the only place they could go was, I think, the Parliamentary Library. I can remember seeing Billy Wentworth in there quite frequently. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I make these observations not in jest but because I believe this parliament building is appropriate for the democracy we all enjoy. I think it is important from that point of view. It enables people to do their job far more effectively than they were able to in the old chambers. There are other factors. Ministers now work from this place rather than offices elsewhere in Canberra; that has been a significant change.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">For my own part, I was glad to be able to sit on the Joint Standing Committee on the New Parliament House for a time. I sat, interestingly enough, with the fathers of two present members of the House of Representatives, Harry Jenkins and Robert McClelland. Doug McClelland, who was President of the Senate, was a joint chairman, as was Dr Harry Jenkins Senior as Speaker of the House of Representatives. Tom Uren was a member. Labor may not want to remember Mal Colston and Georgie Georges, who was the only person I can remember who crossed the floor and never got held to account for it. I do not know what they do these days. There was Kathy Martin—later Kathy Sullivan—who was a senator at that time. Margaret Reid, latterly President, was a member, as was Kerry Sibraa, another President of the Senate. Other members besides me were the late Don Dobie; Ros Kelly; Bruce Lloyd, a National Party member from Victoria; Helen Mayer; and Leo McLeay, who also became Speaker. We took an interest in the future of this building. We saw it as being important and were committed to it. I can say from personal experience that it is appropriate that the parliament be accommodated in the way in which it is. I think the building is suitable for the purpose, and I think it is appropriate on its 25th anniversary that we commend those who brought it to fruition.</span>

Parliament House was to be on a lower level, at the head of the government triangle on a site known as Camp Hill, in direct line with the axis running from the capitol to the summit of Mount Ainslie. The capitol building, atop the inner city's highest hill, Kurrajong—now Capital Hill—was to have been a ceremonial building, a pantheon that would commemorate the achievements of the Australian people. Instead of what Burley Griffin called 'the inevitable dome', the building would be capped by a stepped pinnacle or ziggurat. For Walter Burley Griffin, this form expressed 'the last word of all the longest lived civilisations'. However, it was not to be. In 1954, the Senate appointed a select committee to inquire into and report on the development of Canberra. The report recommended:</span>

              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Small">… the permanent Parliament House should not be constructed on Camp Hill where Griffin intended, but on Capital Hill on the site allotted to the "Capitol" …</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">It noted that Griffin himself had considered such an alternative. I have to confess that I am still quite partial to Burley Griffin's original design—to the notion that the highest place, the capitol, should be taken by a building that acknowledged the greatest of Australians.</span>

                  </a>  With a ziggurat. But some eggs cannot be unscrambled, and here we are today. In April 1979, the NCDC announced an architectural competition for the design of what was then known as New Parliament House. The National Capital Development Commission consulted with the Royal Australian Institute of Architects, and the Parliament House Construction Authority issued a brief and competition documents. Key aspects of the brief included that Parliament House must be more than a functional building and should be a major national symbol in the spirit of Westminster or Washington's Capitol dome. It was important that the building reflect the significance of the national parliament, the executive government and the nation's political and social context. The extent to which the building asserted that significance was to be related to questions of its scale and monumentality. The building and the site treatment were to respond to qualities of the environment that were uniquely Australian—the Australian climate, landscape, vegetation and quality of light. The philosophy and its popular success, the brief said, would depend in part on the extent to which public access and involvement was encouraged by the design. Parliament House was not to appear remote or inaccessible. Access to the site and to the building was to be facilitated, and within the building connotations of a people's parliament and open government were best to be established if people could penetrate the building and observe its operation. Parliament has succeeded to the extent that one can walk over the top of the parliamentarians—a great design feature, I believe—though its structure is somewhat different from, say, the US Capitol where voters can walk to the offices of their elected representatives, going to see them directly without the security screening we have here. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">On 26 June 1980, New York-based architectural company Mitchell, Giurgola &amp; Thorp was announced as the winner of stage 2 of the Parliament House design competition. Interestingly, Romaldo Giurgola had initially been asked by Sir John Overall, the then head of the National Capital Development Commission, to be an assessor for the design competition for the new Parliament House. Giurgola wrote back stating:</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Small">I am honoured by such an offer, but I would rather enter the competition. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Aren't we lucky that he did? The winning architectural team, Romaldo Giurgola, Richard Thorp, Harold Guida, Rollin La France, Pamille Berg, Tim Halden-Brown, Peter Rolland, Peter Britz and Mervyn Dorrough, was responsible for the design, conception, siting and architecture as well as the interior design, furniture design, landscape and coordination of the art and craft program for Parliament House. Construction began in 1981 and the building was opened on 22 August 1988.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Romaldo Giurgola moved to Canberra to implement his design and lives here to this day. He brought a team of eight people from his New York office, and three others, as well as Romaldo Giurgola, stayed in Australia after the project's completion. It is a great contrast from the way in which the Sydney Opera House construction eventuated. It does make you think, if only Jorn Utzon had had Romaldo Giurgola's patience and his negotiating skills, how much more glorious the interiors of the Sydney Opera House would be today.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The assessors' report on the winning scheme noted its unpretentiousness and accessibility where, 'children will not only be able to climb on the building, but draw it easily too'. Speaking of children, I was pretty much a child when I first came here in 1988 to do work experience for the then member for Fraser, John Langmore. It was something of a coincidence to have done work experience for the member for Fraser given that at the time I was living in the electorate of the Father of the House, the member for Berowra. My father, who was a university academic, knew John Langmore and so it was with John that I spent two weeks in this building. I have never before, or since, gotten lost so many times inside a building. The key to this building, I believe, is to like the art. I did not like art in 1988, but I do today. A think art lovers have a far easier time navigating Parliament House than those who glide by ignoring the beautiful works on the walls.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">To the successful architect, a matter of crucial importance was the relationship of the structure to individual Australians and whether people would feel comfortable approaching and entering the building. For the winning designers this was basic to their plan. As Romaldo Giurgola once said:</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Small">We felt if Australia’s new Parliament House was to speak honestly about its purpose, it could not be built on top of the hill as this would symbolise government imposed upon the people.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">And:</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Small">The magic relationship between geometry and land configurations of that plan, after that, often became the object that country often became the object of my architectural dreams. The brief for the design of the parliament compiled by the NCDC was possibly the best I had ever encountered in my professional career.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Another great tribute to the extraordinary public servants who helped build Canberra. Giurgola spoke of how he came to understand Australia by saying:</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Small">I plunged into Australian literature rather than into guides and travelogues. Patrick White, Miles Franklin, Henry Lawson and Les Murray became my real instructors, while the sonorous voice and accent of Richard Thorp, the Australian in our office, produced the right atmosphere.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I think it speaks well of Australia that we are in a city designed by a Chicagoan and in a building designed by a New Yorker, because Australia at its best engages with the rest of the world, taking the best ideas not just from within our continent, but around the globe. So it is with this extraordinary building—Parliament House. I wish it a happy 25th birthday and hope it will stand for longer than the 200 years for which it was originally built.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">McPherson</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">10:55</span>):  Australia has several iconic buildings. It has the Sydney Opera House, the Sydney Harbour Bridge, the War Memorial and, of course, Gold Coast's Q1. They are just some of the iconic buildings and structures that come to mind. But perhaps the most iconic building that has come to represent our nation as a whole is the building in which we stand today, the new Parliament House. Although the Commonwealth parliament has sat since 1901, it was not until 1988 that the parliament was able to sit in this location. The opening of the first parliament in 1901 was in the Exhibition Building in Melbourne but from Federation up until 1927 the Commonwealth parliament sat in the Victorian Parliament House, while the state parliament sat in the Exhibition Building until the construction of a provisional parliament house. When that building, now known as Old Parliament House, was opened by the then Duke of York, later King George VI, no-one would have expected that it would house the parliament for 61 years. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">As time progressed, Old Parliament House became cramped and could not cater for the 3,000 or so people working in it rather than the 300 it was planned for. In 1975 the parliament appointed the Joint Standing Committee on the New and Permanent Parliament House to facilitate the construction of a new parliament building. The parliament approved construction on 28 August 1980 and the committee recommended that the new parliament house be opened by Australia's centenary of European settlement. So, ready on time, Her Majesty the Queen opened the new Parliament House on 9 May 1988, 61 years since her father had opened Old Parliament House, and the first sitting of the Commonwealth parliament in the new building took place on 22 August 1988. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Parliament House now occupies a floor area of 250,000 square metres with 4,500 rooms, and over 5,000 people work here during a parliamentary sitting, plus all the visitors that come throughout the year. Ninety per cent of the building is made of Australian materials and each part of the building's design has a meaning behind it. For instance, as many would know, the colours of the House of Representatives and the Senate reflect the respective colours of the House of Commons and the House of Lords in the United Kingdom; however the shade of green in the House of Representatives reflects the colours of eucalyptus and acacia trees while the red hue of the Senate reminds us of the rich soils and the redgums. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">One of the great things about Parliament House is that much of it is open to the public, with Australians and other international visitors being able to come here and see the parliamentary system in action. I think there is many a schoolchild who remembers their trip to Parliament House and to Canberra, and I look forward to seeing many more come into this place and learn about our system of government, our democracy and what their part is in it. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I, like many of my colleagues, speak to many community groups and I have spoken with quite a lot during the last couple of years. We are often asked to speak and we are usually asked about anything other than politics. One of the things that I take the opportunity to speak about is this magnificent building, and I speak about it because I guess, as an engineer, I look at this building through engineering and construction eyes. But for the people that I speak to, they get to hear about a building that is so iconic, that is so important to this nation, and I try and remember as many statistics and as many different things as I possibly can about this building. </span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">Often people come up to me after I have spoken about this building and congratulate me on giving such an interesting speech—and it will have been interesting because this building is interesting. It is fascinating. I talk to them about what it was like when I first walked into this building as a newly elected member of the House of Representatives—how there is so much whiteness, so much glass—and it is probably a little bit like the starship <span style="font-style:italic;">Enterprise</span>, to be perfectly honest, where because of the nature of this parliament, when we come in we are here for the entire day and there is so much whiteness and there is so much glass here as well. I talk to them about standing on the ground floor of parliament directly under where the flag is, looking upwards and seeing the size of the flag from up so close, and how you are surrounded by so much beauty and structure in the building itself. I talk to them about a statistic that I am confident is correct, because I heard it on one of my trips around Parliament House with a guide—that is, there are about 23 kilometres of corridor in this building. I am sure that I, along with many others, have walked through many of those 23 kilometres of corridor. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">When I first arrived in this place and found myself having to move from one part of the building to the other, I was confronted with what many other people here are confronted with and that is that the corridors are so similar. Even now, as you are moving, perhaps from a committee hearing back to your office, you can easily look up and wonder whether you are in the inner corridor, the outer corridor or on the first floor or the second floor because the corridors, particularly in the office part of the building, are so similar. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">When I was finding it difficult to work out where I needed to be, as an engineer I acquainted myself with one of the many diagrams that are on the walls here so I could see a plan view of what Parliament House looked like. I have been very confident of finding my way around since looking at the plan view of it. It demonstrates the symmetry of this building. The building is exceptionally well laid out and, when you are conscious of what the layout of the building is, it is exceptionally easy to move quickly from one place to another. It is so symmetrical. It is a truly wonderful building. It is a landmark building and it is so important that we preserve it and respect it. Twenty-five years is a fantastic milestone. I am sure that there will be many more to come and I certainly join my colleagues in wishing the building a happy 25th birthday.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">
                  <a href="83A" type="MemberSpeech">
                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Ms LIVERMORE</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Capricornia</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">11:02</span>):  I was so pleased to see this motion of the 25th anniversary of the new Parliament House on the program of business this week because it meant that in this, my final week in the parliament, I could have the opportunity to pay tribute to this magnificent building, which has been one of my workplaces for the last 15 years and to, as it were, extend my valedictory speech to thank the many people, the staff of Parliament House, who have helped me do my job in this place for the five terms that I have served. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">It has been fantastic to listen in to this morning's debate and to start back in the days of Old Parliament House, listening to the member for Berowra talking about serving on the committee that put some of the building blocks in place that led to the design and construction of this building. Also, to hear from the member for Fraser, who has such a strong connection as a member here in the ACT, about how this building was conceived and what it was hoped to embody and convey to the Australian people at the time of its design. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I can still remember coming to this building for the first time in 1989, maybe 1990. I was a university student at the time and came down to visit a mate, who was at ADFA. My first impression has stayed with me ever since and it is something that I always share with school groups or people who ask me about this building when I am back in my electorate. To me, what is so great about it is that it is so quintessentially Australian. It is grand enough to be our Parliament House, to be the nation's capital building—the nation's parliament. But it is not ostentatious, it is not flashy and it is not in any way over-the-top. This is a very Australian characteristic. I think embodied in Australia's Parliament House is that sense of Australians wanting it to be appropriate but not in any way flashy or ostentatious.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The member for Fraser talked about some of the design principles that the architects wanted to convey in the building. They have been very successful in creating a building that is impressive but not imposing. To have the building topped by that incredible Australian flag, that huge Australian flag, sends out a signal of who this building is for and what this building is for. When I see it from the air, or when parliament is sitting, I cross the lake to drive up to Parliament House on a Sunday afternoon the flagpole conveys very much the significance of this building, what this building is for and who owns it. When you get closer to the building itself, it is, as I say, impressive but not imposing. The building really invites people to gather at its front and then for them to participate within it—this is something very special. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">But a building is only as good as the people inside it. I am just so fortunate to have been looked after by the staff of Parliament House for these many years. I will start with the people whom you first meet as a new MP, and they are the corridor attendants and those in the Serjeant's office. They are so friendly and helpful, and this has been the case for my entire 15 years here. Nothing is too much trouble for them. I tell you what: when you pick up the phone to the Serjeant's office, it does not matter how obscure your question is, they will have an answer and the patience to find a solution or to help you in some other way with what you are asking about. I really do appreciate all that they have helped me with over the years. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I am going through this list in no particular order but with who just popped into my head during this week. The starting point for me was when the attendants were looking after me in those very early days and making that sure that I felt at home in my office and that I could get to work straightaway as the member for Capricornia. I also want to thank the security guards for always being so courteous, so friendly and so professional. I have been to other parliaments around the world and have gone up to the security staff with a big smile and a hello, only to be met with stony-faced silence—so different from here. We are so lucky to have the security guards around Parliament House, keeping us safe and doing their job but also making everyone feel welcome and that this is their house. I cannot remember the number of times that I have had people from my electorate come here, looking a little bit lost, and a security guard has come up to them in the entrance hall and asked: 'How can we help you? Who do you want to see? Here's a phone. Let's get you sorted out.' This has always been my experience of our security guards in Parliament House. They are a great bunch. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Thank you to the clerks Bernard Wright and David Elder and to Marion Bartlett and all the other chamber staff who serve us so well. You literally make this place function and, in doing so, help us all to do our jobs and to present the best possible face of this parliament to the Australian public. I have really valued your experience and assistance over the years, especially in my time as a member of the Speaker's panel. The library staff do a terrific job as well. They are such an important but sometimes undervalued part of the democratic function of this place. Again, when you go to an overseas parliament or when overseas delegations come here they want to learn about our library—how it is structured and the role that it plays in our parliament in assisting members to be diligent in their decision-making processes in this place. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I want to thank the International and Community Relations Office, who have been extremely helpful over the years in many different ways—Onu and Paul for helping out with passports and visas, and Geoff, Raymond and Colin for always being there to answer my questions and to get things sorted out for international travel or hosting delegations here. Thanks too to the Comcar drivers, as well as Greg, Roger and Carol in the Transport Office. Some mornings you might not really want to come into this place, but the Comcar driver greets you with a friendly smile outside your accommodation and then there's a big cheery 'Hello, how are you going and welcome' from Greg. It is those little things that really do help you get through your days in this place.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">One of the things that all of those of us who are retiring are most anxious about is how to survive in the outside world without 2020, those IT experts here in Parliament House, helping us to turn things on and off and to understand what this or that instruction means. Seriously, I do not know what I am going to do without them. They are always so patient with me—I am in my 40s and I do not know how to do all this stuff. They have been eternally patient and have never made me feel too much of an idiot when it comes to technology. The dining room staff, and especially Tim, always makes you feel like a million dollars when you go up there. I thank them for making the Members and Guests Dining Room a special place—I really like to take guests up there to experience not only the view, but also the atmosphere that has been created through the professionalism of Tim and his team.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I also want to thank Hansard for always interpreting those place names in my electorate correctly and keeping me out of trouble by getting people's names right and creating that perfect record of what goes on in here. As the Deputy Speaker would know, it is a great thing to be able to mention a school or a person's achievements and present them with a perfect <span style="font-style:italic;">Hansard</span> record of it. I appreciate Hansard's assistance over the years. I also want to thank the Auspic team who always cooperate with photos in the chamber or passport photos. It is another one of those services that is easily taken for granted, but it has been great to have them on hand to help out with such things over the years.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The member for Berowra mentioned the childcare centre. My goodness, that was quite a long time coming and a big battle to get that facility, but who would question its value to the parliament these days? I am very fortunate to have my office directly above the childcare centre. What a wonderful thing it is to see those children out enjoying this beautiful building and its magnificent grounds as much as we do. It is wonderful for people working in this place to have their children close by and part of their world inside Parliament House.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I have had the great privilege of serving on some terrific committees, and the best ones have been the ones in this final term, including the Standing Committee on Regional Australia, so wonderfully served by Glen Worthington, Siobhan Leyne, Casey Mazzarella and Emily Costello. We have travelled all over Australia and even around the world. It has been great to do that with the member for Riverina, who is here in the chamber, and also with our chair, Tony Windsor, the member for New England. I would like to take this opportunity to wish Tony all the best in what will not be his retirement, but for his life after this place. I have also served as the chair of the Public Works Committee and that has been a fantastic experience, with the assistance of Anthony Overs, Alison Clegg and Fiona Gardner and my deputy chair the member for Mallee, who is also leaving this place after a very distinguished career.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I am going to say a quick thank you to staff at FCm Travel and their predecessors who, again, have always been very patient in helping me figure out travel, travel with children and the back and forth between here and Rockhampton. They have always been very quick to answer my inquiries and get me on my way so I thank them. I appreciate all the work of the gardening and cleaning staff. This is a magnificent building but, I tell you what, it would require a lot of upkeep. They keep it looking its best for us and for the Australians who want to come here and feel proud of this place.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Finally, I am going to talk about the Parliamentary Education Office. I had the great pleasure of working with Jason and Marisa in my electorate just in the week before I came back here for this final fortnight of sitting. They came around to a whole bunch of schools in my electorate to bring lessons about the work of the parliament to students. The Parliamentary Education Office and the work they do every day ensures that this building, this parliament and the work that goes on here can be understood and that those children who come here feel a connection to what we do. We hope they aspire to be part of this—to be part of our parliament—whether it is as a politician, a researcher or a staff member, or in some other form. It is the work of the Parliamentary Education Office in introducing students to the parliament and encouraging them to take an interest that will ensure this building, and the work of this building, continues to be held in high esteem in the future. Thank you very much to all the staff of the parliament who have made this such a special place to work. I look forward to returning in other capacities in the future and wish all of my continuing colleagues all the best as well.</span>

                  <a href="219646" type="MemberSpeech">
                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Mr McCORMACK</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Riverina</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">11:17</span>):  Firstly, I commend the member for Capricornia for her fine speech and wish her well in her post-political life. As she mentioned, we have gone a long way together—around the world, indeed, to Canada and Mongolia and on our regional Australia trip. Certainly, her contribution to that fly-in fly-out inquiry was invaluable.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Speaking of invaluable, such has been the work of the former Attorney General, the member for Barton, whose seat is named after Edmund Barton, the first prime minister of this great country. Certainly, there is going to be a different political landscape in the building we are acknowledging today in this motion on the 25-year anniversary of this building. It is going to look totally different in the next parliament. We have the members for Capricornia and Barton both retiring. This morning we heard that the members for New England and Lyne are joining them in retirement. But while the faces will change, the building and its service to the nation will go on. Parliament House is a symbol of Australian democracy, home to the Australian parliament and the meeting place of the nation. It was originally the ground upon which the Ngunnawal and Ngambri people used to meet as well and we should acknowledge them in this motion.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">On 9 May 1988, the building we are currently standing in—Australia's Parliament House—was officially opened by Her Majesty Queen Elizabeth II, long may she reign, 10 years after the Fraser government decided a new building was required on Capital Hill. Old Parliament House, as it is now known, was opened in 1927 and was only ever intended to be a temporary building for the Australian parliament; however, the building was starting to become outgrown and by the 1980s there were 3,000 people working in a space originally designed for just 300. Old Parliament House served Australia well—for 61 long years. It is very much an iconic building.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The Fraser government announced a two-stage competition to become the designer of the new building, and the winner was New York based architectural firm Mitchell/Giurgola, with Italian architect Romaldo Giurgola on site for the construction process. Construction of this magnificent building began in 1981 and was intended to be completed by Australia Day 1988 to coincide with the 200th anniversary of European settlement in Australia. The construction was to cost Australia $220 million. However, neither the completion date nor the budgets were met. Her Majesty opened the building just over three months after the expected date—which is not too bad, given the size and scope of the building—and the building cost a total of A$1.1 billion, making it the most expensive building in the world at the time of its construction. But it is worth it. I think we would all agree that it has certainly been worth it. I know the member for Canberra agrees that it is worth it; it is probably in her electorate.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">

              </p>

                    <span class="HPS-MemberContinuation">Mr McCORMACK:</span>
                  </a>  It is in her electorate. Ten thousand people took part in the construction of Parliament House, and the building is constructed almost entirely of Australian materials. The building is one of the largest in the southern hemisphere, measuring 300 metres long and 300 metres wide and covering a floor area of more than 250,000 square metres. We heard the member for McPherson say before that there are 25 kilometres of corridors, and that is an amazing statistic. The official opening date of 9 May was chosen to align with the anniversary of the opening of both the first federal parliament in Melbourne on 9 May 1901 by the Duke of Cornwall and York, later King George V, and the provisional parliament house in Canberra on 9 May in 1927 by the Duke of York, later King George VI and father to Queen Elizabeth II. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The building was designed to blend in with the local environment, and one million cubic metres of earth were removed so that the centre zone of Parliament House could be built into Capital Hill. This was then replaced with two curved walls and covered with grass to recreate the shape of the hill. Aside from returning the earth back to the environment, the reconstruction of the hill was also of symbolic purpose—and this is what the Prime Minister talked about the other day in her fine speech—in that it was meant for the public to be able to walk over the building and serve as a reminder to those who serve as members of parliament and senators that they are not above the public but that indeed the public are above politicians and have the right to hold us accountable.</span>
              </p>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">As times have changed, security measures have needed to be increased and people can no longer walk over the top of the building, but the sentiment is still there and it is something that I think every person who serves in this parliament should always remember. We should also remember that, as we look out the front doors of Parliament House, the Australian War Memorial is off in the distance. That building, which is a fine centrepiece of Australian democracy as well, serves to remind us that men and women died so that we could live in peace and have freedom, free speech and a free democracy—and that is so very important.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Whilst not being able to walk over the building, the public can still gain access to the top of the building where they not only are treated to amazing views across Canberra, the member for Canberra's electorate but also get to see firsthand the 81-metre flagpole from which an Australian flag measuring almost the size of half a tennis court is flown. The flag is the pinnacle of Parliament House, and the flag and the flagpole are just as iconic an image as the parliamentary complex itself. May we long retain the flag we have now, because it is a great symbol.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The forecourt is the primary entrance to Parliament House and was designed to invite people into the building. The two walls which frame the entrance almost appear as two outstretched arms to welcome people in. The complex is then divided into the ministerial wing, the House of Representatives, the Senate and the entrance, which includes the magnificent Great Hall. The public can view a large area at the front of Parliament House, but for security reasons and to ensure efficient day-to-day running most of the building has restricted access. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">If you enter from the forecourt and walk through the Great Hall you arrive in the Members' Hall, which is located outside the House of Representatives chamber. There is a water feature placed there so that anyone on the upper level, whilst being able to look down into the hall, is unable to hear conversations which may be taking place. That is sometimes important because there are a few conversations meant for private ears in this place that should stay just that—such as on a day like today when we have only a couple of sitting days left in parliament.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Each wing of the complex has its own distinct colouring system. The ministerial wing has blue carpet, and the House of Representatives and Senate have adopted the Westminster colouring of green and red respectively, but with a distinct Australian feel. The green of the House of Representatives is muted to align with the colourings of the eucalyptus leaves, and the red of the Senate is a softer shade to represent the red of the outback. People who have visited the Senate may have noticed that the emergency exit signs are red. In Australia, it is compulsory to have green emergency exit signs, and an act of parliament needed to be passed to allow the Senate to have red exit signs. These are the only exit signs in Australia which are not green. Isn't that interesting?</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Parliament House is not only a Canberra icon, but it is also an Australian icon, with many Australian tourists visiting every year in addition to the numerous international visitors who leave the tourist hot spots of the big cities to come and see Australian democracy at work. I was speaking to a lady from America yesterday at the post office here, and she admired the building. I said, 'Your President, Barack Obama, when he visited here not that long ago, was also in absolute admiration of the size, the scope and the magnificence of Australian Parliament House.' It truly is something to be proud of.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Another large contingent who visit this building every year are Australian school students. I would imagine that we get more students visiting from my Riverina electorate, which is not very far west of here, than from any other electorate in Australia. We have more than 120 schools in my electorate. The kids just love it. They love the certificates they get, which I personally sign and which the President of the Senate and the Speaker of the House of Representatives also have signed. The kids love coming here.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I remember coming to the Old Parliament House—I do go back that far—and getting off the bus and being marshalled into lines. On the steps, Malcolm Fraser—yes, it was that long ago—was being interviewed. I thought that it would be a really cool thing to be interviewed on the steps of Parliament House, but let me tell you—many, many years on and having come to this place as a parliamentarian—sometimes it is not that cool to be interviewed on the steps of Parliament House. We have all had those 'gotcha' moments, when the media have asked you a question and you have answered it and you think that it might not come out as well as was intended. But the school students love coming to this place. You can see the eagerness in their brisk walk and the enthusiasm in their eyes when they are all going into the hospitality area.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">To that end, I commend the hospitality people, because they do a fine job with the school students, and the school students are always very respectful. I love being able to meet with the students from my electorate and relay to them the importance and significance of this building and, indeed, of Australian democracy. I always get them to look out of the window at the War Memorial, which, as I mentioned before, is a poignant reminder to us all that we only sit here today because of the brave men and women of our country who have gone and fought. Sadly, more than 105,000 of them have died in combat.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I feel honoured and humbled to serve as the 14th member for Riverina. It is a Federation seat, and may it long continue to be a seat recognised by this parliament and all that it represents. I trust that this building will continue to see many more years and many more parliaments. I believe it will continue to serve us as a symbol of Australian democracy and the meeting place for our great nation.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Before I conclude, I would also like to pay tribute to the member for Hinkler, who I know is going to follow me in speaking, for his fine service. I know how proud he is to come to this place. There are not too many members who actually served in the Old Parliament House and are now serving in this Parliament House. I know that Philip Ruddock, the member for Berowra, is one of them, and he is contesting this election. One of them who is retiring is Senator Ron Boswell, the great Queensland Nationals senator. He is from the Liberal National Party, but he is certainly very much a National Party senator—</span>

                  </a>  He is very much a National Party senator, as the member for Higgins reminds me. 'Bossie' has given this place his life, and certainly he will be greatly missed. There are some characters in this place. If you look at the prime ministers that we have had and some of the great speeches that we have heard, it is a tremendous place.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The longest serving member for Riverina was Noel Hicks. He also was actually the National Party member for Riverina-Darling, because the electorate had a slight name change when they added the name Darling between 1984 and 1993. He came into this place when it opened in 1988. He had been serving in the old place. He said that the new Parliament House was well overdue at the time but that this place took some getting used to. He has very many fond memories of the traditions of the sitting nights in the old place. He said that the old parliament was perhaps a little bit more bipartisan. In 1988, 3,000 people were crammed into a building designed for just 300. There were shared offices, and the House of Representatives chamber was too small to fit the number of members elected to it. You could not help but get along with members on the other side, he told me. The parliamentary bar, Mr Hicks said, was where most of the governing actually happened. He said that there was a real sense of camaraderie and civility between members and senators and the parliamentary bar was where this conviviality was really on display in the old House. While the facilities that we have in this place are undoubtedly first class, it is the camaraderie Mr Hicks speaks of and which many retired members have lamented the gradual decline in that I think this place could do with perhaps a bit more of. We get to know the members well on committee work and delegations but perhaps it is a shame that we do not sometimes push the tables together more in the politicians' dining room and share a meal with our combatants on the other side.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Noel Hicks, however, does speak of how better equipped this place is compared with its predecessor. We even have terrific childcare facilities, which are very important. We are incredibly lucky to have such a functional, modern and symbolic building in which to debate the nation's future. This is a place steeped in the traditions of the Westminster system which also reflects the changing nature and aspirations of the modern Australian nation. There is no better reflection of what our nation is then the wonderful synergy this place has of the old and the new. I commend the motion.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Canberra</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">11:31</span>):  I would like to commend the member for Riverina for his splendid speech and also for paying tribute to those who served in the Old Parliament House and also this wonderful new Parliament House. I am incredibly proud and tickled pink that this wonderful, iconic building that we are celebrating and talking about here today is in my electorate of Canberra because it truly is a most magnificent piece of modern architecture and craftsmanship. It is the centrepiece, as we heard from the Prime Minister on Tuesday, of our democracy. She quoted former Prime Minister Bob Hawke—and I think this is a beautiful quote—who said of his place that it is:</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Small">… the forum for our differences and the instrument of our unity.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">I think that really does sum up what new Parliament House represents to us as politicians and as representatives of our communities and the Australian nation.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">It is a symbol of nation building and forward thinking. This building was designed and built to last for 200 years. I cannot imagine what the electorate of Canberra will be like in another 175 years time, but I cherish the thought that this wonderful Parliament House, which will be a grand old dame by then, will still be standing tall at its centre. Parliament House is the realisation of a magnificent design, a magnificent philosophy and a modern notion of democracy. It has been made possible by Canberra's, Australia's and, indeed, the world's best tradespeople, labourers, managers, administrative staff and professional consultants.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Parliament House was built by a team of some 2,000 people here on site in Canberra, and as many as 8,000 around Australia were involved in the manufacturing of the materials and products. Some 24 nationalities were represented among those working on this project. Anyone who has been lucky enough to spend time in this building for an extended period will know that a full range of craft and trade skills are evident in its design and construction. It is right down to the fantastic carpentry work that is in our offices. It is in the tiny little drawers and shelves that have been developed. It is all high-quality craftsmanship made with great love and great respect for the Australian people and for the actual materials, such as the beautiful woods that have been used, and a great sense of this legacy and the fact that this beautiful craftsmanship and beautiful work is going to be here for a long time. It was built to be enduring. It was built with respect as a result of that.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">One particular story that I love is that the building even called for the revival of some skills which at the time were considered quite rare, such as the mixing and application of stucco lustro, a polished plaster wall finish derived from the methods first used in Roman times. I like to think the building has therefore contributed to the preservation of these skills. I know that Aldo, when he was designing it, invoked many of those classic Romanesque architectural themes here, with the pillars and columns and the grandeur. It is just wonderful that not only is the design concept based on those principles and those philosophies but also the actual building and construction of it have drawn on those skills that date right back to Roman times.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I want to take this opportunity to pay tribute to the over 10,000 people who were involved in the construction of this project in some way or another. I hope and I know that they are proud of their contribution to this incredible, significant and historic building. I hope and I know that they take satisfaction in the fact that the results of their efforts are so spectacular, are so enduring, are so monumental and are so significant that they make us all proud as a nation. They inspire awe, as we have heard from presidents and other visitors from overseas, from right throughout the world. Most importantly, I hope and I know that they realise that the thousands of people who visit this building every day—from the politicians to the cleaners, from the schoolchildren to the lobbyists, the security guards, the police officers and the advisers—all feel a sense of pride and privilege that they are able to work in this great place. Many people who work in this building have aspired to work here since they were children—perhaps as a politician or an adviser. It is a focal point for the nation and, for many Australians and many who work here, a focal point of their aspirations. I feel that as I work here every day of the week. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I would also like to pay tribute to the people who work in this building today, particularly those who take such good care of it and of us—the cleaners, the gardeners, the tour guides, the library staff, the security guards, the police officers, the journalists, the barristers, the chefs, the waiters, the attendants, the educators, the post office staff, the bank and travel agent employees and the list goes on, including the advisers, of course. Perhaps the most special thing about this building is that it is not just a building; it is a community that it is a privilege to be a part of. It is a community. We spend an awful lot of time here together and we spend an awful lot of time in the wee small hours, when we are quite often very tired and cranky. It is a community where people provide support to one another from both sides of the political divide, and we also get support from the security guards and the other staff around here. We get that sense of support and a sense that we are all working together for the common good, we are all working together to make a difference and we are playing our role in many and varied ways. Even though we have differences in our methods of getting there, we are all here to serve the Australian people. I believe that that is the belief of everyone who works in this building. We want to serve the Australian people. We want to make this nation a better place for all Australians. We want to make a difference. It is an incredible privilege to be working in a community that aspires to that. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">In my early years as a Canberran, I watched this building emerge out of what looked like a giant pit. It was a giant pit for what seemed a very long time, and now it has emerged into this thing of beauty. At the time, I could never have dreamed that, one day, I would not only work at New Parliament House—as we used to call it—but that I would be doing so as the person elected to represent the people of Canberra. It is fitting that by now, its 25th year, we have all but dropped the word 'New' when we refer to Parliament House, although we still abbreviate its name as NPH. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I remember working on the 20th anniversary of Parliament House. I was doing some consulting—I had my own communication business before coming here. I was doing some work with the CFMEU at the time, and they were working in conjunction with a number of the architects and the engineers who worked on the construction of the building, to celebrate the workers who built this Parliament House. That was very much the focal point for the 20th anniversary program. It was just wonderful to meet, and hear all the stories of, the people who came here from all over the world to build this. There were plenty of funny stories and there were plenty of sad stories. There was a reunion lunch for all the workers. There was a reunion event here at Parliament House for all the engineers and the architects and the builders, and it was a great celebration of their efforts. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">To celebrate the 25th anniversary and to coincide with Canberra's centenary, we had the beautiful ballet that was performed recently by the Australian Ballet company, called 'Monument'. The building was celebrated through dance, and everyone who saw that, including me, was amazed at how the ABC managed to convert the built form into life, into dance, into movement. It was a challenging brief, but they did a fantastic job. I understand that Aldo Giurgola, the architect of Parliament House, attended that and was incredibly moved by what he saw. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Aldo is a very prominent figure in this building. He comes here every week to check up on his baby. He makes sure that everything is in its place. Whenever I see him wandering the corridors—he is 90-plus now—I reflect on a story that I was told when I was in Foreign Affairs and Trade about Harry Seidler, who designed the Australian Embassy in Paris. The story shows how protective architects are of their creations. It happened at the time when Gough Whitlam was ambassador. Harry was invited around to have a drink, or dinner, with Gough and Margaret. They were in the ambassador's residence, this beautiful Harry Seidler creation, and Harry spent most of the time arranging the furniture. Like all great architects, he had designed the furniture as well, and he was most unimpressed with the way Gough and Margaret had disrespected his vision for the furniture arrangements and other general arrangements—the ambience of the Australian ambassador's residence in Paris. Harry spent most of his time wandering around rearranging the furniture, literally, and chastising Gough and Margaret for not realising the true sense of the Harry Seidler vision. I do not know whether that is myth, but it is a good story. It does underscore the fact that architects are incredibly protective and possessive of their work, and we definitely have that with Aldo. I can see Aldo being carried out from here in a pine coffin. He is so attached to the place that it will probably be here where he will move on. He is a great inspiration.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Another thing I find inspiring in this wonderful building are the gardens. Even at the moment, when we are in the grip of winter, we still have beautiful azaleas and camellias. I wish my garden looked this good in winter, but unfortunately I do not have the fantastic team that they have here. In spring it comes into its own. There is a magical Japanese garden, a cherry blossom garden, which is just divine. I love wandering the gardens here every day and seeing the art and sculptures. It is not just the building that is so magnificent; it is also the gardens and the art that is in the gardens. It is wonderful seeing so many Canberrans and Australians come up during Floriade, in spring, to see the true joy of the beautiful design of these gardens.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">As the member for Riverina has mentioned, the children who come here also get great joy not just from seeing the House of Representatives and the Senate and working out what is red and what is green, and from the hospitality, but also from doing the role-play in the education room and screaming at each other. They also get great joy from seeing this iconic building, which they watch on television during the week from far-flung parts of Australia. They all come here to celebrate democracy and their nation.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">It is this purpose-built home of democracy which we are celebrating the 25th anniversary of this year. It is a symbol of freedom and hope. It is a symbol of democracy. It is a symbol of unity. It is a symbol of nationhood. It has served us well over the last 25 years and it will continue to serve us for the next 175 years. Happy birthday, Parliament House!</span>

                  </a>  There is no need to apologise, Madam Deputy Speaker. It was actually the member for Wide Bay at the time, Andrew Fisher, who laid the foundation stone for the first Parliament House 100 years ago. But we are here today primarily to celebrate the 25th anniversary of this great Parliament House. But, as the member for Canberra said, it is overlaid by the second great anniversary, the 100th anniversary of the naming of Canberra and the laying of the foundation stone for the first Parliament House. As I have said, it was Andrew Fisher who was the member for my area and who laid that foundation stone. Interestingly, you can go to Gympie—which is not in my electorate but is in the electorate of Wide Bay, adjoining mine—where there is a historical precinct and you can actually go to Andrew Fisher's house. For those of you going up the north coast anytime in the future, it is worth stopping in Gympie to get that lovely link between Wide Bay, one of the original seats, Andrew Fisher and indeed this place.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">It is hard to encapsulate what this place means. Like all great public buildings, when it was being built it was roundly criticised: 'Why are they digging that big hole in the hill?' 'Couldn't they have built it on some flat land?' 'Why do they need a million dollars for a flagpole?' When you think about it, to the uninitiated, not seeing the architectural vision of Romaldo Giurgola at that time, you would have been taken aback before you saw that beautiful architectural shape of the flagpole and so the concept of someone spending a million dollars on a flagpole was probably a bit more than some people could bear. Then again all great buildings have been challenges, not least of which is the Opera House. There were people who thought the Opera House was a dreadful building but, of course, time has proven them quite wrong—as indeed it has with this building.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I like the line in Tony Abbott's address when they had the function, morning tea, in the Great Hall to celebrate this 25th anniversary. He offered an interesting line. He said it is a bit like a young person's first suit because you might look a bit awkward and gorky in it at first but eventually you grow into it. Indeed, we have grown into this and, as you have heard other speakers say today, Old Parliament House in many respects had become a bit of a shambles with people living on top of each other, cramped offices—</span>

                    <span class="HPS-MemberContinuation">Mr NEVILLE:</span>
                  </a>  I am sure you did. From a sense of sentimentality, I am sure you did. Indeed, all Australians would still take great pride in it as being our first Parliament House in Canberra. The other thing that Tony Abbott said—which others have said in other ways—was that a 'nation’s pride in itself should indeed be reflected in its public buildings'. Those of us who have had the good fortune to go to Rome, Paris or London and see the rich history that has built up there, or to stand on the Eiffel Tower and see the symmetry of Paris and Napoleon's vision for that, know it is inspiring. So a statement about our nationhood was really called for. After all, the first Parliament House was only ever called the temporary parliament house. As others have said, it opened on 9 May 1927, after a fairly elongated period in the Victorian parliament.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">For this building I am in the imagery is very good. It is a bold statement in the sense of the grandeur of the place and the area it takes up, being 300 metres by 300 metres, cut into a hill, Capitol Hill. But then, at the same time, with the grass overlaying it, there is a sense that we have not got beyond ourselves—that, in the end, we serve this country from this place. So it is a mixture of a national statement on the one hand and national restraint on the other.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">As the member for Riverina said, the American President, Barack Obama, was full of praise for this building. I can remember that not long after I came here we had a state visit from President von Weizsacker of West Germany, as it was then. President von Weizsacker said that he believed it was the greatest parliament house in the world. That is something we can take great pride in—that we had set a standard in our public building which reflected our confidence and reflected a national sentiment. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I think that this Parliament House has some quite exquisite features, one of which is the almost total use of Australian materials. To see the rich marbles, the rich timbers and the beautiful timber inlays in the Marble Foyer—you certainly come away with a sense of pride, not only in the architectural statement made by the building but in the workmanship and the arts and skills that went into creating this ambience. The two chambers are such that—the member for Lingiari probably craves the old building a little—they will serve us for 200 years even if the House of the Representatives and Senate were to increase again by, say, another 12 members. You virtually have to go up in multiples of 12—two for each state with six states—for the Senate and then you have to double that for the House of Representatives. It is interesting to know that that next step could be taken without substantially altering this building.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">A few things troubled me this year. This is not said, by the way, with any sense of malice or as overt criticism, but I think it needs to be said. We developed, in this very chamber we are in today, something unique in the Westminster system—this idea of a second debating chamber for the lower house of the parliament. It was a very well-structured idea, which came out of the Keating government, to give us this. The thing that troubles me about it is that, after all these years, we have not developed it to the next stage. This 25-year anniversary of the new building, on the one hand, and the 100th anniversary of the naming of Canberra, on the other, is a marvellous opportunity for us to seize—to build the permanent Federation Chamber. The plans are there. Many of us in this room who are chairs of committees have sat in on consultations and have seen these plans. Having seen them, I think this would have been a great opportunity to initiate that.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Now I put to you another challenge. Before this year is out, a new parliament will assemble. To close off 2013, this year of silver jubilee and centenary, why not bookend it by at least laying the foundation stone for the federation chamber? In other words, if we cannot build the thing this year, at least make the commitment this year. We started something quite unique with a second debating chamber and it is something that has been taken up by the mother of parliaments, the UK parliament, whose second chamber is in Westminster Hall, with its rich history going back a thousand years.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Australians are great lovers of democracy and this is a significant year for us. When we reflect on our democracy we can go right back to the early concepts of democracy from Greece. In a more practical sense, we can go back 800 years to Magna Carta<span style="font-style:italic;"></span>which is the lively document upon which most of the English-speaking parliaments of the world are based. We can go out into the tourist areas of this building and see one of the three original copies of Magna Carta—an 800-year-old document and the document upon which all our parliamentary business is ultimately based. The history of this parliament—a fairly short history in comparison with some of our European cousins—contains innovations like a second debating chamber, the Federation Chamber. That is an innovation that other parliaments have either adopted or are looking to adopt. I am told that even the House of Lords is looking to a second chamber. With that in mind I make this plea in my last week in this place: this year, 2013, let us make a commitment to a permanent Federation Chamber. I think that would be a great fulfilment.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Quite frankly, I think the people of Canberra and the ACT Legislative Council have done a marvellous job. They have really shown a pride in their city in this centenary. But my sense is that, on the functions I have been to here, we as the federal parliament have not pulled our weight, first, in the celebration of that 100 years and, secondly, to put a tangible overlay on the celebration of the silver jubilee of the building.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">It has been a great privilege to serve in this building. As I said, it has been a great privilege to hear the leaders of the world laud it as one of the great gathering places of democracy. We should be proud of it. We should enhance it. We should make it the focal point of people who come to Canberra, particularly students, so that we build into them a sense of pride and national achievement.</span>

                  <a href="LKU" type="MemberSpeech">
                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Ms O'DWYER</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Higgins</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">11:59</span>):  I concur with the Speaker's remarks. I also place on the record my appreciation for the member for Hinkler. What a wonderful speech you have just delivered. I suspect it is your final speech in this place, if you are not delivering another speech in the other chamber. What a delight it has been to know you in the short time that I have been here. Thank you for the wonderful contribution you have made representing your constituents, like so many people before you and so many who will come after you. Congratulations for that.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I rise today to recognise one of the most, if not the most, recognisable landmarks in Australian politics—that is the Parliament House building itself. I am from the great state of Victoria where we may well mourn the loss of the nation's parliament from Victoria, whence it first came. But on this occasion let me say with great celebration and rejoicing that it has been 25 years since the Australian parliament relocated from Old Parliament House just down the road to what is now the not-so-new Parliament House. It was officially opened by her Majesty Queen Elizabeth II on 9 May 1988.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">With its unique architecture, Australian art and iconic features, Capital Hill is a symbol of Australian democracy and governance. One needs to see only an outline of the famous spire and flag and the building is instantaneously recognisable. We should note that that stainless steel structure—the famous spire we see each day as we come and go from this beautiful building—is one of the largest stainless steel structures in the world, at 81 metres high.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">However, the story of Parliament House extends far beyond its physical presence. It has become a symbol of the political and social narrative of this nation. Some of Australia's most controversial and defining moments have taken place in this building from the great battles between Treasurer Peter Costello and former Treasurer Paul Keating, then Prime Minister, to the national apology. This building has borne witness to some of the finest political moments. It has also witnessed the uglier side—the knifing of a first-term Prime Minister and corruption scandals involving members spring to mind. One thing is for sure, though: this place is never dull, it is never boring and there is very serious business that needs to be done here. That is, indeed, why we have a second chamber; the amount of work members need to do this place does require a second chamber in order that we are best able to represent the concerns and interests, big and small, of our constituents and the national interest.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I take the opportunity here today to pay tribute to all of those who were involved in the planning and design of this building. Everyone who was involved, from the original steering committee to the architect, Romaldo Giurgola, should be acknowledged and praised. It is fitting to also acknowledge that it was a very serious international competition to come up with this unique design. More than 329 entries were made before one was, fittingly, chosen, and that is what we have here today.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Finally, I recognise the immense work that the clerks, the cleaners, maintenance, IT, the support staff and the gardeners all undertake to keep this building and its grounds in the immaculate condition that we appreciate each day. The walls are pristine white, the floors are always polished and the gardens immaculately manicured. All of those who embark upon this great care for this wonderful building so richly deserve their credit and our appreciation. We wish the building a very happy quarter of a century. Who knows what the future holds for this place, but I look forward to hopefully being able to be back in this place to celebrate its 50th birthday in years to come.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">
                  <a href="IJ4" type="MemberSpeech">
                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Mr SNOWDON</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Lingiari</span>—<span class="HPS-MinisterialTitles">Minister for Veterans' Affairs, Minister for Defence Science and Personnel, Minister for Indigenous Health and Minister Assisting the Prime Minister on the Centenary of ANZAC</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">12:04</span>):  Thank you for this opportunity. I was sitting down in my office and I glanced at this chamber and saw we were pursuing and continuing the discussion around the 25th anniversary of this Parliament House. I thought I should make a contribution for a number of reasons. I was born in Canberra, as was my mother. She was born here in 1927, the year of the birth of the interim Parliament House, as it then was, which lasted of course until 1988. I grew up in Canberra knowing this dome as basically a paddock, a bit of scrub with a lot of trees on it, around which we drove to get into the city. Never would I have though that at some future date it might be the home of our new parliament. Indeed, on my election in 1987 I had an office in Old Parliament House.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">There are two members on this side of the chamber who have had the opportunity to serve in both places: the member for Scullin, who was here earlier, and me. I have to say there is a remarkable difference between the two places, for a range of reasons. Many people in Canberra came here to build Old Parliament House. My grandparents were here living in what was called the Causeway, which was basically a little settlement created for people working on the buildings of the new Canberra. I have a book at home which has the names and occupations of the people in every house in the Causeway during the 1920s. They were here as carpenters, bricklayers, painters—they were workers.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Not far from the Causeway, in fact very close to the railway station, was built the Government Printing Office. Of course the Government Printing Office was important in those days because <span style="font-style:italic;">Hansard</span> was done manually. The manual transcription was put down a pipe and shot off to the printing office where it was painstakingly composed, put on a printing machine and published. That process involved a whole lot of people and whole a lot of trades which largely no longer exist. My mother was a reader in the old printing office. Her attachment to the parliament, although she had never been in the place, was that at some point she was a reader, as was her sister. Other members of her family worked in the building. My brother had an apprenticeship as a machine fitter in the old printing office, which is so closely identified with Old Parliament House.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">When we moved up the hill of course things changed. I moved from a box of about nine square metres in Old Parliament House, where you literally could not swing a cat and where you had to walk outside up to the common-use facilities, the toilets. It has often been said that in Old Parliament House you struck up a conversation with the person next to you at the urinal. That is what used to happen. People passed each other in the corridors. It was a very intense place for personal communication. You could not avoid people; you had to interact with people. Indeed I recall my immediate neighbour when I first got into the parliament was the then newly elected John Hewson. Old Parliament House was a very dynamic building simply because it was too small. People had to spend a lot of time out of their offices. The dining room was a common meeting place. The bar was a centrepiece of activity. You would go down at five or six o'clock in the evening and see a few—politicians and media alike—who used to prop up the bar. The media cycle was very different in those days. But it was a meeting place, a meeting place that does not exist in this parliament. People interacted on a constant basis, and it was a very human thing. The dynamic was very positive. The old press gallery, poor buggers, sat in what was a rabbit warren—you had to walk over the roof at one point! They were close to one another, sitting virtually on each other's laps to do their work, but they were constantly interacting with the members of parliament, whether they were ministers or backbenchers, because that was the nature of the physical structure of the building. Ministers were not separated as they are here. There were meeting places, but they were rather small. So it was a very different place. Then we moved up here. I have had the privilege of serving in both that parliament and this parliament and they are so drastically different. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The first thing that struck me, after not too long, was the isolation of this building. I still think it is a negative attribute of the place. Because of the wonderful infrastructure that we have—and it is really world class, the office space for members of parliament and the office space for the press gallery—there is a great deal of separation. The ministers are in one wing. The senators and member are in other wings. To traverse from one point diagonally to the other takes fives minutes. If these bells rings, we are lucky to get to the chamber in four minutes. I have almost been caught out once or twice because of the distances in this building. So I found it a quite isolating place initially, and, although the facilities are wonderful, there was not that human interaction—and, in my view, there still is not that human interaction—that was so much part of the Old Parliament House. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">This Parliament House was opened on 9 May. The first sitting day was 22 August, and I had the great privilege to give a speech on 23 August. I have seen this place develop. It can be a soul-destroying place if you do not get out of your office. That is clear. There are people who have really suffered as a result of isolation and loneliness in this building. That is something which, as members of parliament, we need to be very conscious of in making sure that we take care of our friends. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">But the facilities are absolutely magnificent. The gym here is wonderful. I am a regular attender—I have been since the day it opened—and it is well used, not only by the members of parliament but by the staff. One of the great things about this building is that, despite the fact that there are isolated hours when only members of parliament can attend the gym, there are no airs and graces here. You are who you are, and that is it. It does not matter whether you are the Prime Minister or one of the cleaners; in this building, you are all equal in the sense of use of the building. That, to me, is a really wonderful thing.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The other obvious thing which is really magnificent about this building is the maintaining of the visual connection with the War Memorial down Anzac Parade and the way this city has been designed to show us our obligation to our past. When we walk out of the front of this building onto the Michael Nelson Jagamara dot painting forecourt and bead our eyes down Anzac Parade, we recall our obligations to those who have served. That, to me, is a wonderful thing. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Another point that I think is really very important—and this again symbolises the Australian nature of 'Don't get too highfalutin'—is that, regardless of who you are, the people of the country can walk over the top of you. That, to me, is really wonderful. The symbolism of being connected to the world community through the opportunity for people to use the outside of the building as their own—to walk over it, to be part of it, to feel it and to touch it—is a wonderful thing.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The other obvious thing to be said is that the craftsmanship in this building is world class. Whilst the architect has quite properly been given great recognition, the people who actually did the work on the building, the bricklayers, the plumbers, the painters, the electricians, the trades assistants—those people who have made this wonderful building what it is—deserve our highest praise. I know it was a boon to many in the building community in Canberra simply because of what it was: a huge multimillion dollar investment that provided opportunities for many both from Canberra and around Australia. I pay tribute to their work, because it will last for decades.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">This building really is a monument to the architect, to the people who have done the work on it and to the people who work within it. I think we have currently in a sitting week around 3,000 people working in this building. That is the size of Tennant Creek. When you explain that to the people of Tennant Creek they look at you with amazement, but it is true. This is a small town and we have almost all the facilities of a small town. When we look at this place we need to look at it in that context. It has been a great privilege—it is a great privilege—to be a member of this great parliament. To be a member of parliament in the first place is a wonderful honour and privilege; to be able to serve in this beautiful building that has been designed for us is also a great privilege.</span>
              </p>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">
                  <a href="HH4" type="MemberSpeech">
                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Mr JENKINS</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Scullin</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">12:16</span>):  I am here as part of the museum piece of the 25th anniversary of new Parliament House, because I am amongst about 75 to 80 people who have been here since we shifted up the hill. Warren came up the hill with us. He went on to bigger and better things and then came back. He has been here a long time. I think for us this is really about the events of 25 years ago, when we made the move, because in a way the pioneers had to set the pace. They were two totally different working environments. We set out to try to make sure that it worked. There are things about the new Parliament House that changed the way we engage, the way in which we actually work with each other. Some of those things, I regret, are not totally positive, but this building is such a wonderful work space and has enabled the parliament to go into the 21st century. It enables parliament to have a modern outlook and to try to make sure that we can add that modernity to the base of our Westminster system so that we continue to remain relevant to those whom we represent.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">There have been many occasions, and this is yet another one, to pay tribute to everybody—the craftsmen, the architects who had the vision—who was involved in putting this building in place. It is quite appropriate that people talk about this being a building for eons. We talk about the fact that it was built to last 200 years, but I suspect that it will be used long after that. I remember being in Westminster Hall in the Palace of Westminster in January 1988, when we were having our bicentenary celebrations. I looked at that space and thought: 'That's what we need. We need a space like that.' This week when we were down in the Great Hall with the magnificent tapestry from the Victorian tapestry workshop, which is based on the Arthur Boyd painting, I still get the sense that that is the space that will linger. Even if it is used as a reception hall and for things like that it is still a space that is Australian. It is a space that we can be very proud of. Being able to host presidents from China and the United States or the big gatherings during the end of the bicentenary in that hall, I think, was very important.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The main reason I wanted to intervene was that there are people who have been custodians of this place for the last 25 years and we should really congratulate those people. I remember that when we had the 20th anniversary people who had worked in building came back and were overawed at how good the building looked, and they paid great tribute to those that maintained it. Those are the people that I want to pay tribute to today, the people that ensure that this great Australian building, which is here for the Australian public in general, remains in the condition that it is. By doing that we honour the concepts that are involved in this building. All those who work in DPS in the maintenance of this building and the maintenance of the surrounds need to be congratulated.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The other thing that we do not discuss enough is that in doing that they continue to make it a functioning building for the times. They have attacked energy conservation and they have attacked the challenge of water recycling and they do it really well. I think that we do not praise the people that do that. In its ecological footprint this is a building that should be an exemplar to others. Of course, it has the fortune of being of a size where we can really do that. They harvest water from the cooling towers and things like that and use it for other uses. When I went down there and inspected it I was told this was technology that they had got off dairies. It is the same simple technology that is being used.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">One thing that I have observed since I have got back into the nitty-gritty of committee work is the way in which this building allows us to use IT. Audioconferencing over telephone is passe. You can talk to people and have them on screen—and they are sitting in London or in their kitchen—over Skype and things like that. This is really enabling the parliament to be brought well and truly back to the community. I pay great homage today to all those that are involved in making this large space an operating and working environment. This is a terrific building.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">In conclusion, because we have expectant associates and observers from parliamentary committees who want to listen to the responses to their committee work, I pay great respect to all those that work in the committee system in this place, from both houses. I give a plug again for my mantra that this is one parliament, two houses—or two houses, one parliament. Let us get over the hill of our rivalries between ourselves and the Senate and see that the outcomes that we have are those of the parliament.

                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">
                    <a href="IJ4" type="MemberSpeech">
                      <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Mr SNOWDON</span>
                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Lingiari</span>—<span class="HPS-MinisterialTitles">Minister for Veterans' Affairs, Minister for Defence Science and Personnel, Minister for Indigenous Health and Minister Assisting the Prime Minister on the Centenary of ANZAC</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">12:25</span>):  On 15 June 2012 I requested that the Joint Standing Committee on Foreign Affairs, Defence and Trade inquire into and report on the care of ADF personnel wounded and injured on operations. On Monday, 24 June 2013 the committee tabled its report. I would like to take this opportunity to thank the committee for the report, which makes 25 recommendations for the Department of Defence and the Department of Veterans' Affairs. I have asked both departments, as I am sure you would understand, to examine closely the report in order for the government to provide a full and considered response.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I should point out that both departments are committed to improving our understanding of the needs of veterans and their families and providing them with the highest quality service and support. I know this report will be a valuable contribution for us in continuing to develop our understanding of their experience and for both Defence and DVA in identifying any barriers to their receiving appropriate support, particularly after their military service as clients of the Department of Veterans' Affairs. The recommendations for DVA broadly address issues such as veterans' mental health, transition from Defence, and accessing DVA care and support.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">As part of the committee's inquiry both DVA and Defence lodged submissions and presented before the committee. The submission lodged by DVA focused on five key issues: understanding the characteristics of those wounded or injured in operations; a more flexible, simple and comprehensive process for recognising service related injury; working closely with the ADF on services and the transition of personnel to civilian life; effective ongoing care and support after discharge; and readiness for the future. I should say that DVA has a strong and I believe proud history of supporting those men and women who have suffered and have offered service to our nation and the families that have made sacrifices to support them.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">DVA's submission to the committee provided information on a number of initiatives aimed specifically at providing care and support to those wounded or injured on operations since 1999. Over the course of the department's 94 years of operation it has developed considerable knowledge and skills in understanding the risks and effects arising from the unique and demanding nature of military service. As such, DVA is transforming its service delivery models to meet the emerging and ever-changing needs of the contemporary cohort of veterans and their families.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I think it is important that we emphasise that immediate help is available for eligible veterans, including those currently serving with operational service such as in Afghanistan or Iraq, to access mental health treatment without the need to lodge a compensation claim. For eligible veterans with diagnosed post-traumatic stress disorder, other anxiety or depression, DVA will pay for immediate treatment. This access to immediate treatment for mental health concerns is separate to applying for compensation.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I welcome the committee's acknowledgement that, for the most part, the care provided to Australia's wounded and injured is world-class, particularly in the immediate aftermath of a battlefield incident. The committee states:</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">The Departments of Defence and Veterans’ Affairs have honoured their responsibilities to support the recovery and rehabilitation of these individuals and their families and, through various programs, continue to improve veteran support processes and coordination.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">Unfortunately—</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">as referred to in chapter 6 of the report—</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">some veterans still ‘fall through the cracks’. This has to end. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I acknowledge that there is still more work for both the Department of Defence and the Department of Veterans' Affairs in this space to enhance the support they provide to our wounded and injured personnel. However, I think it is important to recognise that there is significant effort already underway in both departments to respond to the needs of these personnel. For instance, one recent initiative between DVA and Defence is the establishment of the ADF servicewomen's steering committee comprising current serving and former female ADF members, including reservists.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">DVA also appreciates there are concerns for some veterans transitioning from Defence and the nature of the claims process. Both DVA and Defence have in recent years focused on improving transition of veterans from the ADF to DVA care. I must say that this is an issue which I have been driving very hard since I was first put into the DVA portfolio. Having been the Minister for Defence Science and Personnel, it occurred to me then as it does now that there is greater capacity for these two agencies to work more closely together to look after the needs of serving veterans. DVA will continue to work closely with Defence towards a seamless transition and to streamline the claims process—a process which, I know, is being taken on board by both agencies as a key component of what they are about.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Most of the report was focused on research. DVA is committed to a strong research program. Much of the report also focused on research, and I have commented on that. A new strategic research program will strengthen research relationships through collaboration with other research bodies and organisations, including Defence, and ensure that research is focused on the department's priorities. This will involve, importantly, developing relationships with the Defence Science and Technology Organisation, the key scientific adviser to the Department of Defence, for which I am also responsible.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Defence stands by its commitment to ensure ADF personnel always receive higher quality care, and the contact with Medibank Health Solutions underpins this commitment. Defence is holding MHS accountable for effective service delivery by closely monitoring performance against the contracted obligations and agreed performance indicators. This is a matter which is close to the front of my mind because I regularly visit the Defence facilities and have cause for discussions both with Defence health personnel and with service personnel, and we talk candidly about the access they have or do not have, depending on where they are, to appropriate health care services.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">DVA and Defence are cooperating extensively and DVA is working with the ADF to make the process of discharge from the military into civilian life as smooth as possible, including for those personnel who have sustained wounds or injuries from their service. Both departments have recently renewed their commitment to supporting the ADF community with a signing of a memorandum of understanding. This MOU is for the cooperative delivery of care and support to eligible persons. The Support to Wounded, Injured or Ill Program, SWIIP, was established as a joint Defence and Veterans' Affairs undertaking that aims to provide coordinated, transparent and seamless support to individuals during their service and after transition from the ADF, including by enhancing support for personnel with complex or serious medical conditions who are transitioning to civilian life; improving information sharing between DVA and Defence relating to injury or illness; and streamlining and simplifying compensation claims handling. There are other initiatives which we have in play to assist those wounded and injured in operations, the first of which is soldier recovery centres. Soldiers wounded or injured are also already seeking care and services at soldier recovery centres on bases in Townsville and Darwin, with a third on its way in Brisbane. These centres provide a dedicated health precinct to those members to rehabilitate, recover and return to their duties.</span>

I was going to talk about the veterans mental health budget package of $26.4 million in the 2013-14 budget and I was also going to talk to you about the mental health strategy and the review of military compensation arrangements, so this is in response to the review of military compensation arrangements. The Veterans' Affairs Legislation Amendment (Military Compensation Review and Other Measures) Bill 2013 was introduced into the parliament on 20 March 2013. We are hopeful it will pass through the Senate this week.</span>

It is the result of hours and hours of discussion and hearings with people from all over Australia—with families, with vets, with public servants and with serving soldiers. It is a very comprehensive body of work and it has been a great pleasure to take part in this very comprehensive review. It is impossible to exaggerate what we owe to our service personnel. In thanking them for their efforts and showing our gratitude for the work they do in securing our nation and preserving the democracy here, we have to ensure that we provide the highest standard of care for both those who are currently in service and veterans.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The report covers a broad range of areas. As I said, it is a comprehensive body of work and it covers a broad range of areas. They range from the immediate action following an injury; aeromedical evacuation, which focuses on some of the activities that we are getting involved in in Afghanistan; rehabilitation and support following physical injury; mental health concerns; return from operations; and post-service issues, including Veterans' Affairs and veterans' support structures.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The report also highlights a number of gaps. Previous speakers have mentioned those gaps, or those areas where things are falling through the cracks—as one of the chapters is called—and areas where there can be improvement, and also areas of excellence. With the areas of excellence, the report underlines the fact that we are working very well in the aeromedical evacuation space. However, there are areas of concern and they include garrison health support, female veterans' mental health, improving communications between Defence and DVA in the management of post-service transition, continuing problems—despite improvements—in the nature of services provided by DVA, and the continued need to improve cultural understanding and empathy. That is particularly important.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">In terms of progress in relation to areas of concern, there has been a strong recognition—as we have heard from Minister Snowdon—of the need to support those with mental health issues. Baby steps have been taken to make improvements in terms of streamlining the Veterans' Affairs-Defence processes and streamlining the information on injured soldiers. All the matters that are covered in this report are incredibly important. We have seen evidence of terrible hardship and unhappiness among our service people, as a result of their treatment. They have fallen through the gaps in this process, despite the best efforts of the ADF and DVA.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I want to focus on four areas where we can improve. The first concerns female veterans. As the report notes, the committee was very concerned about the issues raised in the June 2012 report <span style="font-style:italic;">Th</span><span style="font-style:italic;">e</span><span style="font-style:italic;">h</span><span style="font-style:italic;">ealth and wellbeing of female Vietnam and contemporary veterans</span>. One of our recommendations is that the government implement, as a priority, the recommendations of that report, which was prepared by Dr Samantha Crompvoets. The recommendations in that report are to, as an overview:</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-SmallBullet" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-SmallBullet">Develop targeted support and resources for female veterans</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-SmallBullet" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-SmallBullet">Increase the visibility of experiences of and services for female veterans</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-SmallBullet" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-SmallBullet">Facilitate continuity of learned coping strategies post-discharge</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-SmallBullet" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-SmallBullet">Implement and evaluate family friendly practices</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-SmallBullet" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-SmallBullet">Provide training to civilian health care providers on issues for female veterans</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-SmallBullet" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-SmallBullet">Develop best practice guidelines for the treatment and care of female veterans</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-SmallBullet" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-SmallBullet">Set a strategic research agenda on female veterans' health</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We found these recommendations to be consistent with our recommendations, but I would like to stress that the care of female veterans does require a special effort. Hence the Crompvoets recommendation that there be targeted support, and resourcing is particularly important.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The other area that the report touches on is the cultural issues in mental health. I have personally been made aware of problems faced by service personnel in coming to terms with their incapacity, particularly in cases of post-traumatic stress disorder and other mental illness. Despite efforts, this is in part caused by the continuing culture of stigmatisation and shame in the ADF. As stated in the report, we were impressed by the work that General Cantwell and organisations such as Soldier On and Young Diggers are doing in terms of changing this culture. It is an area where ADF and the department do need to continue to focus their efforts. Despite the fact that there are a number of programs in place, there is still the issue of stigmatisation and shame and, as a result of that, individuals and returning soldiers are ignoring the signs of mental health issues and other injuries. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The report also focuses on the need for early recognition of mental health problems, because they do take time to be identified and diagnosed. Usually it is the families—the wives, the girlfriends, the children, the partners—who are on the frontline of those issues and who bear the brunt of them even before diagnosis. My father-in-law did two tours of Vietnam and my mother-in-law always said that the man who returned was very different to the man she married. Since Vietnam the issue of PTSD has become an increasing area of focus and attention, but now that we are aware of its symptoms and how it can emerge through alcoholism, domestic violence, depression and other mechanisms there can no longer be any excuses for us not knowing or treating it appropriately.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The report also highlights the post-service life adjustment and how hard it is for a wounded or injured soldier to adjust from being a highly skilled member of a professional force—a warrior, so to speak—to a seemingly constrained civilian. The inquiry has grappled with this issue. We have highlighted the need for greater continuity in the transition from Defence to Veterans' Affairs and we have recommended expediting or streamlining information technology connectivity and a unique service veteran health ID number. That is extremely important and it is a theme that ran through a number of the presentations in the hearings. DVA still faces dissatisfaction from the veteran community, although we found the department is doing much to improve client service, particularly in having a single point of contact for case management, moving to a single electronic claim process, and free treatment for PTSD, depression and anxiety. We have recommended that the department try to be less prescriptive, as well as monitoring its performance through periodic publication of claim processing times and claim success rates. This will need constant attention, but I hope the work of the committee will help to bring about improvements and make for better lives for our service people and their families after suffering physical or mental injury. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I am very proud to be associated with this report. I know everyone on the committee has had discussions with returning soldiers who have been injured or are suffering mental health issues. It is good to have all this consolidated in one report and to take a comprehensive and forensic approach to reviewing the existing treatment to highlight the gaps and then to work out how to make improvements. It is a report that brings together a very great number of issues and makes a serious attempt to find solutions. I would like to commend the Chair of the Defence Sub-Committee, Senator Mark Furner, for his great contribution, and the secretariat for their invaluable work.</span>

                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Canberra</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">16:00</span>):  As the deputy chair of the parliamentary Joint Select Committee on Gambling Reform, it is a pleasure to speak on the tabling of the committee's sixth and final report. This report covered the remaining bills referred to the inquiry: the Poker Machine Harm Reduction ($1 Bets And Other Measures) Bill 2012, the Anti-Money Laundering Amendment (Gaming Machine Venues) Bill 2012 and the Interactive Gambling Amendment (Virtual Credits) Bill 2013. I take this opportunity to put on the record the government's work in this area during the life of the committee. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The government is committed to addressing problem gambling and it has taken a number of steps to progress reform in this area. In November 2008, the government asked the Productivity Commission to inquire into problem gambling in Australia. The report was presented in February 2010. The COAG Select Council On Gambling Reform was established in 2010 to develop a national response to the findings and recommendations of the Productivity Commission report. In May 2011, the select council agreed that pre-commitment is a useful tool to help people set limits on how much they want to spend on poker machines and it was agreed to support the required infrastructure for pre-commitment technology in all jurisdictions. Building on this agreement, there was consultation with stakeholders, including consultation on an exposure draft of the national gambling reform legislation. In January 2012, the government outlined its approach to helping Australians affected by problem gambling. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The National Gambling Reform Act 2012 is the first time the federal government has legislated to address problem gambling. New poker machines will be capable of pre-commitment technology and eventually all poker machines must be part of a state-linked pre-commitment system but smaller venues will have additional time for implementation. The government also announced the development of electronic warnings and cost of play displays on poker machines, a $250 a day ATM withdraw limit from ATMs in gambling venues—excluding casinos—and additional counselling support. Self-exclusion arrangements will also be strengthened and there will be improved training for staff in venues.  The government committed to and has been working on a large scale trial of mandatory pre-commitment in the ACT. Clubs ACT has decided to postpone the trial until after the federal election, but work continues on optimum trial design and trial preparation. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The committee's third report covered the area of prevention and treatment of problem gambling. The committee made a number of suggestions to improve the messages in social marketing initiatives, including campaigns and education initiatives to address stigma and stereotypes. I note the government is conducting a trial project which aims to reduce the stigma of problem gambling by supporting former problem gamblers, or people affected by problem gambling, to talk about their experiences at community awareness sessions. Findings from this project will be used to further explore the consequences and causes of stigma and how this can be reduced or mitigated. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">In the area of online gambling, the government has undertaken a review of the Interactive Gambling Act 2001. The final report was released in March and the Minister for Broadband Communications and the Digital Economy announced that the government would work with states and territories to implement a national harm minimisation and consumer protection standard for all licensed online gambling activities. In consultation with states and territories, the government continues to further examine the recommendations of the review with respect to enforcement and deterrence, advertising, education and awareness and social media. The recently tabled report, on the promotion of sports betting, recognised the level of community concern on this issue. There is a great level of community concern on this issue. The government has listened to the concern and in May the Prime Minister announced that live odds would be banned during the broadcast of live sports matches and generic gambling advertisements would be banned during play. The government has also taken steps to safeguard the integrity of sport by establishing the National Integrity of Sport Unit to work with stakeholders to ensure a national approach to regulation and to prevent match fixing through education programs.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The committee heard during its inquiries about the need for more targeted and coordinated research. The national gambling reform act 2012 established the Australian Gambling Research Centre to enhance national gambling research. I very much welcome that initiative. The centre begins in July and will be located within the Australian Institute of Family Studies. The government has indicated that areas identified by the committee as requiring further research will inform consideration of the centre's work agenda.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">It has been a privilege to be deputy chair of this committee and to see the tabling of its final report. I thank the member for Denison for very capably chairing the committee. I thank my fellow committee members and I would particularly like to thank the secretariat, who did excellent work and often in very short time frames. I would like to thanks and commend Lyn Beverley. I commend the report to the House. <span style="font-style:italic;">(Extension of time granted.)</span></span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">It was an incredibly enjoyable journey being on this committee as deputy chair. At really highlighted to me the fact that there are significant issues with problem gambling in the community. We heard throughout the course of my time on the committee about people who are suffering significant economic hardship, people whose marriages have broken down, people who had lost their homes, people who had lost custody of their children and people who were experiencing significant hardship as a result of gambling addiction. It really underscored to me the fact that there is a problem in the community and that we need to do something to address it. We as a government have engaged in a number of initiatives to address it through a number of mechanisms, most recently in the sports betting area.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I know that all of us here will have received an enormous amount of emails and other feedback from the community about how people were greatly offended by the intrusion into the pleasure of sport that came with live odds betting and sports-betting advertisements. It was a tsunami in many ways. There is no way that you could miss it when you were watching sport on a Saturday afternoon. There was, rightly, an outcry amongst the community and we as a government responded to that outcry.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">For me, one of the most rewarding elements of being on this committee as deputy chair was the fact that we managed to take a close look at the research in the field and it highlighted a number of gaps in the gambling arena. First off, gambling is not actually recognised as an area for research under the NHMRC grants criteria, which makes it difficult for researchers who want to enhance our understanding of the issues associated with problem gambling and its impacts. It is difficult for them to gain an understanding if they cannot get grants. I really welcome the government's initiative to establish the research centre. That will ensure that we gain a greater understanding of these problems and through that gain a greater evidence base. Our response can then be based on what is actually happening in the community rather than on small pockets of research. It has been an incredibly rewarding experience and it has highlighted for me that the research is a real soft spot. I welcome the fact that we have established this centre and I look forward to hearing of the research that emanates from it in a range of areas, including the problem gambling area—the impact of sports betting advertising, of poker machines and a whole range of gambling components which impact on the community, particularly on children. One of the areas that was highlighted was the potential impact on children of sports betting advertising and gambling advertising in the community.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Research was one of the areas which I was particularly pleased with, with the gaps that were highlighted. Our hearings and the inquiries highlighted these gaps, and as a result we did not have a strong evidence base on which we could develop appropriate policy reactions. I believe that the policy reactions we have developed have been appropriate, but it would be helpful to have that very strong evidence base moving forward in our response as public policymakers to this issue which is a concern to the broader community.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I would particularly like to thank the committee which worked on this. It was a committee of very colourful characters with very passionate views. Senator Xenophon is well known as a very strong advocate of this issue and he has been a long-time advocate. It was a pleasure to work with him. He is so knowledgeable in this arena and so passionate about the issue, as is the member for Denison, Mr Wilkie. They are both very committed to eliminating problem gambling in the community, establishing the right policy reactions and frameworks and establishing the right research evidence base to address those issues. I would also like to thank Senator Madigan, who also added a great deal to the committee with his observations, as well as those from the other side of the chamber. Generally we had a bipartisan approach to the issues and a bipartisan concern. While we had differing reactions to the responses to those issues that were highlighted in the inquiries, I believe that we all went into the inquiries and into closer examinations with a strong will to improve the situation and to ensure that we can, as far as possible, eliminate problem gambling in the community. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">It is a significant problem in the community. We heard from people who have been very badly damaged physically, economically, socially and emotionally, and it is very important that as policymakers we establish as many mechanisms as possible to ensure that these people are protected in the future, as well as children. There are pockets of evidence where research is being done—and I commend those who are conducting the research—which show that children are engaging in gambling, particularly sports gambling, at a very young age. We have all heard stories from nieces and nephews or sons and daughters recounting to us the odds of a particular game that is taking place. Rather than sitting and enjoying the game, they are recounting the odds for who will win and who will not win. We cannot allow that sort of culture to grow. That is why I really welcome the initiatives that the government has introduced on the sports betting front.</span>

                    </a>
                    <span class="HPS-Time"> (Calwell) (16:14):</span>  It is a great pleasure to have the opportunity today to speak to the report following the recent inquiry conducted by the Human Rights Subcommittee of the Joint Standing Committee on Foreign Affairs, Defence and Trade, entitled <span style="font-style:italic;">Trading lives: </span><span style="font-style:italic;">m</span><span style="font-style:italic;">odern day human trafficking</span><span style="font-style:italic;">. </span>The inquiry gave the committee an opportunity to look at some very serious issues pertaining to the trafficking of human beings on a global level. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This report comes at a time when the movement of people around the world has never been greater and the need to do more in eliminating forced labour, slavery and trafficking from global supply chains has never been more pressing. The report's findings are timely and very, very important. The report has delivered eight recommendations, and those recommendations are indeed a fair reflection of the submissions that were made to the inquiry. There were some 82 submissions made to the inquiry, and the recommendations are a genuine response to the issues raised in those 82 submissions and, of course, the subsequent 10 public hearings that were conducted.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">All the recommendations were supported by members of the committee. I support all the recommendations, and today I want to speak particularly to recommendation 7, under the heading 'Exploitation in the supply chain'. This recommendation recommends that the Australian government investigate antitrafficking and antislavery mechanisms appropriate for Australia, with a view to creating a greater awareness of forced labour in the global supply chains. It is the one, as I said, that I want to speak to today, because in many ways it reflects the efforts made by people in the community, including those in my own local community, and the lobbying I received from them on this issue.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">There are an estimated 20 million victims of forced labour globally, and the annual profit made from these victims is estimated to be some $32 million. So it is quite clear that more needs to be done in our community both at home and abroad to raise awareness of this issue, because this issue of forced labour is one that can be best and only described as a stain on humanity. It has been due to the efforts of long-serving community members in my electorate and in the broader NGO community who have lobbied government endlessly and relentlessly to ensure that a call for action on human trafficking remains at the centre of the political debate. Many of these advocates are in my home state of Victoria and I am very pleased, as I am sure they will be pleased, with the committee's overall findings and, in particular, with recommendation 7.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Recommendation 7, as I said, recommends that the Australian government, in consultation with relevant stakeholders, undertake a review to establish antitrafficking and antislavery mechanisms appropriate for the Australian context. The review should be conducted with a view to introducing legislation to improve transparency in the supply chains, the development of a labelling and certification strategy for products and services that have been produced ethically, and increasing the prominence of fair trade in Australia. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Recently, I met with members of 11 churches from my local community, and I want to name them because this was a very important meeting. They were members from the Broadmeadows Uniting Church, the Broadmeadows/Dallas Anglican Church, St Mary's Anglican Church in Sunbury, Hume Anglican parish, the Sunbury Baptist Church, the Salvation Army Craigieburn Corps, the Providence Road Uniting Church, the Gladstone Uniting Church, the Holy Child Catholic Church, the Sunbury Uniting Church, the Craigieburn Uniting Church. Reverend Peter Weeks and Dr Mark Zirnsak, who is the Director of the Justice and International Mission Unit Synod of Victoria and Tasmania, were present as well.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The group met in my office to present me with postcards that are part of a campaign aimed at stopping the slave labour that is going on in the world at the moment. The campaign is urging action, particularly action that requires companies to ensure that goods imported into Australia are free from slavery and human trafficking. The group has been advocating government to ensure that the government commission its own research to identify goods being imported into Australia where there are significant risks of slavery, forced labour, trafficked labour or, worst of all, child labour. All of this should be identified, isolated and targeted in the global supply chain. The group's campaign calls for the establishment of a working group, with representatives from government, law enforcement, businesses, NGOs and academics, to identify measures for businesses to take to ensure that their supply chains are clean of slavery, forced labour, trafficked labour and child labour.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The campaign also calls for the introduction of legislation requiring companies to report on what steps they are taking to mitigate the risks of slavery, forced labour, trafficked labour and child labour. The campaign also seeks the amendment of the Financial Management and Accountability Act 1997 and the Commonwealth Procurement Guidelines to require suppliers to government to have to provide a written assurance that they have taken all reasonable steps to ensure their supply chain is free of slavery, forced labour, trafficked labour and child labour.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">My meeting with the local churches showed overwhelming support for federal government action requiring both the private and public sectors to make sure that products imported into Australia do not make profit from slavery and human trafficking. The group presented me with a postcard campaign. It is called 'Stop the Traffik: Slavery Free Guarantee'. Their aim is to get as many of these postcards as they can to us here in the parliament and the government.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">If sweatshops can exist in Australia, underpaying workers and keeping them in substandard conditions, it is not difficult to imagine people in the world's poorest countries being most inhumanely cheated and exploited, used as child labour and, worst of all, held in bondage. The Uniting Church's Justice and International Mission Unit director, Dr Mark Zirnsak, told us at that meeting that he had received research which was conducted by the US Department of Labor and United Nations agencies that had identified goods coming into Australia from countries where slavery and human trafficking was involved. Dr Zirnsak has indicated:</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Small">What we do know is that the production of agricultural goods is where slavery is most strong.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Small">Cotton production, palm oil, also bricks and pavers, quarrying out of India, coltrane from the Congo that goes into mobile phones – all use bonded labour …</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Dr Zirnsak has also indicated:</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">With Uzbekistan cotton, between one and two million people are forced into labour …</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">That is an occurrence on a mass scale and one that we need to be very concerned about. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Dr Zirnsak and the group that met with me were deeply concerned that, at this stage, no government efforts were being made to identify Australian companies importing goods or services that involve bonded labour or slavery. He also suggested that Australia was lagging behind other developed nations, most notably the United States, in applying pressure on companies to ensure that goods they import or sell are free from slavery and human trafficking. The group has called, quite strongly, for a slavery-free guarantee system that is similar to Fairtrade. This report addresses a lot of the concerns that were raised with me. I have received many of those postcards, and I will be endeavouring to present them to the Attorney-General, the Hon. Mark Dreyfus. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">In conclusion, there is another group that I want to pay tribute to. It is a group that I have had a longstanding association with. It is ACRATH, Australian Catholic Religious Against Trafficking in Humans. This group is endorsed by Catholic Religious Australia, which is the peak body of 190 religious orders in Australia, representing 800 religious sisters, brothers and priests. For the past I do not know how many years that I have been up in this place, I have—</span>

                    </a>  I know. I have been visited by a wonderful group of women, predominantly nuns from ACRATH. These women are absolutely, totally dedicated to advocating on behalf of those women and children, in particular, who are victims of slavery and child labour.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I would like to name them individually because every year they are up here and they deserve to be commended for the efforts that they make. I would like to commend the work of Ann Tormey, Brianna Lee, Carol Hogan, Carole McDonald, Denise Mulcahy, Genny Ryan, Janine Bliss, Jennifer Bird, Diane Kennedy, Marie Marsh, Margaret Ng, Therese Power, Christine Carolan and Louise Cleary, who is the National Chair of ACRATH. I want to commend them because they come up here each year to convey their anti-human-trafficking messages to members of parliament and also to ministers and shadow ministers.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The women, who are the Catholic sisters and their colleagues, are all members of this organisation and they come up here to ever-so-gently lobby for government to act in righting the terrible and inhumane wrongs committed against vulnerable people—women and children in particular. They met with ministers and policymakers and, over the years of their advocacy, they have managed to achieve many changes. It is to their credit that they have been able to make significant changes.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">They were involved in a public hearing in Melbourne in May this year, and it is quite apt that I quote the chair of the foreign affairs subcommittee, the Hon. Laurie Ferguson, who congratulated ACRATH on its activities, saying that he thought that ACRATH was 'the main group' of this inquiry that led the committee to holding this inquiry, based, as he said, on ACRATH's activities and he noted 'your appearance before the committee at various stages and your lobbying'. So the chair of the human rights subcommittee commended them and also referred to them as being the essence that inspired this inquiry.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I would like to thank them and also thank members of my own community who are lobbying me, and I would also like to thank Dr Mark Zirnsak for the work that he does in making sure that we never forget that we live in a world where profits are made on the back of slavery, especially that of young children and women, and it is our responsibility as policymakers to do whatever we can, through legislation if necessary, to protect the vulnerable both here in this country and also internationally. I commend the report to the House.</span>

As a committee member, I am proud to be associated with the detail of the report that very accurately reflects many of the views and perspectives and the work that is being done within Australia with respect to finding not only a cure for, or a slowing down of, dementia, but also the identification of the early diagnostic elements that will enable medical advice and support to come at a much earlier point.</span>

I would also like to acknowledge: the deputy chair of the health and ageing committee who worked on this report, the member for Swan; the chair of the committee, who was here a moment ago; and the other members of the committee—the member for Hasluck and the member for Bass. They have all been members of the committee and contributed to this report.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">It gives me great pleasure to speak about this report on the early diagnosis of and intervention on dementia, titled <span style="font-style:italic;">Thinking ahead</span>. This report is relevant to all of Australia but particularly in my electorate as one of the oldest in the country, with almost 20 per cent of people over the age of 65. It has one of the highest rates of people diagnosed with dementia in the country. I have heard countless tales from families and constituents of my electorate firsthand about the devastation it can cause in our community. We on the inquiry when we travelled to most major cities and all around the country also heard firsthand from different communities about dementia and the devastation it can cause.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This inquiry and report before us make it quite clear that there needs to be greater awareness of dementia and that more action towards a dementia-friendly future needs to be taken. We know that one of the most important things that we can do to combat severe dementia is ensure that patients are diagnosed in a timely manner. With early detection the quality of life for people with dementia as well as for their family and carers is often dramatically increased. We heard this during the inquiry. People, for example, when diagnosed in a timely manner can put their affairs in place and work out the future because they still have the capacity to do so. With early detection the quality of life of people with dementia as well as their families and carers, as I said, is often dramatically increased. It gives families that opportunity to make plans and arrangements for the future, something that we can all appreciate is incredibly difficult for all involved.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">As elegantly stated by the chair of the committee, the member for Shortland, a very effective way to promote early diagnosis is to promote greater awareness of dementia. This is so very true and so very important. We heard this evidence and had this advice given to us at every stage of the inquiry—that early diagnosis is so important. An effective way to promote early diagnosis is to promote greater awareness of dementia. If we do this, we can ensure that friends and relatives recognise those very early signs. This will help to promote a dementia-friendly society.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We heard that when people see those early signs and talk to their GPs very often it is just brushed aside as 'getting older' and that as you get older you forget things. But these are signs and we need to ensure that GPs and other people in health services are well aware of the early signs. A dementia-friendly community involves taking an holistic approach to care, support and treatment. It is all about, as I said, educating not just GPs but the health industry, the community sector and support groups so as to enable them to better care for people with dementia and provide assistance to their carers. It is all about ensuring that the community continues to value Australians with dementia as well. One of the greatest barriers to improving outcomes for patients remains that stigma that is still attached and that many feel when discussing dementia with their families and friends. In fact, we heard evidence that even GPs associate with that stigma and will sometimes just brush symptoms aside as someone getting older or forgetful, without really looking deeper into the symptoms that patients present with. That means that many people do not seek early treatment from health professionals and end up with outcomes much worse than if they had.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Another common barrier is that many people still believe that dementia is just a natural part of the ageing process. As a result, they do not discuss their dementia with their doctor, their family or their friends. Vice versa, their family and friends do not discuss it with them or with other health professionals since they do not believe anything can be done to delay the onset or to slow the progression of this disease. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">In its report, the committee has also called for a national awareness campaign aimed at dispelling the myths about dementia, ensuring that people recognise the symptoms of dementia and encouraging people experiencing those symptoms to seek a full assessment. There are assessments which can be done to determine whether someone is suffering from signs of early onset dementia. If we can achieve this timely diagnosis of dementia and provide people with the necessary tools, skills, treatment and support, we will go a long way towards improving the quality of life for many older Australians. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">During the inquiry, we travelled to different parts of the nation. At one point the committee visited a place called Norman House in my electorate of Hindmarsh. Norman House is a day care centre for people who suffer from dementia.</span>

                    </a>  It is a fantastic facility. It is at the cutting edge and is one of the best facilities I have seen. It helps people to continue within a community group while giving their families the respite they require. We saw their activities—people meeting, cooking, eating and drinking in a normal household environment. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I was also lucky enough, a few months ago whilst we were still conducting the inquiry, to be invited by ECH to open Seasiders in Laidlaw Street, Henley Beach, which is also in my electorate. Seasiders is another great facility catering for people who have early onset dementia. It provides everything from physiotherapy to community activities in which families can participate. We saw many of these facilities around the country. One that comes to mind was in the member for Shortland's electorate.</span>

                    </a>  Yes, that is right—East Lake Macquarie Dementia Service. We conducted a public hearing of the inquiry at that facility as part of our visit there. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The number of Australians with dementia will quadruple by 2050. That will be a large number of Australians with this disease. This inquiry has made recommendations which should be implemented by governments—both current and future governments—to ensure we have in place the facilities and services we need to deal with the growing number of people with dementia. I commend this report to the House.</span>

                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Swan</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">16:38</span>):  The report <span style="font-style:italic;">Thinking ahead: </span><span style="font-style:italic;">r</span><span style="font-style:italic;">epo</span><span style="font-style:italic;">rt on the inquiry into dementia:</span><span style="font-style:italic;"> early diagnosis and intervention</span> is the culmination of 15 months work by the House of Representatives Standing Committee on Health and Ageing. We have just heard from the previous chair, the member for Hindmarsh. I thank him as well as the chair and the other committee members who worked on this report and who have helped make sure that this was a memorable report. It is a report which I think will go a long way towards assisting those who suffer the symptoms of early onset Alzheimer's. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This is the ninth report by the House of Representatives Standing Committee on Health and Ageing to be tabled in this 43rd Parliament. As this will be the final opportunity to speak on matters pertaining to that committee in the 43rd Parliament, I will, before moving on to the body of the report, make a general point regarding the status of those reports. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Members would be aware that one of the key roles of committees is not only to investigate and report on matters but also to put recommendations to the government of the day. It is the duty of the government of the day to provide a response to reports that contain recommendations within a six-month time frame. Of the nine inquiry reports handed down by the health and ageing committee during the 43rd Parliament, this is the seventh that requires a government response to its recommendations. However, unfortunately, to date the government has not responded to any of these reports tabled by the committee over the last three years. Three of these reports in particular are well beyond the six-month time frame, with the youth suicide report the most outstanding. That was a report that I initiated and it was tabled on 4 July 2011. Having taken a particular interest in the youth suicide report on behalf of the youth suicide charity Youth Focus, in my electorate of Swan, I am particularly keen to see these recommendations considered and responded to. A two-year delay is not good enough.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I am, as I know the member for Shortland is, a supporter of the committee system operated by the parliament. Since 2010, members of the health and ageing committee have completed reports containing 107 recommendations to the government. These reports include ones on early intervention programs aimed at preventing youth suicide, registration processes and support for overseas trained doctors, a round table on polio and postpolio syndrome, adhesive arachnoiditis, health issues across international borders, adult dental services and, today, early diagnosis and intervention in dementia. As I often mention when we table these reports, members of the public invest their time and themselves in the process and sometimes the testimonies take great personal courage. These people deserve prompt responses from the government of the day to the effort they have made to contribute to these reports.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">As a deputy chair I receive many emails and calls from participants, particularly in relation to the overseas trained doctors inquiry, the arachnoiditis round table report and the youth suicide report, inquiring as to when the government will respond. I am sure that the chair receives these phone calls also; during discussion with her, she has also indicated her disappointment at the lack of response by the government of the day. I am sure the chair shares my frustration. I ask that she do all she can to secure responses from the government to the outstanding inquiries and reports before this parliament ends.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">One of the great elements of these committees is that much of the work that is conducted is conducted in a bipartisan spirit, and I know that the member for Shortland, who is the chair, and all the members of the committee are concerned only for the work and the recommendations this committee has produced. I understand the need for the government to thoroughly consider these reports, but the government should really be doing better and I want to take this opportunity today to publicly state my concern in the House.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Having done that, I now turn to the report before the House—the report on dementia. This report has 17 recommendations for consideration by the government and I can say at the outset that I was particularly pleased to focus on this area, given my interest in the aged-care system in general. It is fair to say that many of the issues around dementia do feed into the aged-care system eventually. I have significant aged-care facilities in my electorate of Swan and have held many events there over previous years around the subject of the aged-care crisis.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This issue, once again, has the implications of a major problem which I do not believe has been adequately addressed by the government in the parliament. As the chair said, Australia's population is ageing, and over the next 20 years the number of people with dementia is predicted to more than double. Most members know someone who has suffered or is suffering from dementia. My mother, as we started work on this report, was placed in a dementia ward in Croydon in Victoria and is being very well looked after in that facility—but, as I said, this is an affliction or condition that many people are affected by, and many people in this place would know someone who has been affected by dementia.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">To give some idea of the extent of the issue, it is estimated by Deloitte Access Economics that there were 266,574 people with dementia in 2011 and, assuming no change in the medications available to treat dementia, this number is projected to increase to 553,285 people by 2030 and almost 1,000,000 by 2050. So we need to do two things: we need to invest in the medical sciences, to give the scientists the best chance of finding ways to delay the onset of this disease and, ultimately, to prevent it entirely—and in my speech yesterday I spoke about the work of Professor Martins from Edith Cowan University in Perth—and we need to plan to manage this disease into the future. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">That is what this inquiry was all about. The terms of reference for the inquiry asked the committee to inquire into the early diagnosis and intervention aspects of dementia, with a particular focus on how that can:</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-SmallBullet" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">

                </p>
                <p class="HPS-SmallBullet" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-SmallBullet">increase opportunities for continued social engagement and community participation for people with dementia;</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-SmallBullet" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">

                  <span class="HPS-SmallBullet">how best to deliver awareness and communication on dementia and dementia-related services into the community.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">In response, the committee has endorsed 17 recommendations, and I want to go into some more detail on the issues of awareness and postdiagnosis in particular here today.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">It is obviously extremely important, if we are going to secure more early diagnoses, that people are made aware of the signs at the earliest stage. It is not just the awareness of friends and family that we need to focus on. One of the biggest problems and barriers to early intervention is that patients do not want to admit that they have a problem in the first instance and they avoid seeing their GP. That is obviously an extremely difficult time for anyone with dementia, and I am sure that members will have stories of people they know who are struggling with and, in some cases, resisting the realisation that they may have some form of dementia. This is perpetuated by the misconception that there is nothing that can be done to delay the onset or to assist with the symptoms of dementia, but this is not the case. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Although the report did not go deep into much of the science surrounding the benefits of early diagnosis, it was generally agreed at a broad level that early intervention had a number of clinical benefits in addition to non-clinical benefits. The Australian General Practice Network gave evidence that these benefits included the potential to:</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-SmallBullet" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-SmallBullet">treat the reversible causes of dementia</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-SmallBullet" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-SmallBullet">help slow the progression of dementia through pharmaceutical and lifestyle interventions</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-SmallBullet" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-SmallBullet">support symptom management through pharmaceutical and lifestyle interventions (many of which are likely to be more effective earlier in the course of disease progression) and minimise the impact of symptoms, for example through the establishment of routines that can help patients and families manage declining cognitive function.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">If we can get the message out that treatment and early intervention makes a big difference in terms of clinical outcomes to the quality of life, then this might make it significantly easier for patients to come forward. But we also need to factor GPs into this equation, as evidence given to the committee suggested that some GPs are unaware of some of the clinical benefits of early intervention. Mrs Fiona Young, a clinical nurse consultant in Tasmania, said in her evidence:</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">For health professionals there needs to be awareness too. We cannot assume that because people are health professionals they have a good understanding of dementia because it is a specialised area. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Mr Jack Sach of Alzheimer's Australia Victoria told the committee that dementia was often not well recognised by GPs due to a lack of training, saying:</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">Many GPs are not well trained in the application of cognitive screens such as the mini-mental and so forth. Many GPs have difficulty just keeping pace with the latest science in this area, which is very, very rapid at the moment. Some GPs may be reluctant to refer to specialists, hence there is misdiagnosis occurring. Many GPs do not fully appreciate the services that are available and therefore do not refer on.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">On the question of awareness, a key part of early diagnosis, the committee focused its recommendations not only on the need for the Department of Health and Ageing to engage in a general awareness campaign but also on the need for the development of a national evidence-based dementia training program for GPs with an emphasis on early diagnosis.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The second set of issues considered in this report that I wanted to make a comment on is around the question of postdiagnosis. One theme that came through strongly was that doctors tend to provide much of the information to the patients on management of dementia at the time of diagnosis. This is a difficult time for a couple of reasons, the first being that most patients are obviously fairly distressed at receiving the news and are not in the best position to be thinking abut treatment options.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The second reason is explained in the CDAMS submission: with earlier diagnosis, clients and families are often not ready for or in need of services at the point of diagnosis. They tend to manage initially and, apart from some contact with their GP, are not connected to the service system. Information, provided at the time of diagnosis about available supports and contacts, can be lost at this time and they often remain outside the service system  until a crisis occurs. One way of potentially addressing this issue is a series of guidelines for referral, which was the subject of recommendation 10, and there may be some role for the Department of Health and Ageing here.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Recommendation 11 goes on to suggest that:</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">The Australian Government establish clear and streamlined local referral pathways for dementia diagnosis, treatment and support, through Medicare Locals, localised primary health networks or other specialist dementia networks such as memory clinics.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This was taken a step further with consideration of a potential dementia link-worker program—the idea being that a key worker assist to manage an individual patient's case and link them in with the appropriate services. This is an idea that has been seriously advocated by the Alzheimer's Association, and their CEO, Mr Glenn Ross, put this case to the committee. There was a suggestion that such a program could be linked to any federal aged-care legislation and delivered by existing aged-care provider organisations or community organisations such as Alzheimer's Australia or Medicare Locals.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">There is no doubt that this would be a terrific initiative; however, with projections that over half a million people will have dementia by 2030 in Australia, there will certainly be some logistical issues to consider. The committee has therefore recommended that the Department of Health and Ageing examine the case for establishing a dementia link worker program to assist in the ongoing case management of people with dementia and their carers.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">In conclusion, this report is one that I think the committee should be proud of and I would like to thank all my fellow committee members. One of the things that came out of the report, which I have not mentioned in my speech was stigma, which the member for Hindmarsh mentioned. A lot of people are afraid of the diagnosis because of the stigma that is perceived to be attached to having Alzheimer's or dementia. In some of the inquiry hearings we heard that some people were more afraid of being diagnosed with Alzheimer's or dementia than they were of death, which is a horrible way to look at things because we have moved on with the ability to help and treat these people and given them a better pathway and a better life after diagnosis.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">As well, one of the areas that I have not touched on is the problem as to financial assistance or legal obligations for people who are diagnosed, making sure that their carers and/or their families are made aware of all of the potential issues that come with the diagnosis of Alzheimer's in that some people have been the subject of what was probably some unscrupulous carers in the area. I am sure that we would like to make sure that that does not occur too often. Again, I would like to thank the committee and I look forward to the next parliament and working on the committee again with my fellow committee members. I commend the report to the House.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Small">This number is expected to increase by one third to 400,000 in less than ten years … </span>

                  <span class="HPS-Small">Without a medical breakthrough, the number of people with dementia is expected to be almost 900,000 by 2050.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Dementia is a leading cause of death in Australia. In 2010, the most recent year for which the data is available, it was the third most common cause of death.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Dementia is not a single condition, rather it is an umbrella term that encompasses a range of conditions that affect memory, thinking, behaviour and ability to perform everyday tasks. Characteristics of dementia involve impairment of brain functions, including speech, memory, perception, personality and cognitive skills. Its onset is typically gradual and progressive—in that as the condition develops, the patient deteriorates and it is irreversible. For the majority of people with dementia, assistance will eventually be required for activities such as making decisions, managing relationships, coping with feelings or emotions, and undertaking cognitive or emotional tasks.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Although dementia occurs more commonly in older people, contrary to popular belief it is not an inevitable or 'normal' part of the ageing process. Dementia has wide-ranging implications for carers, families and friends of people living with the condition. In my home state of Tasmania, the Wicking Dementia Research and Education Centre is at the forefront of research and support for individuals, their families and carers. The Wicking centre is the largest health research group in Tasmania. The success of the Wicking Dementia Research Network, funded initially in 2010 by the UTAS Community Engagement fund, has created greater connectivity between dementia service providers and researchers. I was most pleased to show the Hon. Mark Butler, the Minister for Ageing, the great work they are doing last year when he visited my electorate of Bass.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">It is critical that we support the development of a highly educated and skilled workforce and attractive career paths in aged care. Having a skilled workforce is particularly important as the ageing of our population is changing the face of care. Care needs are becoming more complex as people live longer and require care associated with dementia, diabetes and other chronic diseases. These mentor-based clinical placements integrate theory and practice and ensure that the future aged-care, health and medical workforce is equipped with the skills and knowledge to meet the care needs of Tasmania's growing ageing population. Masonic Peace Haven aged-care facility in my electorate of Bass has been closely involved in this program, and I believe it has been a valuable teaching tool for students. I thank the committee for the opportunity to chair our meeting in Launceston. </span>

                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Dementia can happen to anybody, but it is more common in those over the age of 65 years. It is essential that a medical diagnosis is obtained at an early stage when symptoms first appear to ensure that a person who has a treatable condition is diagnosed and treated correctly. If the symptoms are caused by dementia, an early diagnosis will mean early access to support, information and medication and preparations for the rest of their life.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">At present there is no prevention or cure for most forms of dementia. However, some medications have been found to reduce some symptoms. In Launceston we received evidence that shunting—removing fluid—does assist some people. Support is vital for people with dementia and the help of families, friends and carers can make a positive difference in managing the condition.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I wish to place on record my thanks to the late Hazel Hawke, who worked to raise the profile of dementia and the importance of investment in research to improve the quality of dementia care. As Ita Buttrose, President of Alzheimer's Australia, has said, her courage has left a lasting legacy. I thank the secretariat and those who took part in this inquiry, particularly those in my electorate who gave evidence when the committee went to Launceston. This committee is a true reflection of the fact that most members come to this place to do the right thing by the people of Australia.</span>
