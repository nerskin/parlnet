                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Cook</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">11:01</span>):  I rise to speak on the Freedom of Information Amendment (Parliamentary Budget Office) Bill 2012. The Labor Party does not have a clean record when it comes to freedom of information requests. I know this in particular from my own portfolio of immigration. The Office of the Information Commissioner released earlier this month a scathing report into the immigration department's handling of FOI requests under this government's watch, indicating a culture of cover-up and interference by the government. This report exposes Labor's claim of open and transparent government as a fraud. The current Prime Minister's promise to 'let the sunshine in' is about as hollow as the promise that there would be no carbon tax under a government that she leads. The report also raises serious concern within the department about giving the minister a so-called heads-up about what information is being released before making a final decision on an FOI request. This might be how it is done in Sussex Street in New South Wales but it is not how things should operate in an executive government or before this parliament.</span>

                    </a>  Madam Speaker, the minister at the table may wish to reflect on this on his next trip to Darwin. The report raises major questions of political interference in the FOI process relating to Labor's most sensitive political issue: border protection. And the minister at the table took a keen interest in this issue when the boundaries of his own electorate somehow extended to Darwin at the 2010 election when 'the good admiral', as we know him, went up there spruik his claims. The commissioner's report also suggested that the minister for immigration and his office have tried to influence and delay the release of sensitive political information relating to Labor's border protection chaos—which continues to this day. There have been 40 boats and over 2,100 people this month—a record failure that has no equal by any government or any Prime Minister.</span>

                    </a>  The Information Commissioner decided to investigate the immigration department in April following many complaints of missed deadlines and suspected cover-ups, including a complaint made by the member for Mayo about the department obstructing six requests for information relating to the Inverbrackie detention facility.

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">When it comes to open and transparent government Labor's spin is not matched by their actions.

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I turn now to the Parliamentary Budget Office. The Parliamentary Budget Office commenced operations in July this year. Its functions are to prepare election policy costings upon the request of authorised party representatives and independent members of parliament and to prepare policy costings outside of the caretaker period upon the request of individual senators and members of parliament. In addition it will initiate its own work program in anticipation of client requests and also prepare responses to budget related non-policy costing requests of individual senators and members of parliament.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The Parliamentary Budget Office is also tasked with providing formal contributions on request to relevant parliamentary committee inquiries. The Parliamentary Budget Office is an exempt agency under the FOI Act so that its services can be provided on a confidential basis. However, there is no specific exemption for documents related to Parliamentary Budget Office requests that may be held by departments and other agencies, which may therefore not be protected against release under the FOI Act. The purpose of this bill is to amend the FOI Act to provide an exemption for information held by departments and agencies that relates to a confidential request to the Parliamentary Budget Office. It also provides that an agency is not required to give information as to the existence or non-existence of a document where it is exempt under the new provisions. The successful operation of the Parliamentary Budget Office requires that its services be requested and provided on a confidential basis. The integrity of its processes would be compromised if access to requests were available via a backdoor application to non-exempt agencies.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The bill's explanatory memorandum notes that the bill protects public order by enhancing public administration. Specifically the aim of the bill is to protect the integrity of the Parliamentary Budget Office. Maintaining the integrity of the office is an integral element of policy development and public administration. Senators and members may be reluctant to request such analysis from the office in the absence of certainty that information provided in response to confidential requests will not be released under the FOI Act. The aim of this amendment is to provide this assurance. Although existing exemptions may apply to some potential FOI requests relating to Parliamentary Budget Office related documents held by agencies, it cannot be confirmed with certainty that they would apply to all such requests.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Also agencies currently do not have the option of denying or confirming the existence of a confidential Parliamentary Budget Office request. In its submission to the Senate legal and constitutional affairs committee inquiry into this bill, the Parliamentary Budget Office said:</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">… to facilitate its role in undertaking this confidential work for senators and members the Parliamentary Budget Office is an exempt agency under the FOI Act 1982. Without this exemption the Parliamentary Budget Office's effectiveness as a source of confidential budget analyses and policy costings would be seriously compromised. The proposed amendments to the FOI Act extend this logic to also provide an exemption under the FOI Act for information held by departments and agencies that relates to a confidential request to the Parliamentary Budget Office. The Parliamentary Budget Office is heavily reliant on other departments and agencies that relate to a confidential request to the office.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The Office of the Information Commissioner said in its submission that the exemption of the Parliamentary Budget Office would not be fully effective unless there is a similar exemption under the FOI Act for documents held by other agencies that reveal the contents of confidential communications between agencies and the Parliamentary Budget Office. The Information Commissioner did raise in its submission one concern raising the bill:</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">We raise for consideration whether a time limitation should be placed on the operation of the Parliamentary Budget Office exemption. The policy rationale for the exemption is that senators and members of the House of Representatives should have access to independent and non-partisan budget analysis and policy costings over the entire course of the three-year electoral cycle.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The commissioner believes it is not necessary that Parliamentary Budget Office documents should retain their exempt status for 20 years. The commission said a more reasonable limitation may be that the Parliamentary Budget Office exemption continues only for a short period after a general election, perhaps one year. No other concerns have been raised at this stage of the inquiry.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">As I mentioned earlier, the bill has been referred to the Senate legal and constitutional affairs committee for consideration of the adequacy of the scope of the proposed exemption and of any concerns raised, including that of the Information Commissioner. The coalition supports the bill. However, we foreshadow amendments in the Senate pending the Senate committee's final report on 19 November 2012.</span>

                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">
                    <a href="A9B" type="MemberSpeech">
                      <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Mr STEPHEN JONES</span>
                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Throsby</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">11:10</span>):  The Parliamentary Budget Office is a good idea, and it is a good idea that was a long time coming. Put quite simply, the purpose of the Parliamentary Budget Office is to ensure that private members in this place can have their policies and their ideas costed. It means that, if members want to introduce private members' bills and those private members' bills are likely to have a cost associated with them, they are able to go to the PBO to ensure that they are appropriately costed. It means that members of an opposition party who do not have access to all the facilities of the agencies of state can access the Parliamentary Budget Office to ensure that, when they are putting forward policy proposals, those policy proposals can be appropriately costed. It means for the public at large that, when we are having a public debate about a contest of policies, we can do that in the appropriate context, because governments are about ensuring that we distribute scarce resources in the public interest and in the most appropriate way. It ensures that, when we are having those public debates, they include appropriate costings of contested policy ideas, particularly in an election contest when the people of Australia are being asked to make a decision about which side of politics will govern this great nation.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">It is in the interests of the public and it is also in the interests of all members of this place. Had the Parliamentary Budget Office, for example, existed in 1987 when the then Leader of the Opposition John Howard launched the Liberal Party's tax policy for the upcoming election, they would not have been subsequently embarrassed by the fact that there was a $540 million black hole in their costings. They could have, quite simply, accessed the facilities of the Parliamentary Budget Office and presumably that gaping mistake in their costings would have been identified well in advance. So it is in the public and it is also in the good interests of all members of this place.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This legislation is designed to ensure that the Parliamentary Budget Office operates in the way that it was intended to. The purpose of the legislation is to ensure that we have a non-partisan and independent Parliamentary Budget Office, and one that will be used by members of this place.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The bill amends the Freedom of Information Act 1982 to protect the confidentiality of documents held by agencies in relation to confidential requests made to the independent Parliamentary Budget Office. The PBO is currently an exempt agency under the Freedom of Information Act, the FOI Act. It is exempt for good reason. The reason is that members of this place are unlikely to use the Parliamentary Budget Office if they were to think that their requests and submissions to the PBO would then be subject to an FOI discovery. For that reason the PBO is currently an exempt agency under the FOI Act.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">However, the FOI Act does not provide a specific exemption for documents relating to PBO requests that may be held by departments and other agencies. Why would departments and other agencies have these documents in relation to FOI requests? Quite simply, a member, let's say the Leader of the Opposition, approaches the Parliamentary Budget Office for a request on some costings around some of their policy proposals. The PBO under its charter is able to make requests of a government agency to get information in relation to those requests. Under the law as it currently stands those requests may be FOI-able.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">So, the purpose of this legislation is to ensure that you cannot do through the back door what is prohibited through the front door. It is currently prohibited through the front door that the PBO be subject to an FOI request, and what this legislation does is ensure that you cannot get that information through the back door by going directly to a government agency and cleverly crafting an FOI request which would cough up those otherwise prohibited documents.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The legislation will enhance the integrity of the independence of the PBO process, which is something that should be welcomed by all members of this place. It will further strengthen Australia's fiscal and budgetary frameworks by ensuring that information is protected and that independent advice can be given on budget, fiscal and financial implications of proposals of private members in this place.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">As a consequence of this amendment, the bill also amends section 25 of the FOI Act to provide that an agency is not required to give information as to the existence or non-existence of a document where it is exempt under the new exemption for documents that relate to a confidential request to the PBO. It is not hard to imagine why this might be a necessary and important consequential amendment. It would be quite possible to craft an FOI request if you knew the proposals were being costed or, indeed, not being costed. It would be possible to craft an FOI request to a government agency and then either the existence of non-existence of that document could provide great political mileage to a person in this place who wanted to expose or embarrass the proponent of a particular policy proposal. Indeed, members of our esteemed media who report on the goings-on of this place might also seek to make a request similarly crafted for similar purposes. It is a sensible amendment to ensure that you cannot do through the back door what is prohibited and intended to be prohibited through the front door.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The bill also includes amendments to section 34 of the Privacy Act which provide that the commissioner, in carrying out functions under the Privacy Act—for example, investigating an act or practice of an agency that may be a breach of privacy—must not give a person any information as to the existence or non-existence of a document where it is exempt under the FOI Act. It is proposed to amend section 34 to refer to the new PBO exemption reflecting the amendment to section 25 of the FOI Act and ensuring that PBO documents are confidential.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The bill will operate retrospectively from the day after introduction. Retrospective legislation should be rare and this subject matter is one of those rare occasions when it is appropriate to ensure that discoveries of documents cannot reach back into the past to the beginning of the operations of the PBO, given that it was the intention of all members of this place that the discovery of such documents should not be available. The bill's limitation of the right of individuals to receive confidential information is reasonable and proportionate to its objective of protecting the integrity of the PBO and enhancing public administration.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">These amendments, together with the crafting of the substantive legislation, are all aimed at a singular public purpose, and that is to ensure that, after establishing the Parliamentary Budget Office, funding it and ensuring that it is adequately funded to perform its purpose, it is actually used. All members of this place should see that it is in the public interest that a contestant in the political process should not be able to go to an election or go through three years of an electoral cycle and be able to put up policy proposals that are not adequately costed, inappropriately costed, or wilfully inappropriately costed, to escape public and parliamentary scrutiny. This bill will ensure that that public purpose is furthered—to encourage all members of this place to use the Parliamentary Budget Office. It is consistent with many of the reforms that we have introduced since Labor was elected to office in 2007.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">To hear the shadow minister recently take a swipe at the record of this government in relation to our practice under freedom of information laws beggars belief, quite frankly. It is the equivalent of Colonel Sanders calling for vegetarianism. Their approach to FOI when in government was something that experts, members of the media and all right-thinking members in this place looked on with great scorn. You need look no further than their practice of using conclusive certificates as an example. This is relevant to the legislation before the House—because it is relevant to ensure that this legislation, which is directed at ensuring appropriate scrutiny of public policy proposals, is facilitated.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">That is the complete opposite of what we saw under the previous government. The opposition spokesperson who spoke just recently on this issue was a member of that government. They scattered these conclusive certificates, which are designed for the sole purpose of precluding public scrutiny of policy proposals by the government, around like confetti. Then we hear a member of the opposition—a member of the Liberal Party—stand up here and make some snide comment about our commitment to freedom of information, when we put in place the greatest overhaul of the freedom of information laws as well as arrangements to ensure that the FOI laws work in relation to the operations of this place and the operations of government in exactly the way they are intended to—in the public interests of transparency. It stands head and shoulders above the operation and provision of any government in the history of this parliament. So the proposition by members opposite that somehow we are not committed to the reform of FOI and to ensuring that the legislation operates in the way it was intended cannot stand unchallenged.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Our FOI laws are good and proper, and the reforms that are being proposed by this bill are good legislation. The legislation is aimed at ensuring that the Parliamentary Budget Office operates in the way it was intended. Perhaps I can conclude by making this remark. Having funded and established the budget office, it is now incumbent on all members of this place to use it, to ensure that we do not have the embarrassing spectacle of parties or individuals going to an election with uncosted or inappropriately costed policy proposals. As a result of these reforms and of the legislation that was put in place by this government, there will now be no excuse for them not to use it. I commend the legislation to the House.</span>

                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Moreton</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">11:23</span>):  I rise to speak to the Freedom of Information Amendment (Parliamentary Budget Office) Bill 2012 and particularly commend the member for Throsby on his contribution to the debate. I know he has a long history with this, because of his time with the CPSU, who would have covered many of the members who deal with freedom of information requests. So his words, particularly on the conclusive certificates, were particularly useful, and I will not go over the information he put forward in his speech.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Freedom of information is crucial for good government. That is the reality of a modern democracy. And I say this as a member of the Labor Party: I am passionate about democracy. Whilst I wear a Labor Party hat and am proud to be part of the Labor caucus, my faith and belief in democracy transcends that. FOI laws, which can be traced back to the Hawke-Keating time, are a particularly Labor initiative in terms of embracing the transparency that comes with good government. I say that as someone who comes from Queensland, where Premier Wayne Goss was instrumental in bringing dramatic transformation of the Queensland approach to the public service, and FOI is an important part of that.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Unfortunately I grew up in a time when Joh Bjelke-Petersen had a very cavalier approach to democracy. We had the gerrymander; we had infringement of civil rights; we had a very closed-shop approach to what democracy was. Sadly, today, in Queensland we have drifted back to some of those bad old days of Joh Bjelke-Petersen. However, the bill in front of us is about amending the Freedom of Information Act 1982, the Commonwealth legislation to protect the confidentiality of documents held by agencies in relation to the confidential requests made to the independent Parliamentary Budget Office.</span>

                    </a>  Not interested? It is close by anyway. Obviously the PBO is currently an exempt agency under the FOI Act. However, the FOI Act does not provide specific exemption for documents relating to PBO requests that may be held by departments and other agencies. As a result, requests for information made to agencies by the PBO and information provided to the PBO by agencies may not be protected. So perhaps this has been a reason why the opposition have not been prepared to take their policies over there to be costed. In order to avoid any chance that that would put them off, the bill before us will enhance the integrity of the independent PBO processes. Essentially the bill will further protect the confidentiality of the Parliamentary Budget Office's work and will strengthen Australia's fiscal and budget frameworks. This means that MPs can now be confident that the PBO will give independent and protected advice on the budget and financial proposals that they put forward to the people.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I have great faith in the independence of Australia's public servants and in Queensland public servants. I do not just say that because I am married to one of those public servants in Queensland, who has worked for a variety of state governments over the last 22 years. She served the National Party government under Joh Bjelke-Petersen, she served Wayne Goss, she served Rob Borbidge—and I think I have left off a National Party premier or two in between there—and also Peter Beattie, Anna Bligh and now Campbell Newman. Like every public servant, she does not serve a party; she serves the public. She gives advice. She acts independently and makes the decisions that are in the best interests of the public. I would hope that my premier in Queensland would recognise that public servants do have that great facility to be smart and clever and give frank and fearless advice and serve the state or the nation.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Sadly, we have nearly 14,000 Queenslanders lose their jobs in the context of 26,000 Queenslanders losing their jobs since Campbell Newman became Premier. It is not a good time to be looking for work in Queensland, sadly. Naturally, the bill before the chamber raises this question: when will the shadow Treasurer come clean and show the Australian public how he intends to fund his $70 billion black hole, which was exposed after the last election? He came clean the other day by indicating that he is going to rip off Australian families and get rid of the schoolkids bonus, even though we are about to give payments out in January to all of the parents in my electorate. The shadow Treasurer said this on <span style="font-style:italic;">Lateline </span>on 23 October: 'So we've also previously said we're going to abolish the schoolkids bonus. It's on the record that we're not going to proceed with the schoolkids bonus.' That will be a horrible situation for the families in my electorate in January. They would not receive a payment if the member for North Sydney were in power. He is saying, 'No schoolkids bonus.'</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The Liberal Party and the National Party are yet again showing their true colours, promising to cut payments that assist local families with the costs of putting their kids through school. Without the schoolkids bonus, a typical family in Moreton putting two kids through school would lose more than $15,000 over the course of their children's education. The schoolkids bonus means every local family on family tax benefit part A will receive $410 a year for primary school kids and $820 a year for kids in secondary school.</span>

                    </a>  Thank you, Mr Deputy Speaker. Obviously, this is about funding election policies and how the Parliamentary Budget Office would accurately assess those. They will be able to do it independently by not being subject to scrutiny under freedom of information legislation. I know that you were not sitting in the chair when I started this wonderful discourse, Mr Deputy Speaker. But I am happy to take you to the <span style="font-style:italic;">Hansard </span>later on. I will return to the legislation in front of us.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Obviously, the legislation before the chamber is about increasing the protection for and privacy of any request made of the Parliamentary Budget Office, whether it is by the Greens, by Independent members, by the Liberal Party or by the National Party. It is about making sure that there is good government. It will make sure that if you have a policy such as a parental leave scheme—and maybe you have not consulted with your caucus about it because you seek forgiveness for rather than consultation on such a policy—where you are giving parental leave to people earning $150,000 a year, you can have that policy looked at by the Parliamentary Budget Office and know that the costings and advice given by that office will not be subject to FOI, even if it is a Coles and Woolies tax, for example. This legislation will make sure that we have good and honest government. I commend the bill to the House.</span>

                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Gellibrand</span>—<span class="HPS-MinisterialTitles">Attorney-General and Minister for Emergency Management</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">11:33</span>):  I would like to thank honourable members for their contributions to the debate on the Freedom of Information Amendment (Parliamentary Budget Office) Bill 2012. The Parliamentary Budget Office is an important new office that has been established to provide members of parliament with independent and non-partisan advice on the budget cycle, fiscal policy and the financial implications of policy processes over the entire course of the three-year electoral cycle.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This marks a significant departure from the previous arrangements, particularly for non-government parties, who previously under the Charter of Budget Honesty Act were only able to have their publicly announced polices costed during the caretaker period. The bill also represents a new service for Independent members of parliament and parties with fewer than five members, who previously had no access to independent costings. A key element of the new arrangements is that outside of the caretaker period for a general election a senator or member can request the Parliamentary Budget Office to provide services on a confidential basis for policy costings.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">When it was set up, the Parliamentary Budget Office was made an exempt agency under the Freedom of Information Act of 1982. However, the FOI Act does not currently provide a specific exemption for documents related to requests to the Parliamentary Budget Office that may be held by departments and other agencies. The possibility of public disclosure of the fact that the Parliamentary Budget Office has undertaken work on a confidential request represents a potentially serious barrier to the use of the services of the Parliamentary Budget Office by senators and members. This bill amends the FOI Act to provide an exemption for information held by departments and agencies that relates to a confidential request to the Parliamentary Budget Office.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The amendments will protect the confidentiality of the work of the Parliamentary Budget Office and will ensure that it operates as intended, with the parliament expressly exempting the Parliamentary Budget Office from the FOI Act. I welcome the opposition's support for this bill and commend it to the House.</span>
                </p>

                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Casey</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">11:36</span>):  I rise to speak on behalf of the shadow Treasurer and member for North Sydney on the Superannuation Legislation Amendment (New Zealand Arrangement) Bill 2012. Let me say at the outset that the coalition will support this bill. The bill seeks to enact the Trans-Tasman Retirement Savings Portability Scheme memorandum of understanding, which permits transfers of retirement savings between Australian APRA regulated superannuation funds and New Zealand KiwiSaver funds. The coalition supports initiatives such as this that strengthen the relationship that we share with New Zealand and also extend these benefits to citizens of not only our country but of New Zealand as well.</span>

                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The 2011 census revealed that just over nine per cent of all overseas born persons living in Australia were of New Zealand descent, coming in at just over 483,000. New Zealand came in second behind the United Kingdom, which had the highest proportion of overseas born persons living in Australia at just over 1.1 million people. These statistics reveal just how close the ties are between our country and our Tasman neighbour, with Australia's population above 22 million.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Once the funds are transferred, the rule of the country into which the funds have been transferred prevail, with some exceptions. Australian sourced retirement savings held in New Zealand KiwiSaver accounts may not be withdrawn to purchase a first home. Australian sourced retirement savings held in a KiwiSaver account may be accessed when an individual reaches age 60 and satisfies the definition of retirement at that age as set out in the Superannuation Industry (Supervision) Regulations 1994. Australian sourced retirement savings held in a KiwiSaver account may not be transferred to a third country.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">New Zealand sourced retirement savings may only be transferred to and held by APRA regulated superannuation funds and may not be transferred to a self-managed superannuation fund. New Zealand sourced retirement savings held in Australia will not be able to be accessed until the age of retirement as defined in the New Zealand Superannuation and Retirement Income Act of 2001. Finally, New Zealand sourced retirement savings held in Australia may not be transferred to a third country. Due to the exceptions that I have just mentioned, the transferred funds must be separately identifiable once the funds have been moved.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">As I said at the outset, the coalition welcomes this legislation. However, we note that the New Zealand government acted promptly on this agreement, with their legislation receiving assent back in September 2010.</span>

                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Unfortunately, it has taken this government two years to bring this relatively simple bill to the parliament. This is a delay that the parliament is used to. The coalition would have expected to see these changes brought before the parliament a lot sooner.</span>

                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The only other remarks I will make on behalf of the shadow Treasurer in relation to this bill centre around the fact that no explanation has been provided in the explanatory memorandum or the agreement as to why New Zealand residents cannot transfer their retirement savings into an Australian based self-managed super fund. Absent any evidence to the contrary, it seems that the restriction of transfers to APRA regulated funds has been driven for political rather than policy reasons. The SMSF Professionals' Association of Australia expressed their concerns in relation to this matter in response to the exposure draft of the bill. I will not quote them at length, but they certainly expressed their reservations and, on behalf of the shadow Treasurer, I can say that a future coalition government would seek to consult the New Zealand government with the aim of expanding the Trans-Tasman Retirement Saving Portability Scheme memorandum of understanding to allow for New Zealand sourced retirement savings to be transferred into Australian self-managed superannuation funds. As I said at the outset, on behalf of the shadow Treasurer, the coalition supports the passage of this bill.</span>

As part of our Closer Economic Relations, the CER, and single economic market initiatives with New Zealand in 2007, a working group was established to consider options for the portability of retirement savings between Australia and New Zealand. In 2009 the government and the New Zealand government signed a memorandum of understanding to develop the Trans-Tasman Retirement Savings Portability Scheme. The scheme enables Australians and New Zealanders to take their superannuation with them when they move from one country to the other. As we all know, there are many exchanges between our countries. The bill benefits Australians and New Zealanders who move from one country to the other and who wish to take their superannuation with them. </span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">More than 50,000 New Zealanders move to Australia each year, while there are about 14,000 people that leave Australia permanently to take up residency in New Zealand. The measure will assist individuals to streamline their financial affairs when they move between the two countries, consolidate their superannuation in the country of residence and avoid paying fees and charges on multiple accounts held in the two countries. The scheme will also assist Australian superannuation funds by removing small or inactive accounts belonging to former members now living in New Zealand from the Australian superannuation system. The scheme removes an impediment to labour mobility between Australia and New Zealand and enhances the development of a seamless trans-Tasman labour market.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The scheme is an important step in Australia's Closer Economic Relations with New Zealand and supports ongoing progress towards a single economic market. Both governments are committed to this goal through the Australia-New Zealand Closer Economic Relations trade agreement. This is the first time an international superannuation portability scheme has been implemented in Australia, so it is indeed a landmark development and a historic one at that.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I understand that the commencement of this scheme has been welcomed on both sides of the Tasman Sea, including by two key Australian super industry bodies—the Association of Superannuation Funds of Australia and the Australian Institute of Superannuation Trustees. There has also been significant interest and attention in New Zealand welcoming the progress of the Australian legislation and the commencement of this scheme once the legislation has passed. </span>

It benefits Australia and it benefits New Zealand. It is supported on both sides of this House and I commend the bill to the House.</span>

                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Robertson</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">11:45</span>):  This is a very important piece of legislation that is part of a suite of significant reforms in the superannuation area that this government is undertaking. I am pleased that those on the other side are also here articulating their support for the Superannuation Legislation Amendment (New Zealand Arrangement) Bill 2012. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">As the parliamentary secretary has indicated, Australia absolutely is committed to the closest possible relations with New Zealand government. In fact, the moment that we are now at is a natural development of a long-term and sustained relationship. As early as the 1920s there were significant formal arrangements between our two countries to ensure and facilitate the free flow of people between both New Zealand and Australia. The landmark 1973 trans-Tasman travel arrangement has allowed Australian and New Zealand citizens to enter each other's country to visit, live and work without the need to apply for authority to enter the other country before travelling. Obviously that has enhanced the movement of New Zealand citizens to and from Australia and this has enhanced, I would argue, the economic conditions of both countries.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The number of New Zealand citizens in Australia certainly increases when economic times in Australia are good relative to New Zealand and decreases when the economy slows. The capacity to have people moving in and out of our labour market to enhance our own economic growth is a very sound arrangement that benefits the people of both our nations. At the heart of all of our legislation should be that consistent concern for the benefit of people.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">As of 30 June there were approximately 647,000 New Zealand citizens present in Australia. This piece of legislation attends to that significant number of people who want to be able to ensure their retirement funds are safe. In considering the options for a portability retirement savings scheme between Australia and New Zealand, a formal working group was established in 2007. By 2009 both the Australian government and the New Zealand government had signed a memorandum of understanding to develop the Trans-Tasman Retirement Savings Portability Scheme.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">To all those people who were involved in articulating a vision of what was possible and then preparing the necessary documentation—making agreements with relevant authorities to ensure a sound and safe and just structure—this is a red-letter day. It is an achievement of a goal that has been sought for some time by people with that interest. Essentially what this legislation will enable Australians and New Zealanders to do—and I want to stress that this is a voluntary thing—is take their superannuation from one country to the other. If someone wants to move their superannuation, this legislation will benefit that.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">In terms of movement across our two countries, more than about 50,000 New Zealanders move to Australia each year and about 14,000 leave Australia to live permanently in New Zealand. When you are making such an important decision for the benefit of your family, obviously you would want to be able to be sure that there was a great deal of probity around it. This piece of legislation, at the end of a long period of consultation, has ensured that individuals will be able to streamline their financial affairs when they undertake a significant movement of their life and their family from one of these two great nations that formed the ANZUS Treaty and served so valiantly in the cause of freedom over many years as Anzacs.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">As I said at the beginning of my commentary, this is just part of a suite of significant improvements and streamlining of superannuation capacity for Australians—and in this case to the benefit of New Zealanders as well. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This government has increased the superannuation guarantee from nine to 12 per cent, we have introduced low-income superannuation contributions—effective from 1 July this year—we also implemented a one-off refund of small excess concessional-contribution cap breach from 1 July 2011, and the superannuation guarantee for people who are 70 years of age, as a limit, will be abolished as of 1 July 2013.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I commend this bill as part of a significant suite of important reforms that have outcomes delivered by a determination to improve and enhance the life outcomes for Australians, and in this case New Zealanders as well. I certainly understand that the legislation and the commencement of this scheme have been welcomed by the governments and the people on both sides of the great Tasman Sea. I am pleased to report that ASFA, the Association of Superannuation Funds of Australia, and the Australian Institute of Superannuation Trustees have also indicated that they welcome this legislation. I understand that the New Zealand press has been particularly welcoming of the progress of this legislation and the commencement of this scheme, once the legislation is passed, and with those words I commend the bill to the House.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This bill introduces a scheme to allow the transfer of superannuation between New Zealand and Australia. Currently, Australians and New Zealanders working in Australia cannot transfer their superannuation when they leave Australia permanently; it must remain in their Australian superannuation fund until they are eligible to claim it, usually on retirement. The new scheme will permit individuals who move both ways across the Tasman to take their superannuation with them. Australians moving to New Zealand may transfer their superannuation to a New Zealand KiwiSaver scheme, New Zealanders moving to Australia may transfer their KiwiSaver benefits to their Australian superannuation fund. In this way many thousands of people will be able to consolidate their retirement savings in their country of residence. They will no longer have to pay fees and charges on accounts held in two countries. There are 483,000 people who were born in New Zealand who now live in Australia. This will be a marvellous development for those people. Superannuation funds will benefit from the removal of small or inactive accounts from the Australian superannuation system. These are accounts that belong to people who no longer live in Australia and who are no longer making contributions to their Australian fund.</span>

                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Dunkley</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">11:54</span>):  I rise to speak on the Tax Laws Amendment (2012 Measures No.5) Bill 2012. The coalition has a number of amendments to this legislation, which I understand the government is quite sympathetic to. My parliamentary colleague the member for Groom will be detailing those in much greater sophistication than I am able to at this time. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The bill does a number of things. It  deals with the conservation tillage refund tax offset and some amendments to the definition about what is an eligible no-till seeder. It also phases out the mature-age worker tax offset, something I am particularly alert to, having been involved with the development of what was known as the mature age employment advantage in my electorate, where men and women over the age of 45 were finding it particularly challenging entering the workforce.</span>
                </p>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Through a local initiative that we organised through the Peninsula Job Team, we were able to bring together a range of providers to help mature-age people to re-enter the workforce with encouragement, which ultimately led to Prime Minister Howard announcing the mature-age worker tax offset in my electorate.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">There are also some provisions dealing with gaseous fuels, and I am pleased that the coalition continues to be highly alert and receptive to the concerns of the LP gas industry, and the gaseous fuel industry more generally, about the impact of tax and compliance regimes on this important part of the economy. I am delighted that the member for Groom has arrived, and I might conclude my remarks at that point and thank the House for accepting that gripping contribution to the bill.</span>

                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Groom</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">11:55</span>):  Thank you very much, Mr Deputy Speaker—and, as this is my first opportunity at the dispatch box to do so, can I congratulate you on your election to Deputy Speaker. It has been some time coming, but good always prevails and right always comes to the fore.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I will be moving an amendment to this bill in the consideration in detail stage, as circulated, which particularly relates to the LPG component of the bill. I will now speak to that. Whilst the coalition and opposition in general supports the amendments proposed under the TLAB, we certainly do not support the sections of the bill as they relate to the introduction of a huge compliance cost, particularly to small business, in relation to the taxation and the levying of an excise on gaseous fuels. These fuels are LPG, LNG, CNG—or compressed natural gas. These fuels are of course not only clean-burning fuels, and therefore something that is helpful in terms of the environment—and I would have thought those in government would understand that—but, secondly, these are fuels which Australia is overly endowed with; in fact, we are exporters of these fuels. We export LNG from the North-West Shelf and we have an excess of natural gas in its forms of compressed natural gas and liquefied natural gas. Australia is heading towards being the largest exporter of that gas in the world.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">What we are short of in Australia, unfortunately, is liquid fuel—that is, crude oil or condensate—and so it makes absolutely no sense to me, or to Australians in general, that we introduce an excise on these gaseous fuels, yet this is what the government did last year. So desperate for money are they that they will tax anything that doesn't move, and if it doesn't move they push it and then tax it. We know that they are desperate for cash, we know they spend money day in, day out that they cannot bring back into balance—and, of course, we saw last week with the MYEFO that they are able to actually get themselves in such a position where they are so desperate for money that they are now going to tax businesses, including small businesses with a turnover of $20 million or more. They are going to make them pay their income tax not quarterly but monthly. So they are going to make them pay 14 months' tax in 12 months. This just highlights how out of control the spending is by those who sit opposite us in government.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The requirements and compliance regime being introduced under this TLAB bill and the excise being placed on gaseous fuels by this government is extraordinary red tape. They come into government and say that they are going to ease the compliance burden; but, as we know, all they have done is increase it and increase it and increase it. There is compliance burden on the small businesses that I talk to, whether they are in my hometown of Toowoomba or whether they are in Whyalla where I was last week. Geez, they remember the Minister for Trade there well—not nicely, but they remember him well. I doubt they will ever forget him.</span>

                    </a>  Despite the predictions of the AWU, they are still there. They are just waiting for the return of a decent government that will abolish the carbon tax, abolish the mining tax, ensure that there is a predictable environmental permitting system and ensure that nothing changes so that they do not wake up every morning in Whyalla and find that the government has imposed another new tax. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">What we have in front of us today is a compliance regime which allows—let us call it—John Smith's Tent World to sell LPG, and they have been selling LPG to happy campers for a long time. They now have an enormous compliance burden because, if that LPG is used in transport fuels, they now have to fill out a whole heap of forms to say that it was not. If it happens to be the local BP—and I have a local BP that I use in east Toowoomba—they refuel your car with LPG, if you have got an LPG car, and they also refill your gas cylinders for your barbecue or whatever. Their compliance burden under this bill is enormous, because some of the gaseous fuel they sell will be taxed and some of it will not be. So, rather than just having to report the fuel that is taxed, of course you have to report everything. This is a government that has taken red tape to a new level. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The compliance measures contained in this bill have not been previously announced. The LPG industry, small business and let alone the users of LPG have never been consulted about these compliance measures. Had they been, there would have been a more sensible approach to this measure. If we look at the detail and the complexity of this, we realise that the government has got absolutely no idea of what it is doing with it, other than burdening business with a whole new level of red tape. The government says that this measure is necessary to get around administrative difficulties—which they created. So they create an administrative difficulty by taxing a gaseous fuel that is more environmental friendly than conventional fuels and then they say to small business: 'You not only have to pay in terms of paperwork and red tape but you're to blame. You're the reason we're doing this.' How crazy are they? </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">These amendments are clumsy at best. They go way beyond and are more arduous and stricter than the current Excise Act obligation for conventional fuel sellers and others obliged to collect excise. Let us look at the model. For 100 years or thereabouts, governments have been collecting excises in various forms. We have a model that works. If you sell petrol or you sell distillate or if you sell perhaps a little bit of kerosene—not so much these days—then you have an excise regime which your business has to follow. It works. Everyone is used to it. Everyone understands it. So why don't we use that? No. Far too simple. Nowhere near enough red tape in that. So government is introducing a regime just for gaseous fuels which is far more onerous and far more arduous than the regime that is currently in place. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">It is stated that this legislation will ensure the 2011 alternative legislation on excising gaseous fuel works as is intended. If the intention is to collect excise from businesses for gaseous fuels then we say firstly that that should not have been excised in the first place. We want to encourage the use of fuels for transport that are actually plentiful in this country in order to help our balance of payments and to make public transport cheaper so that we have buses running on CNG and trucks running on CNG and LNG, with less particulates, less pollution in the environment. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">But then comes along the member for Lilley, the Treasurer. If he sees something he will tax it. So he has taxed it and now he has to try and work out how he is going to collect the tax. But, as I say, had he gone to the businesses and asked them how they would do this, this would not have been the way. Under this bill, premises for producing, importing or storing liquid fuels, petrol and diesel, are subject to licensing, and consequently untaxed liquid fuels do not appear in the marketplace. So that system works well. It has been around, as I say, for nearly 100 years. There are automatic remissions to fuel tax where LPG is going to be used for non-transport fuel, but that is after you have done all the paperwork. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">CNG receives an exemption when it enters the marketplace as a non-transport use, but you have to identify that that has happened. It is not assumed that if Joe<span style="&#xD;&#xA;    font-family:Tahoma;&#xD;&#xA;  ">'</span>s Barbecue Shop is selling LPG that he is actually selling LPG for barbecues. You could never assume that, not if you are in government. You actually have to envelope, encase, that business in a pile of red tape to ensure that only those fuels that can be shown not to have been used in transport use are given an exemption. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The intention is that the compliance cost under the proposed regime will be lower than that applying to fuel tax to all gaseous fuels that enter the marketplace with subsequent fuel tax credits where appropriate. The gaseous fuel compliance regime would be based on obligations to maintain and produce appropriate records to provide access to premises, documents and goods. But in reality the government has introduced a layer of complexity not ever seen before in the excising and taxing of transport fuels. There is far more compliance, far more complexity, far more cost for small business and, of course—and here comes the next bit—it is far more difficult to be able to prove that you have done the right thing. So you have to keep your records for five years. You are open to an inspection at any time and under any terms. That places enormous pressure on small businesses not only to have the records but to have them there on site for inspection. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Subject to the following paragraph, schedule 3 is to be opposed because the amendments are more onerous and stricter than the current Excise Act obligations on conventional fuel sellers and others who are obliged to collect excise. We have a proven system; let us use that. Item 20 in part 2 of schedule 3, which will treat a forklift truck used off public roads as not being a motor vehicle for the purpose of the Excise Act is not opposed. They actually got one thing right, and we give them credit for that. We give them credit for actually realising it. I do not know if they have ever driven a forklift, but I have. If you have a forklift you are hardly going to be cutting laps around a city block in Toowoomba. They are there for the removal of produce, usually from the backs of trucks, or for moving produce round a warehouse. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">In other respects, parts 1 and 2 of schedule 3 will increase the red tape burden, especially for small business and LPG, and the existing provisions in the Excise Act regarding record keeping, officials' access to premises and imposition of penalties for the supply of gaseous fuels subject to the fuel tax relief for transport use are amply sufficient. Why is it that this government does not get small business? Why is it, as Kim Beazley said famously once, the Labor Party is not the friend of small business? Why do they see a small business and want to tax it? Why do they see a small business and want to impose red tape? Why do they see a small business and make it harder for that small business to employ people? This is a clear example of what this government does to small business. There is no respect for them, no understanding of them, no understanding of the cost that they are burdening them with. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The coalition will not stand by quietly and watch small business get it in the neck again as a result of this government's incompetence and, of course, their fundamental failure to manage their own money—the fact that every time they look up they have to find a new tax to keep their wild and exorbitant spending in check.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">In conclusion can I say, as I said at the opening, that these measures have not been previously announced. It is stated that the purpose is to ensure that the 2011 alternative fuels legislation works as intended, but I can assure those who sit opposite that if they consult with the coalition—and we accept that we lost the vote last year—with the LPG Association and with small business then we will find a way to make this work under the current compliance regime. We do not need a whole new level of red tape. There are, as I said, specific legislation exemptions—for example, where the duty has been paid at the same rate on each component of the blend—and we continue to work with the government to ensure that that works. Can I just say in conclusion, foreshadowing the amendment, that we are interested in good government. This is not good government.</span>

                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">
                    <a href="A9B" type="MemberSpeech">
                      <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Mr STEPHEN JONES</span>
                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Throsby</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">12:11</span>):  The Tax Laws Amendment (2012 Measures No. 5) Bill 2012 is the fifth tranche of legislation introduced in 2012 for the amendment of our tax laws. It shows that the government is committed to continually adjusting our taxation arrangements to ensure they are appropriate for meeting our revenue targets, to remove loopholes and unintended consequences as they are thrown up, to ensure that they continually operate efficiently and as intended, and to ensure that we meet our commitments to ensure that the tax take, as a proportion of GDP, is no greater than it was when we took office. The opposition spokesperson has recently made some comments about the size of the tax take under this government, but what he will not have told the House is that the highest taxing government in the history of this nation was the Howard government. The only way to measure this is to measure the ratio of tax to GDP. It is at record lows under our government. It was at record highs when we came to office. If you want to look at handing out gold medals for the highest taxing government in the history of Federation, you need look no further than the Howard government. You would not mind so much if they were not spending like drunken sailors at the same time, but that is indeed what they were doing, in stark contrast to those on this side of the House, who have done the hard yards in ensuring that we can find the savings in this year's budget, in the Mid-Year Economic and Fiscal Outlook statement and throughout the course of this year to ensure that we meet our commitments. You hear those on the other side of the House continually claiming that there are savings there to be found, but every time we put a saving up they are the first to be screaming, 'We can't support this.'</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">So I am very pleased to be speaking today on this bill, which contains a number of measures which deal with various taxation issues. Schedule 1 of the bill makes a minor technical change to the conservation tillage refundable tax offset, amending the definition of 'eligible no-till seeder' to ensure that the offset applies to the purchase of just the tool as well as the combination of the cart and the tool. This amendment will assist the government's objective of encouraging the uptake of conservation tillage practices by removing the existing requirement that a new cart also be purchased at the time a new no-till seeding tool is purchased. It follows industry feedback on the current eligibility requirements. It is a measure which should, and I hope will, enjoy the support of all members in this place.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Schedule 2 contains measures to phase out the mature-age worker tax offset, otherwise known as MAWTO, from 1 July 2012 for taxpayers who were not already 55 or older on or before 30 June 2012—that is, those born on or after 1 July 1957.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Those currently eligible because they were aged 55 years or older on 30 June 2012 are unaffected by the change and remain age eligible for the mature-age worker tax offset—that is, the provisions are not retrospective. By closing off the offset to new recipients and investing in better-targeted participation programs, the government will improve the value for money while protecting those who have built the offset into their household budgets.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The offset is a cost to revenue in the order of $450 million per year. It is not an efficient way to promote participation amongst those aged 55 and above. We remain committed to encouraging the retention and the re-entry into the workforce of those mature-age workers. It is estimated that under the existing arrangements, however, only 5,000 full-time-equivalent workers are encouraged into the workforce through the offset. This equates to a cost of about $90,000 per encouraged worker, hardly an efficient tax expenditure. We on this side of the House—and I hope that this is a measure which enjoys the support of all sides of the House—believe that there are more effective and efficient ways of pursuing this worthy aim.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">It is important that the government channels its efforts to encouraging workforce participation among older Australians through more cost-effective programs. The government is introducing a new $26 million Mature Age Participation—Job Seeker Assistance Program, for example, from 1 July 2013 to provide eligible mature-age job seekers aged 55 and over with a peer based environment in which to develop their information technology skills, undertake job-specific training and prepare for work.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The government's $41 million response to the final report of the Advisory Panel on the Economic Potential of Senior Australians includes a $10 million initiative for new jobs bonuses, which will encourage businesses to employ older Australians who want to stay in the workforce—another example of a better-targeted program for assisting the retention and employment of older Australians.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">And then there are the $1,000 bonuses which will be paid to employers who recruit and retain a mature-age job seeker for three months or more. I see the Minister for Employment Participation at the table. It is an excellent initiative, and I congratulate her on the great work that she has done in not only proposing this measure but ensuring that it has survived the rigours of the Expenditure Review Committee.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I also point to the $15.6 million extension of the successful Corporate Champions program to provide support to employers who wish to promote mature-age employment at their workplace. This is a scheme that I know through my work in my electorate has enjoyed a lot of support from the many retired professionals and executives who live in a few parts within my electorate, who have decided that they do not want to continue to participate in a full-time role in the work that they do but would be willing to provide voluntary or more part-time work through a program such as this.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">All of these are excellent examples of how we can better target the assistance from government to employ and retain mature-age Australians.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">There are several other schedules within the bill, most of which have been ventilated in the debate before the House. There is one provision that I will draw your attention to, and that is schedule 5, which amends the list of deductible gift recipients in the Income Tax Assessment Act to add the Diamond Jubilee Trust Australia. The Diamond Jubilee Trust has been established to raise funds in Australia for the commemoration of Her Majesty's diamond jubilee. I am a well-known republican myself, but that does not stop me wanting to support an important initiative such as this, because the purpose of this trust is to provide charitable and aid works in developing countries. It would be churlish of me indeed not to support such a worthwhile initiative.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">These are all important amendments which should enjoy the support of all members in this place. I commend the bill in its entirety to the House.</span>

I begin by thanking all of those members who have contributed to this debate on the Tax Laws Amendment (2012 Measures No. 5) Bill 2012.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Schedule 1 amends the definition of 'eligible no-till seeder' for the purpose of the conservation tillage refundable tax offset, which is located in subdivision 385-J of the Income Tax Assessment Act 1997. This will allow primary producers access to the conservation tillage refundable tax offset where they purchase only a no-till seeding tool to attach to their existing cart. This small but important change will enable more primary producers to purchase no-till farming equipment without requiring them to replace their existing carts. This measure will help to achieve the government's objective of encouraging no-till farming practices, which can reduce emissions, increase soil carbon and improve productivity.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Schedule 2 will phase out the mature-age worker tax offset from 1 July 2012 for taxpayers who were not already 55 or older on or before 30 June 2012—that is, those born on or after 1 July 1957. The measure will not take away the mature-age worker tax offset from those people already receiving it. The government will improve value for money by phasing this offset out over time and investing in better-targeted programs, while protecting those people who already rely on the offset in their household budget.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Schedule 3 amends the excise law by putting in place a robust and sustainable compliance regime for gaseous fuels—that is, liquefied petroleum gas, or LPG; liquefied natural gas, or LNG; and compressed natural gas, or CNG—while keeping compliance costs lower than the fuel tax regime that applies to liquid fuels. The amendments ensure that suppliers of duty-free gaseous fuels, whether licensed or unlicensed, keep adequate records and provide access to ATO officials if required. There is an appropriate penalty regime to encourage compliance. The amendments also clarify the tax treatment of gaseous fuels used in forklifts and fuel manufacture.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Schedule 4 clarifies the Commissioner of Taxation's power to make legislative instruments to deal with the treatment of gaseous fuel blends instead of relying on legislative exemptions.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Schedule 5 amends the deductible gift recipient provisions of the Income Tax Assessment Act 1997. Taxpayers can claim an income tax deduction for gifts to organisations that are deductible gift recipients. The measure adds one new organisation to the act—namely, the Diamond Jubilee Trust Australia. Making this organisation a deductible gift recipient will assist it in attracting public support for its activities. The trust has been established to celebrate Her Majesty Queen Elizabeth II's diamond jubilee. The purpose of the trust is to deliver charitable projects for the support of individuals, with a focus on the poor and disadvantaged, through providing collected funds to the United Kingdom based Queen Elizabeth Diamond Jubilee Trust.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Schedule 6 amends the wine equalisation tax producer rebate provisions to ensure that a wine producer cannot claim a rebate for wine used in manufacture except where the previous producer or supplier provides a notice that a previous producer is not entitled to the rebate on part or the whole of that wine. The measure addresses a problem in the current law where multiple rebates can be claimed on the same quantity of wine. The amendments apply to assessable dealings on or after 1 December 2012 or the day on which this act receives royal assent, whichever is the later.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I note that the member for Groom has foreshadowed that he will be moving some amendments, but I also understand that, as a consequence of discussions that have been held since that time and an offer that has been made by the government to withdraw from this bill schedules 3 and 4, those that relate to gaseous fuels, this bill will proceed with the support of the opposition and that the member for Groom will not be moving the amendments that he has foreshadowed. I thank the opposition for their cooperation in this matter. </span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I do put on record, though, that the government does believe that schedules 3 and 4 of the bill both represent important improvements to Australia's excise system and that we will seek to reintroduce the schedules at another time. I foreshadow, then, that we will be looking to amend the bill to remove schedules 3 and 4 so that the remaining schedules of the bill can proceed. I seek leave to continue my remarks at a later hour.</span>

                      <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Mr TONY SMITH</span>
                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Casey</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">12:26</span>):  It was remiss of me earlier when I spoke not to congratulate you, Mr Deputy Speaker, on your long overdue election to the office of Deputy Speaker. The Tax Laws Amendment (Clean Building Managed Investment Trust) Bill 2012 will not be opposed by the opposition. Members in this House would recall that this year's budget announced an increase to the managed investment trust final withholding tax rate on payments to residents in countries with which Australia has entered into an exchange of information agreement. The withholding tax rate was doubled, from 7.5 per cent to 15 per cent. The coalition quite rightly opposed that in the Tax Laws Amendment (Managed Investment Trust Withholding Tax) Bill 2012. As the shadow treasurer articulated at the time, we opposed it because it was an increase in taxation. It had the potential to discourage investment in long-term infrastructure. It had the potential to decrease future foreign investment in Australia, increase Australia's sovereign risk profile and put Australia out of step with tax rates in the Asia-Pacific region, undermining our objective of becoming a financial services hub in the region.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I will take some of the time of the House to recount the history of this matter. It is a history that is well known to the Assistant Treasurer sitting opposite. Back in 2008, with great fanfare, the incoming Labor government, the Rudd government as it then was, announced it was reducing the relevant tax rate to 7½ per cent. It was announced in Labor's first budget and, back then, the Assistant Treasurer—not the Assistant Treasurer sitting at the table now but the Assistant Treasurer at the time, the member for Prospect and now Minister for Immigration and Citizenship—lauded this important reduction to 7½ per cent and pointed out that the reduction to 7½ per cent was designed to send a signal to the international community. It was designed to send a signal from the Labor government.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The sudden decision to double the 7½ per cent in this year's budget also sends an undeniable signal, which is that, when it comes to matters of taxation, this government cannot be trusted. When it comes to matters of certainty, the business community has every reason to hold the belief that the only guarantee from this government is that guarantees cannot be kept.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">It was not just those on this side of the House who pointed that out at the time of those debates in late June this year.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The respected financial commentator Jennifer Hewett summed it up very well in the <span style="font-style:italic;">Financial Review</span> at the time, when she made the point that the debate through the course of that last week in June showed:</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">Labor has developed an unenviable reputation for its willingness to change tax rates and structures for investments.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">This completely undercuts faith in the permanence of reforms that do occur …</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The legislation through this parliament of that tax increase took some time and had various permutations. We are back here today dealing with what is perhaps the last of those. At the time, the government decided to reward the Greens for their support for increasing the 7½ per cent rate to 15 per cent by announcing that they would come forward with a lower withholding tax rate, of 10 per cent, that would apply to payments to nonresidents by managed investment trusts that hold newly constructed, energy-efficient commercial buildings. That is what the substance of this tax law amendment bill is about.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I will run through the key elements briefly. They include a withholding tax rate, as I just said, of 10 per cent, to cover certain trust payments to a resident in a tax information exchange country. To be taxed at the final 10 per cent withholding rate, the managed investment trust's payments can comprise only income and capital gains from clean buildings and assets incidental to clean buildings. A clean building must be constructed after 30 June 2012, be a commercial building—that is, an office building, hotel or shopping centre—and hold a five-star Green Star rating as certified by the Green Building Council of Australia or a 5.5 star energy rating as accredited by the National Australian Built Environment Rating System. Even if a building meets the relevant green standards, it will be ineligible if construction began earlier than 1 July 2012. This will be the case even if significant works had not commenced by that date.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">There are some commercial obstacles presented by the bill that might prevent this concession being widely utilised. They relate to making sure that the trust satisfies the conditions to be a clean building MIT and will require careful structuring of the trust. A clean building MIT is restricted to holding taxable Australian property assets. Income from assets reasonably incidental to clean buildings—billboards and signage, telecommunication infrastructure attached to a building, and car parking facilities—will not affect the trust being a clean building MIT so long as the incidental assets are of some substance. Income from past incidental assets will not prevent the trust being an MIT, provided that income is not greater than five per cent of the trust income from clean buildings. Refurbished buildings, even where the works would lead to satisfying the standards, are ineligible. Holding other types of buildings from which it receives income will prevent the trust being a clean building MIT. The 15 per cent rate will therefore apply to payments to these nonresidents. The criteria to qualify as a clean building could lead to the precaution of quarantining these types of buildings into discrete trusts, which of course would add to costs and inefficiencies. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The concession is probably going to prove quite difficult to assess. Certainly that is the view of industry bodies and advisory firms expert in this area. The explanatory memorandum is being overly conservative in stating that the cost to revenue of the measure will be small and unquantifiable over the forward estimates. Nevertheless, as I said at the outset, the coalition is not opposing this bill. It does represent a tax cut over and above the tax hike introduced by this government some months ago, albeit to a very discrete area. As I said, it cuts the rate of withholding tax to 10 per cent from 15 per cent for these clean building managed investment trusts. Its purpose is to repay the Australian Greens for their vote to double the tax from 7.5 per cent to 15 per cent, but, as I said, on behalf of the coalition, it is a tax cut and we will not be opposing it.</span>

                      <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Mr BANDT</span>
                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Melbourne</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">12:35</span>):  I am pleased to rise on behalf of the Greens to support the Tax Laws Amendment (Clean Building Managed Investment Trust) Bill 2012. This bill is a win for the environment, it is a win for progressive business and it is an example of this parliament working properly. When the initial proposal from the government regarding withholding tax came before this parliament, the Greens had some concerns, as did a significant number of players in the business community and the progressive business community. They were concerned that the proposal might disproportionately impact on investment in clean buildings, in green buildings, in sustainable buildings. In particular, they were concerned that overseas pension funds that had higher standards of investment and that wanted to invest in places where they knew they would be getting a good return for their members and would also be helping to tackle global warming and make cities more sustainable might be disproportionately impacted. Indeed, according to the advice we had received and to what a number of people, including the Property Council of Australia said, it was these kinds of funds that were disproportionately higher players in investing in these kinds of sustainable buildings.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Equally of concern to the Greens is securing this country's revenue base. It is becoming crystal clear that there have been large numbers of promises and aspirations about what government should spend its money on, many of them incredibly worthwhile and areas that the Greens have been at the forefront of championing, from investment in schools to getting health into dental care to giving a $50-a-week increase to those who are on Newstart or youth allowance and are doing it toughest. What is becoming increasingly clear is that the money is running out. The government often boasts that they are keeping revenue as a proportion of GDP much lower than it was under former Prime Minister John Howard. To me, that is not a boast; it is a problem, because it means that we now, for example, find ourselves having in the order of $24 billion a year less revenue than we otherwise might have. That is part of the reason we see proposals like Gonski school reform being pushed out past 2020, other proposals unable to be funded in a timely manner and services increasingly at risk, such that we might not have enough money to fund the kinds of services Australians rightfully expect in an advanced, First World economy.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">So we have the question of how we begin to secure the revenue base. The principle behind the government's bill was one that we, the Greens, supported. Because this is a parliament in which the diversity of the views in the community is represented, we were able to negotiate a sensible outcome. We will be in a position where we can not only help secure the Commonwealth's revenue base but also continue to drive investment in clean buildings and in sustainable buildings. I, as someone who represents an inner-city electorate, and the Greens are acutely conscious of the fact that a substantial amount of greenhouse gas pollution comes from cities, and that includes our built environment. We need to be doing everything we can to ensure that investors do make the choice to invest in buildings that will reduce energy usage, reduce pollution and reduce the costs to the tenants who live in them.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">After discussions with the government, we are very pleased that the government agreed that a way of meeting both objectives would be to provide essentially a concessional rate for managed investment trusts in new energy-efficient buildings. I note that the coalition says that this is somehow some kind of payback, but that is not so. It is a genuine response to genuine concerns expressed by many in the business community, and I welcome the fact that the coalition will not oppose it. I commend the bill to the House.</span>

                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Flinders</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">12:40</span>):  Oh, dear! Oh, dear! This Tax Laws Amendment (Clean Building Managed Investment Trust) Bill 2012 is a shabby outcome. It is a partial concession from a government which has broken two promises. In 2008, as the member for Casey said, the government made a major point about the fact that it was sending a signal to the world that by reducing the withholding tax rate to 7½ per cent Australia was an investment destination. And now this bill comes against the background that it is doubling the withholding tax rate and, of course, it sends two messages to the world: firstly, that we are not to be trusted as a country under this ALP government and, secondly, that your investment, which was wanted in Australia, is not going to be so profitable. Therefore, desperately needed funds in the Australian building and construction sector, in particular, will be deterred from arriving in Australia.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">In short, the broader context is that the government has led us to a situation where investment in Australia's building and construction sector and Australia's office sector is now less desirable than it was and its own logic of a reduction in the withholding tax rate is sending a reversed signal. That increase, that doubling, in the withholding tax rate is not only a broken promise and therefore a sovereign risk issue; it is also a very powerful signal about investment and whether or not Australia is a desirable destination.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This bill also comes against another broken promise. It is a very clear, unequivocal broken promise. The government went to the last election—and it had it on its books for some time—with the pledge of a $1 billion clean building green tax break fund. That is gone. That went in this year's May budget. The $1 billion green buildings tax break fund is gone, evaporated, eviscerated. It has disappeared. That was an express, clear and absolute promise. The Green Building Council, ASBEC—whose chair, a former state ALP minister Tom Roper was savagely critical of the government not just for the policy breach but also for the breach of faith with a pre-election promise—and the Property Council are all groups that relied upon the government in good faith and have been disappointed.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Against that background, instead of seeing an increase in the tax rate from 7½ to 15 per cent for qualifying clean buildings, this bill only sees an effective increase from 7½ to 10 per cent. Notionally, the government is saying this is a tax deduction from 15 to 10 per cent. In theory that it right, but only because it just doubled the withholding tax from 7½ to 15 per cent a few months ago. So it doubled the tax and then reduced some of it. It is still higher than it was five months ago. In summary: (a) there is confusion; (b) there was a breach of faith; and (c) the tax rate is still going to be higher than it was five months ago. The grand selling point is that it is not going to be as high as it might have been. It is not a government that is serious about foreign investment, it is not a government that is serious about supporting clean buildings and it is not a government that is serious about its promises.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This is slightly better than would otherwise have been the case, but it is no substitute for the government's own broken promise, and I would ask the minister in his summing up to address the broken promise. We will not oppose the government's reduction in the level of effective tax paid on clean buildings but we will certainly point out that the net tax paid and payable is going up as a consequence of a series of decisions over the last few months.</span>

The Tax Laws Amendment (Clean Building Managed Investment Trust) Bill 2012 provides for a final withholding tax rate of 10 per cent on fund payments from eligible clean-building managed investment trusts made to foreign residents in countries with effective information-exchange agreements. I understand that some members would prefer the 10 per cent withholding tax rate to be more widely available than this legislation provides. I note that broadening the scope of this concession would have fiscal costs. I also note that fund payments from managed investment trusts that are not eligible for this measure can be subject to a still concessional 15 per cent final withholding tax rate. This rate is half the 30 per cent non-final withholding rate from when we came to office, and half the 30 per cent that applies to company tax.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">For these amendments to apply the managed investment trust must invest in new energy-efficient office, hotel and retail buildings that commenced construction on or after 1 July 2012. A proposed amendment to the bill, tabled today, will ensure that any works preparing the site for construction, and works undertaken below the lowest level of the proposed building, do not represent the commencement of construction for the purposes of the measure. This will make it clear that, in determining if the bill qualifies as having been commenced on or after 1 July 2012, the time of the commencement of the construction of the building is only determined by the time the works on the lowest level of the building, including any basement level, commenced.</span>

I thank you for your work and for the work of your committee in preparing your very constructive report, which was reported on yesterday and recommended that the bill be passed, with this additional clarification.</span>

                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I will address some of the comments made in the context of this debate by making the point that the 7.5 per cent rate that existed in relation to managed investment trusts prior to the budget measure that lifted the rate to 15 per cent was very low. If you compare it to the rates in comparable countries, competitor countries, then the government took the view that it was appropriate to ensure that we secure an adequate and a fair return on investments that do occur in this country. I also draw the attention of members in the House to the remarks contained throughout the Henry review that particularly make the point that location-specific rents are one area that government policy should be directed towards addressing in a way that will secure an appropriate return for the Australian people. That is what the budget measures did.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I also acknowledge the very cooperative way in which some other parties have engaged in discussions around this particular measure. We heard from the member for Melbourne, and from others in the other place, of the importance of ensuring that we continue to provide an adequate incentive for international capital to be invested in clean buildings in this country. The way in which that incentive will be built into our tax system is by providing a concessional 10 per cent rate in relation to distributions from managed investment trusts whose funds are directed towards investment in these clean building activities.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We believe that we have secured an appropriate and balanced outcome, one that makes sure that we continue to have very competitive rates in relation to our managed investment trust withholding rates. And notwithstanding that we also believe that we have struck the balance to ensure that the Australian people have secured and will secure an adequate return on investment and economic activity that occurs in this country, and it is important that we do secure the benefit of that for the Australian people. I commend the bill to the House.</span>

                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Casey</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">12:50</span>):  The coalition is supporting this amendment. As the Assistant Treasurer outlined, these flow from the relevant parliamentary committee, of which you, Madam Deputy Speaker O'Neill, are the chair and I am a member. They sought some clarifications that needed to be made, and the government has accepted those.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">In the course of speaking on these amendments, with respect to the contribution from the member for Melbourne it needs to be pointed out that his support of the government's legislation in June doubled the relevant tax rate that we have been discussing in this debate from 7.5 to 15 per cent. He claimed credit for this legislation, which reduces the 15 per cent rate to 10 per cent. As we have said, we have not opposed that. The second reading has occurred. It is a tax reduction over and above the tax doubling. But as the member for Flinders pointed out, it is a tax increase from prior to June and it is a tax increase from the government's 7.5 per cent rate, which they introduced—the rate that the Assistant Treasurer says was too low.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The constituents in the electorate of Melbourne need to know of the great triumph of the member for Melbourne in representing that electorate as a member of the Greens—an electorate that has lots of buildings in it. His net contribution has been to increase the relevant tax rate for green buildings. Before the member for Melbourne entered this place the general rate was 7.5 per cent for all buildings. Now, as a result of his dealing with this tax-increasing government, his net contribution has been to increase the rate to 10 per cent for clean buildings, and, of course, the general rate to 15 per cent. In this debate the member for Melbourne is one of those who says he likes to see a lot of sunlight in the debate, and there will certainly be sunlight on this issue.</span>

I also draw attention not to what he said but to what he did not say. I was waiting for him to announce in front of us here today that, if elected, it would be coalition policy to restore the 15 per cent withholding rate to the 7.5 per cent that previously existed under this government. That would be a very significant contribution from a person who was a part of a government that, when they left government, left the rate at 30 per cent. But it is, of course, becoming commonplace in these debates that those opposite, conscious of the importance of us running a tight budget, jump up and down, whinge and complain but when it comes to the crunch you do not hear any announcement from them that they are going to restore the position as it was. In fact, perhaps the member for Casey would like to make such an announcement.</span>

                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I am sure that the stakeholders that he referred to in his comments would very much welcome that contribution, but I would also suggest to the Australian people that, if one is listening to this debate, the absence of a commitment of that nature shows that this party, which in government delivered a 30 per cent rate, not 15 per cent and not the 10 per cent that we are debating today, is not serious about cutting rates. Of course, these rates relate to foreign investors and the contributions that they make to investment in Australia and the tax rates relate to the return that they receive. We believe 10 per cent in relation to clean buildings and 15 per cent in other respects is an appropriate balance. That is what we think strikes the balance appropriately.</span>

                      <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Ms LEY</span>
                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Farrer</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">12:57</span>):  I am delighted to speak today on the Fair Entitlements Guarantee Bill 2012. This is a bill that replaces the administrative General Employee Entitlements and Redundancy Scheme, known as GEERS, which currently assists employees who have lost their employment due to the liquidation or bankruptcy of their employer and who are owed certain employee entitlements. The GEERS program was very proudly established by the Leader of the Opposition as workplace relations minister in 2001. As I said, this bill seeks to replace the administrative General Employee Entitlements and Redundancy Scheme, GEERS, and put it into legislation. At the moment it is an administrative scheme administered by the Department of Employment, Education and Workplace Relations.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The scheme was an important one and made a great deal of difference to members or employees who lost their jobs in circumstances where their employer went into liquidation and who therefore lost their entitlements. I think all of us as local members of parliament can recall instances where sometimes large employers went belly up at short notice, not necessarily through any fault of their own, and employees were left absolutely high and dry.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">So at the time this was a very sensible and very compassionate creation of the previous, Howard government and, as I said, we all know of many circumstances where it did indeed work well.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This bill does not change the rationale for GEERS coming into action; it simply puts it in legislation. What it does change is the amount of redundancy that each worker can be entitled to under GEERS, and that is the key subject for discussion and the rationale for the coalition moving amendments to the bill that I foreshadow for the consideration-in-detail stage.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The primary objective of the bill is to set up a scheme for the provision of financial assistance, called an advance, to former employees where the end of their employment is linked to insolvency or bankruptcy of the employer. After making an advance, the Commonwealth assumes the individual's right to recover the amount that was advanced through the winding-up or bankruptcy of their employer. Many employees have to wait until the entire long, convoluted liquidation process is concluded, and often there may be other creditors ahead of them in the queue. That process is considerably shortened with GEERS. The employees are paid their redundancy by the Australian taxpayer, effectively, and then the Commonwealth embarks on the recovery of that money. Some of the key eligibility requirements of which the secretary must be satisfied in order for an advance to be paid include that the person's employment has ended, the end of the employment is actually linked to the insolvency of their employer, the employer is in liquidation or bankruptcy, and the person has unpaid employment entitlements that cannot be obtained from another source.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">So this bill enshrines in legislation a redundancy package calculated at four weeks per year of service, instead of a total of 16 weeks, which is what it is at the moment under the department's administrative scheme. Four weeks for every year of service would add up, in many cases, to a considerable amount. Now, the coalition are very cautious about this because the redundancy package under GEERS always had, in line with community expectations, a cap of 16 weeks, so we will move an amendment that reinstates that 16-week cap. While we do not object to the movement of the scheme from administration to legislation, we believe that the scheme should be kept the same in that process.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Despite our strong support for GEERS, this bill, as I said, enshrines in legislation a redundancy package calculated at four weeks per year of service, and what this may well do is set a new, high bar for union bosses as they go about enterprise bargaining. That brings me to reflect on two problems with the legislation that were identified, and they have been captured by the Australian Industry Group in their comments on this bill. They have said that it will create major risks for the federal budget and would lock in arrangements which are unfair. It is not fair, they say, for employees in large, unionised workplaces to receive much more generous compensation upon insolvency than employees working for other companies. The bill protects redundancy entitlements for up to four weeks per year of service upon insolvency, and very generous redundancy packages typically operate in large, unionised workplaces. The problem with this is that four weeks per year of service is actually relatively uncommon. It is at the top end of entitlements even for unionised workplaces. Arguably, the provisions of this bill will fuel union claims for employers to agree to similar redundancy benefits in enterprise agreements; and why would they not point to this bill as the benchmark for redundancy payouts? That redundancy payout benchmark would be considerably different from what it is now—in fact, as I said, a new, high bar which could be an ambit claim in enterprise negotiations on normal redundancies, when GEERS is obviously not about normal redundancies.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Industry has been a strong supporter of the GEER Scheme: 99.9 per cent of employers do not become insolvent and leave their employees without their entitlements and, in the relatively small number of cases where the employees would have otherwise lost entitlements, GEERS has played an extremely important role.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I understand the government has increased redundancy protection under GEERS from the 16-week cap to four weeks a year of service uncapped prior to this piece of legislation, and industry did express concern at the time that such a generous increase in benefits was very risky. This risk remains. The bill would lock in these very generous benefits into legislation and the insolvency of even one large company with a generous redundancy scheme could be a major hit on the federal budget. It is not a popular position to take. Obviously employees are very keen that they receive all of their entitlements, and we are keen too that they are not left as insolvent as their ex-employers. Obviously employers themselves, in some respects, would say that it is good that the government is picking up the tab, but government picking up the tab is the Australian taxpayer picking up the tab. Somebody has to be fiscally responsible, even if the government does not want to be, in the current climate, so it is worth reflecting, in the context of this bill, on the position that the opposition is going to take on Labor's ever-increasing debt because every day this government has been in charge of the budget that debt has been increasing.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Labor has sought to increase the limit on the government's debt ceiling on four separate occasions now. The government amended the debt ceiling in 2008 to $75 billion, this was increased again in 2009 to $200 billion during the global financial crisis, in 2011 the government increased this limit yet again to $250 billion, and in the budget this year the government increased this limit to $300 billion. That is four times the debt ceiling has been increased. I make the point that much of that is well beyond the scope of the global financial crisis and well beyond the period at which the government's stimulus packages had expired. We certainly saw evidence today from a Treasury paper about exactly how unsuccessful those stimulus packages were. Designed to make people spend money, in fact they simply did not.</span>

                    </a>  So four times the debt ceiling was raised. Why has the government raised the debt ceiling? You raise the debt ceiling because you have to be prudent enough not to actually hit the top of that ceiling, go over it and cause the inevitable results with rating agencies. Total government debt on issue is well over $250 billion—that is the government's gross debt—and with further spending for projects such as the National Broadband Network, which I know is officially off balance sheet but it still costs the Australian taxpayer, and the Clean Energy Finance Corporation, who knows where the figure will land in May next year.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The coalition is taking, as I said, a fiscally responsible approach to this legislation. We recognise the importance of GEERS because we created GEERS. We know the good work that GEERS has done in our communities when all else has failed. I have two examples when GEERS was a lifesaver in my own electorate in the past few years alone. But this exercise of the government's is a tribute to its union bosses and the future negotiating power of those union bosses when it comes to workplace conditions, including redundancy. It is capturing that in the scope of what is a bill that should look after employees in extraordinary circumstances. This is just a concession to the trade union bosses via stealth.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The high bar that this legislation will set, by the way, is done outside the Fair Work Act. And if the Fair Work Act is as strong as the government claims that it is, and subject to rigorous review as it claims it is continually doing, then why not make the adjustments within the scope of the Fair Work Act? Why bring in this separate piece of legislation?</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Ultimately a government with no proper agenda is going to have this scattergun approach—a piece of legislation to satisfy a particular interest group and perhaps in so doing wedge the coalition and say that we do not support employee redundancies or some such nonsense. People will see through that when the time comes. We do absolutely recognise the need for economic prudence.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">There is a likelihood that we will see more redundancies under this government. MYEFO predicts unemployment to increase further. Business confidence in this government is incredibly low. The carbon tax has increased the cost of doing business and those opposite have cut apprenticeship incentives for employers, further exacerbating pressure on small businesses and potentially decreasing opportunities for younger Australians to pursue a trade. What worse statement of confidence in the future of our economy could there be than saying we do not need as many apprenticeship incentives for young people entering the trades? That nasty message under the radar, under cover of MYEFO, I think should send a shockwave through the sector of the Australian economy that cares about youth unemployment. Every time the government talks about unemployment it never mentions youth unemployment, because it is a government that does not have its priorities right and has failed in this respect as in every other.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I conclude by reiterating the coalition's support for GEERS. We created GEERS but we will be moving amendments to this legislation to simply cap the entitlements that employees may receive in this particular set of circumstances at 16 weeks. The scheme from our point of view will not change. The excuse that the government is giving that somehow it needs to legislate GEERS because it is not real otherwise I think is nonsense. Who is in charge of the Department of Education, Employment and Workplace Relations if it is not the minister? Why can't the minister direct the secretary of the department, as he obviously has on every single other occasion when GEERS has been used? That is just a smokescreen. The real issue here is raising the bar for future union bosses' negotiations about workplace conditions that will put employers and the economy in an impossible position.</span>

                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Wakefield</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">13:12</span>):  I listened very carefully to the member for Farrer's contribution to the House on the Fair Entitlements Guarantee Bill 2012. This bill is a legislative example of Labor's commitment to Australian values. One of those key Australian values is a fair day's pay for a fair day's work. Implicit in that old saying is the idea that you will get paid. We know that for decades when companies became insolvent it was workers who were often the last people in line to get not just their wages but their annual leave, their leave loading, their long service leave, their payments in lieu of notice and their superannuation, which is one thing that needs to be thought about in all of this as well. You frequently find in this situation that employers are not paying their superannuation payments either. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This went on for decades and decades. As an official of the shop assistants union in South Australia I saw it myself not just in big and medium companies but even in small companies. Sometimes it was not the fault of the company and its directors, sometimes it was just economic circumstance, but there were frequent occasions when it was their fault, was due to the phoenixing of companies or was due to neglect by directors and the like. I have seen many examples in my time of where workers have been treated appallingly in redundancy situations and left in very difficult situations. I worked for a company many years ago as a trolley collector.</span>

                    </a>  Yes, I was almost too small to push it—the member for Mayo is helping me out. But I was younger and stronger in those days. The company I worked for ended up in receivership, and I remember my friend, who worked at the company at that time, telling me about the scenes out the front of the company of people who had not been paid in months. We would all have stories and examples from our electorate and from personal experience of where this has occurred, and it is terribly unfair to those concerned.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We heard the member for Farrer talk about the benign generosity of the previous government, about how they magically arrived at GEERS: one day, Tony Abbott rolled out of bed and thought, 'I might set up a scheme protecting workers' entitlements.' That is the proposition they want to put to the House, but we all remember the circumstances in which GEERS was created. We all remember what prompted it—it was the fact that one of the then prime minister's relations, as I remember, was the director of a textile company. That was what happened, wasn't it?</span>

                    </a>  I am just telling of the circumstances that led to the Australian people becoming aware of this terrible situation, and that is what happened. I cannot remember the year—I do not remember if the member for Mayo was working for the prime minister at that time. Maybe GEERS would have been a better scheme if he had been.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">It was not some sort of government program, or some sort of deliberate review by the Howard government that brought GEERS into place; it was politics. It was political pressure by the Australian people. It was the site of hundreds of workers being left without their entitlements. The Australian people demanded that something be done, and what we ended up with was GEERS.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">GEERS is a taxpayer funded scheme, and I tend to agree with the previous speaker that it is of concern that taxpayers are picking up the bill for failed companies. There are other ways you could set up entitlement guarantee schemes, and if we were starting from year zero with a blank sheet of paper we might not get the taxpayers of Australia to underwrite such schemes—we might make industry do it itself. It is truly extraordinary for industry to make these complaints when at the same time they ask the taxpayer to fund schemes like GEERS.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">But we are dealing with the structure as it is, and so we have put these entitlements into a legislative guarantee so that workers do not have to worry about people like the member for Mayo and others, one day in the distant future, being in government and ripping into entitlement schemes and the like. We know they go through periods of generosity towards workers, periods of being benign towards workers, and we know that at some point they tend to turn on workers, as Work Choices proves. I remember Work Choices; that apparently guaranteed all your entitlements as well—guaranteed that you might lose them, that is. We know it is important that we have some legislative guarantee for people's entitlements.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The previous speaker said that this is all about union bosses, and some sort of arrangement with them. It is actually about our relationship with workers. That is why we want to guarantee wages up to 13 weeks. That is why we want to make sure that workers get their redundancy entitlement capped at a maximum of four weeks of service per year. This is not some sort of rolled gold union guarantee—that is not uncommon, and certainly not at the top end of town. We know what kind of payouts they take when they leave companies.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">

                      <span class="HPS-MemberContinuation">Mr CHAMPION:</span>
                    </a>  Not at Holden, but I can remember at David Jones years ago, when they were closing John Martin, a certain chief executive sailing off with a huge entitlement package while workers in South Australia, particularly long-term casuals, had to fight in court to get their redundancy payments. I remember that. It is quite common for the top end of town to have a different set of rules for separation packages, particularly in relation to stock options, than they have for the people at the bottom who actually do the work and create the value and the wealth.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The bill also guarantees payment in lieu of notice, capped at five weeks, and that is not an unreasonable thing to do. Workers do deserve notice. I have been in many situations and seen many situations, particularly in the textile industry, where companies would be saying to workers, right up until literally the day before they announced closures, that they would not be closing and that it was business as usual and all the rest of it. Often one of the things that hurt and frustrate workers most of all is the persistent lying that goes on up until closures are announced. Often workers know that the writing is on the wall; they hear the rumours. But what we often see is—and I will not call it lying—corporate obfuscation about what they are doing.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">So, having a payment in lieu of notice is an important thing. Getting notice is an even nicer thing—and, of course, guaranteeing annual leave and long service leave. It should be stressed that often people in these companies—companies that are under economic stress—will not let you take your long service leave or will delay letting you take it and will delay letting you take your annual leave. So people bank a lot of leave. That is a common thing that happens.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">These sorts of things are very important for workers—things like a safety net, a guarantee. We know that for decades they basically endured without these, and people lost vast amounts of money over the years, unable to obtain their funds. Or they sat in a line of creditors, behind banks and behind others, waiting for their entitlements—and we know that was a persistent worry.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">There have been some unions, I have to say, who were particularly active in making sure this issue was front and centre, and the Australian Manufacturing Workers Union was one of them. I can remember them talking about this, particularly in the car components industry—people like John Camillo and John Gee, out there on the barricades making sure workers' entitlements were paid and making sure they had a guarantee of those entitlements. And I remember people like Bob Donnelly from the CEPU and others being out there on the shop floor making sure workers got their entitlements. But what we are doing here in this House is legislating to make sure union leaders do not have to fight battle after battle and fight after fight to make sure people just get their entitlements. We want to make sure that people have some reasonable certainty about their situation with regard to their entitlements in times of insolvency.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This is a very good bill. It proves that despite all the rhetoric of those opposite the Labor movement still exists for working people across this country. It puts into place important guarantees, and it should give everybody who believes in that old Australian saying about a fair day's pay for a fair day's work some reassurance that that still means something in this modern age.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">But I digress. Regarding the bill the member for Wakefield has spoken on—the Fair Entitlements Guarantee Bill 2012—I support the member for Farrer in saying that we will be moving a second reading amendment, which I will refer to later. There were many points on which I agree with the member for Wakefield, particularly relating to the actions some companies take towards the end, when they are clearly heading in the direction of not being able to survive. I think that has been shameful at times in our history.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I refer to a good example in late 2006 where a certain components company based in Sydney, with some South Australian ownership, treated their workers in a terrible way—which I think even today, interestingly, would still be a difficult issue for any government to deal with if an employer took such an attitude towards a certain company. I remember that a certain Sydney talkback host jumped on that issue and made great hay with it. But, truth be told, when an employer wants to act in that manner, it can treat people terribly. I think that is a very good point that the member makes. Equally, there are times when employers and directors make bad decisions or deliberately make decisions which seek to unfairly treat their workers. That is why we need protections in law in this country: to ensure that people are not unfairly treated. We do need a safety net, and we have always supported—I have always supported—the need for a strong safety net of entitlements for people in the workplace.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">But what the member for Wakefield did not refer to, of course, is that there are times when organised labour and workers' representatives also make mistakes and also push too far in making companies pay for entitlements which are clearly beyond the capacity of certain companies to pay for into the future. They are unsustainable, and that equally leads to the unfortunate circumstances where companies cannot continue to operate and therefore go out of business. You have to wonder sometimes whether cutting your own throat is a good idea, and that certainly has been the case with many companies.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Equally, right now, today, as we speak, there are companies—including one big company that operates in the northern suburbs of Adelaide, in the member for Wakefield's electorate—who have agreed to arrangements which are very generous. When those companies are the beneficiaries of significant taxpayer support in the first place, you have to wonder whether these companies and these workers—</span>

                    </a>  Of course the union tells its workers that this is a terrific idea, but at the end of the day, if it makes it harder for these companies to survive in a difficult time—when the dollar is undoubtedly putting pressure on manufacturing and when heavy manufacturing in Australia is suffering—and if heavy manufacturing plants agree to over-the-top, over-the-tote wages and send around letters claiming that the wages and conditions are not over the top and not over the tote odds, you do have to wonder if they are operating in their best interests. Of course, what that will lead to from time to time is companies going out of business.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">What happened when the Howard government was in power—it was in 1999, I believe, when the first iteration of the GEERS scheme was put in place—was that the state Labor governments in particular and, in truth, federal Labor had failed to put in place protections for redundancy payments and certain entitlements over their years in power. This was reasonably non-controversial at the time of introduction, in the sense that there were some companies that went out of business leaving employees without their entitlements, and the Howard government moved to address that. But it became much more stressful and difficult and much more relevant on 12 September 2001, when Ansett went out of business. This is another example where, through both management decisions and overly generous employment conditions, the company could not survive. With changes occurring in the aviation industry, what happened was that the build-up of that pressure put that company under such stress that thousands of Australians lost their jobs, and many still campaign today for what they believe are their rightful entitlements, which they have not received from administrators and the like. The Howard government moved very quickly. Of course, at that time there were other international events which had people concerned about what was going on, and the Howard government reassured people, moved quickly and created the GEERS scheme, which they then built on immediately post the Ansett crisis and which assisted those workers at a time of great need.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The establishment of that scheme basically ensured that workers, in the circumstances in which they met the criteria, could be guaranteed redundancy payments that met relevant community standards. What that sought to do is, where organised labour, company directors, CEOs or owners of businesses made bad or inappropriate decisions and overly inflated certain entitlements, particularly in relation to redundancy, the taxpayer, while ensuring a safety net, was not going to be put on the hook for amounts that are far above community expectations. The member for Wakefield referred to certain high end employers whose shareholders agree to their packages of employment. They do not get picked up by the taxpayer in the event that the companies go broke, and nor should they be. I also note that he did not refer to certain other companies when he referred to high end employers.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">What the member for Wakefield failed to mention is that what the government is doing here is trying to increase by stealth, in effect, the acceptable community standard for redundancy payments. From my years in industrial relations—about 15—four weeks per year has never been the community standard. It has always been capped. In fact, 16 weeks is at the high end or the generous level of the cap. By putting forward a bill in which you are changing the arrangements of the GEERS program in the first place and in which you are extending by stealth what the acceptable community standard the government is trying to establish a new benchmark and put pressure on Australian businesses to meet that.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The argument that will flow from unions in negotiations will be, 'If it's good enough for the government and if the government can guarantee this amount, so should you, Mr Employer.' This will flow down the employment food chain from big businesses, which will have to meet these new standards—and I am sure that in some circumstances they already have arrangements that are not dissimilar—all the way down to the smallest businesses, which cannot carry these new entitlements.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">In the next 12 months, we will unfortunately see people lose their jobs. There is structural change going on in the company. We hear that constantly from the government and that point is right. We will also see very quickly a lot of smaller businesses signing up to agreements so that they do not have disputation in their workplace. There is now Fair Work legislation that makes it impossible for them to stand up to union bullying. They will agree to these arrangements. They will have to make changes to their businesses and they will be stuck with redundancy payments that they cannot possibly pay. What you will have is this perverse effect where more companies will be forced out the back door, to use a famous saying of a former Prime Minister in this place. That will be the outcome of this move by the government to uncap this entitlement. It will be unaffordable for many businesses. Pressure will be put on them through industrial negotiations to sign up.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We know, because business leader after business leader have told us, that these industrial negotiations are now skewed very much to organised labour rather than to the interests of employees, of businesses and of our economy. That is why we object and that is why we are moving, as the member for Farrar outlined, a reasonable amendment to improve this bill. That amendment will cap that amount at 16 weeks of pay. We believe that that is the acceptable community standard. People in the community would agree with that. But equally the taxpayer has to pick up these tabs. As the member for Wakefield said and as I remarked at the beginning of this contribution, there are many circumstances in which businesses go insolvent.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Some of them, many of them, are when company directors and businesses have made the wrong decisions about their business, undoubtedly. Equally I agree with the member for Wakefield that sometimes businesses handle those circumstances horrifically and do not treat their workers properly and that there should be some protection in the system for people, their families and their livelihoods. I think that is a perfectly reasonable position. That was the position that the Howard government adopted in 2001, and then built upon in the years following.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">But what this bill does is unfairly put the taxpayer on the hook for entitlements which are far beyond community expectation. That is where we object and that is why we are moving to assist the government in improving this piece of legislation. While the Howard government were the authors, the designers and the people behind this move, and while the coalition support very much the strengthening of these provisions with the conditions that we have talked about, ensuring that there are conditions on how this money is accessed and that the normal insolvency provisions are followed, people should not expect that the government will pick up unreasonable entitlements.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Mr Deputy Speaker Symon, you know industrial relations well. You have been involved in industrial relations for many years and you know how this works. When there is a new entitlement in the system it flows through, like water flows down a drainpipe, because that is exactly how unions seek to get higher conditions in employment agreements. They start at the top, with the bigger guys who can usually afford it—not always, but most usually—and usually with the public sector. They move on to bigger employers and then it trickles down, right through to smaller businesses that often cannot pay the same generous entitlements that bigger companies do. If they do not meet those challenges, if they do not meet those set standards—and, of course, this is one of the great faults of the old tripartite system—they end up being put on the hook for conditions they cannot meet, even though employees have an expectation that they will meet them because the employer has signed an agreement with them under the pressure of organised labour.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We support the direction of this bill, and we have said that very clearly. But we do not support the uncapping of this entitlement. We say put a reasonable limit on it—a number of weeks' pay to a maximum of 16 weeks. I cannot see how anyone, particularly with experience in this field, could object to that—anyone who wants to protect the taxpayer from unreasonable amounts signed up by companies, sometimes under pressure, sometimes with agreements that are far outside community expectations and sometimes where people have acted inappropriately. Whatever the circumstances of the business going down, the taxpayer should not be required to pick up that fault at this level.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Unfortunately, the bill is badly thought through, and that is why we are trying to assist the government to fix it. We hope that the government will adopt this amendment, which is reasonable, to ensure that a good idea put in place by the Howard government is strengthened even further so that Australian families can have surety that their entitlements, in the event that their company goes broke, will still be there.</span>

                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">

                    <a href="30540" type="MemberSpeech">
                      <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Ms BRODTMANN</span>
                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Canberra</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">13:38</span>):  I am very pleased to hear from the member for Mayo that there should be protections for employees because that is what the Fair Entitlements Guarantee Bill 2012 is all about. He harked back to the glory days of the Howard government, and I was reminded of what the Howard government did to Canberra and to the Public Service. It contrasts very dramatically with what the Gillard government is doing for the Public Service and its support for the Australian Public Service and for Australian workers. As the member for Canberra, which is an electorate with thousands and thousands of public servants, I have been a strident supporter of the Public Service for years, having been a former public servant for 10 years before I set up my own microbusiness, and I am a strident and strong supporter of the public sector in general.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The Gillard government has ensured that we have a stable public service and that we continue to build a stable public service.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We are always working towards making sure the Public Service is resourced to tackle current and future challenges and at the same time we are always looking to remove inefficiencies where they exist. We have been doing that since 2007, tackling a range of areas where we can drive greater efficiency in the Public Service, and we have recently done that with the recent announcements on travel and publications a range of other measures. So we are constantly looking for improvements in the Public Service and greater efficiencies at the same time as trying to ensure that we have a stable Public Service.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">My passionate and strong advocacy for Canberra and for the Public Service is well known and well documented in this House, as is my support for small- and micro-business sector that work with and support the Public Service. I would like to use this opportunity to draw to the House's attention the fact that this evening my colleague the Minister for Small Business and I, as well as the shadow minister, will be launching the Parliamentary Friends for Small Business. It is the first time an organisation like this has been established. We are very much looking forward to the launch of that initiative. It was an initiative that I discussed with the former Minister for Small Business early on in my term and I am really pleased that we are finally getting it off the ground tonight. A am looking forward to all parties continuing to engage with small and micro businesses on their concerns to ensure that they are heard in the policy arena.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The reasons that members like me need to defend the Public Service and workers and to stand up legislation like this bill is because they are constantly under threat and attack by those opposite. The member for Mayo reminded us of what the Howard government did in terms of workers entitlements. It reminded me again of what he did in Canberra and also throughout Australia to the Australian Public Service. Those opposite are constantly criticising the Public Service. They are constantly criticising the value and the worth of the people who work in it. As a Canberran I have lived through the boom-and-bust mentality of those opposite and I know how damaging their policies can be.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I was one of the 30,000 Australians who lost their Public Service job when the Howard government was in power and they took the cleaver to the public sector. I was at that time posted to India and after only being there for four months I was told that my position had been abolished. I was asked to stay on for the year so that I could take part in a major integrated country promotion of all Australia's achievements in the nation. But then I was brought back here and basically had to reapply for my job. There were 50 of us in my cohort of workers in the public diplomacy sector before I left the shores of Australia for India. When I reapplied for my job in Australia there were only eight left. At the same time my now husband had resigned his job from the <span style="font-style:italic;">Canberra Time. </span>We came back and did a bit of part-time work. The knock-on effects of Public Service job losses is not just by the individual but also by the spouses who may not be able to get employment themselves and also by their families and also the broader community.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I remember when I was in DFAT I came back to farewells being held in bulk. That is the legacy of the Howard government in terms of the Public Service. In that time, as I mentioned, 30,000 jobs nationally were lost. Over five years there was a decline in the Commonwealth Public Service here in the ACT of nearly 16,000 permanent jobs—15,800 to be exact. As I mentioned, it is not just the Public Service that feels the impact of that; here in Canberra every small business paid the price of the axe that was taken to the Public Service jobs. Many local shops were empty or only half full and house prices plummeted. The growth industry was removalists. People left town—our population dropped dramatically. It took us many years to rebuild in terms of an economy and in terms of growth.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">It was the workers who lost out, workers who lost their entitlements as well as their income. As I said, it was not just public servants who experienced this; it was also businesses. Both business and non-business bankruptcies at that time jumped sharply as a result of the cleaver that was taken to the public sector.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I would just like to remind the House that the budget surplus that the Gillard government are committed to is designed to protect us against any further global economic turmoil and, however difficult this task will be, I know that the Gillard government will always seek to protect jobs and grow jobs, as we have—800,000 jobs, in fact—which is in stark contrast to those opposite, who proudly boast about Canberra-bashing and demonising the Public Service. The introduction of this bill will benefit a range of sectors—and it is not just in Canberra that this will be felt; it will be felt right throughout the nation—and it will have a significant impact on employee benefits.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I want to run through the details of the bill in terms of what it is actually designed to achieve. It will establish a basis for advancing unpaid employee entitlements so that eligible employees who lose their jobs and are owed entitlements are actually paid those entitlements when their employer is insolvent. Replacing the General Employee Entitlements and Redundancy Scheme, it will allow the Commonwealth to provide financial assistance in the form of an advance to cover certain unpaid employee entitlements when the end of the person's employment is linked to the insolvency of their employer. After an advance is made, the Commonwealth will assume the individual's right to recover the amounts advanced through the winding-up or bankruptcy of the employer.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Eligible employees will be covered for the following unpaid employment entitlements: wages of up to 13 weeks; redundancy pay, which will be capped at a maximum of four weeks pay per year of service; payment in lieu of notice, which will be capped at five weeks; annual leave; and long service leave. The key changes that this bill establishes include removing eligibility requirements associated with deed-of-company arrangements and mirroring bankruptcy arrangements; extending eligibility for entitlements that crystallise after the appointment of an insolvency practitioner, which is essentially to cover that portion of the entitlement that the insolvency practitioner is not obliged to pay; simplifying transfer-of-business rules, with effect from 1 July 2014; and removing the discretion to accept claims that are not made within 12 months of the end of a person's employment or the appointment of an insolvency practitioner. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The bill also includes arrangements for ministerial and/or departmental discretion to be used in a number of specific non-routine circumstances where the act of discretion supports the objects of the bill. These amendments are designed to address minor technical faults.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Clauses 12 and 25 of the bill refer to exclusions for changes in terms and conditions in the six months before the insolvency event; and, following the introduction of the bill, the department has re-examined these provisions and advised that the current drafting is not sufficiently wide enough to capture redundancy and payment in lieu of notice, as these are contingent liabilities that arise only on termination of employment. So the department has recommended that these provisions be amended to correctly reflect the intent that redundancy and payment in lieu of notice are captured.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I have highlighted some of the Gillard government's commitments to the Public Service and also to jobs but I also want to remind the House of the commitments to employee fairness that have been the tradition of Labor since its inception, since the beginning of the party. That is the reason we were established: to protect workers rights and conditions. I was reminded, when looking at this bill today, of work that I did in the Attorney-General's Department in the early part of my career, where the Labor government established the Insolvency and Trustee Service. It was the first service established to actually address bankruptcies and ensure that there was some legislation, and an agency, introduced to ensure that workers rights and entitlements were protected. Prior to that, we had seen what happened in the late eighties. There were a number of businesses that went bankrupt where the company director essentially left the country, in many cases with huge swags of money, leaving employees with nothing.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">They were left with no pay, no entitlements, no conditions—nothing. So the initiatives and the legislation that we introduced, and it was the first such legislation for the nation at that time thanks to Labor, were designed to ensure that there were some protections for workers. As we know, these things change over time and we become more aware of gaps in legislation and it is good to see that we are constantly updating legislation to ensure that we are constantly looking out for workers and looking after workers to protect their rights and entitlements.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I commend this bill to the House. I believe it exemplifies all the best that is Labor and all that is good about Labor. The reason I joined the Labor Party is that it is all about workers' fair rights, workers' entitlements and ensuring that they are protected when the company or organisation that they work for goes belly up, becomes insolvent. It is unfair for workers to be exposed. Quite often it is not about an inadequate board of directors. Quite often it is about the circumstances and a business can no longer be solvent. But workers should not have to pay for bad economic circumstances or bad decisions by the board of directors. They should receive their fair share of entitlements and conditions, and that is what this bill addresses.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I want to come back to the Public Service and remind Canberrans of 1996, when the Howard government was in power, and remind them of the fact that at that stage there were 30,000 Public Service jobs lost in Australia, nearly 16,000 of them here in Canberra. House prices plummeted, local shops closed down and removalists found theirs was a growing industry as people left town. It took us a long time to recover from that.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I draw the House's attention and also Canberrans' attention to the comments made by those opposite about their desire to get rid of 20,000 public servants. I ask them to consider what that will mean for the Canberra and also the Australia of the next decade. Do we want to go back to 1996 when we did experience that slump in the local economy? It was not just about the local economy here in Canberra as it did have a significant knock-on effect throughout the region of Eden-Monaro and throughout the capital region of Canberra. If you went down to the South Coast you saw three out of four houses up for sale. Again, it had a knock-on effect all around here in terms of the farms and properties around this region and it had a knock-on effect for Queanbeyan. So it just does not affect the public sector here in Canberra; it affects hundreds of thousands of jobs throughout the region. I remind Canberrans to remember 1996 and reflect on the potential for 20,000 job losses.</span>

                      <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Mr SIMPKINS</span>
                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Cowan</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">13:53</span>):  I appreciate the opportunity, in this short period over the next seven minutes before question time begins, to speak on the Fair Entitlements Guarantee Bill 2012. Clearly, this debate is fairly wide-ranging given some of the comments that have been made. I have just heard the member for Canberra talk about what happened in 1996. I think I should remind Canberrans of what happens when a house is left in disorder, when a government has led the country to live beyond its means and racked up $96 billion in debt. Someone needs to then come in and clean up the mess and I think it is not right for the team that left the mess to then blame the next team that comes in for the cleaning up of the mess. Whilst members from Queensland might be complaining about the things that take place in Queensland under the new government, the trouble is that when the last Queensland government left the place stayed in a mess with huge amounts of debt and someone needed to make the hard decisions.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The hard decisions had not been made for a long time. Largesse in government spending had taken place over many years in Queensland and someone needed to come in and do something about it. The reality is that the country now faces $257 billion of debt, thanks to those opposite. They have taken us from a net asset position of some $70 billion and now we are $257 billion in the red. Someone needs to clean up the mess.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We welcome the opportunity to speak about the Fair Entitlements Guarantee Bill 2012. This is an evolution from the previous legislation that applied, the General Employee Entitlements and Redundancy Scheme. The current Leader of the Opposition, the Hon. Tony Abbott, who was the workplace relations minister in 2001, established that scheme. It was to protect the employee entitlements of more than 90 per cent of workers who lose their entitlements when their company becomes insolvent. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Obviously there are circumstances in this country where certain companies might run into difficulties. A lot of companies in this country now face difficulties. There are a lot of businesses out there whose confidence has been sapped by this current government and now they are facing all sorts of problems. Every day in question time we raise the plight of these companies, and the government dismisses us and dismisses the interests of these businesses. It is not right. Thanks to the lack of confidence that this government has created across so many states, even in Western Australia now, we need to look at this Fair Entitlements Guarantee Bill. That is the problem that this country faces. Hopefully, after the next election there will be a greater degree of confidence and this country will start being able to move forward again.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The coalition will move an amendment to this bill to include a cap on the redundancy payment at 13 weeks. That is the right and appropriate thing to do, given that that is in line with Labor's very own Fair Work Act. The coalition was always very careful with the GEERS, the General Employee Entitlements and Redundancy Scheme, to ensure that the scheme kept in line with the community standard. The amendment that we propose would ensure that the standard—the high bar—of Labor's own Fair Work Act is maintained. We acknowledge the importance of looking after workers and making sure that, in circumstances in which businesses go under, something is done about entitlements and people are looked after. The eligibility requirements for these entitlements are that the person's employment has ended, the end of the employment is linked to the insolvency of the employer, the employer is in liquidation or bankruptcy, and the person has unpaid employment entitlements that cannot be obtained from another source.</span>
                </p>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We acknowledge that this needs to take place. This was the side that actually initiated this action when it needed to be done. The person that initiated it was the Leader of the Opposition, looking after people that needed to be looked after when the pressure was on, back in 2001. In this place, we are used to hearing how we are responsible for all the dramas in this country—that, when there is someone to blame, it is always us. But, back in 1996, when one side left this country in disorder, someone needed to clean up the mess. Now we face exactly the same circumstances, where one side is leaving this country in disorder—$257 billion of gross debt—and someone needs to come in and fix it up. I hope that, when the time comes, not only the rest of the country but Canberrans as well will remember that, when someone takes responsibility, this country can be brought back into order. </span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I appreciate the opportunity today to make comments on this bill. I completely endorse the amendment that will be brought forward to include a cap on the redundancy payment at 13 weeks. That will be in line with the government's own Fair Work legislation that they always stand by so completely. In any case, I look forward to the government considering what needs to be done and making sure that our amendment is fully accepted, because that is the best way to progress this matter.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Small">That the House express its deep regret at the death on 28 October 2012 of the Honourable Gordon Neil Bilney, a former Minister and Member of this House for the Division of Kingston from 1983 to 1996, place on record its appreciation of his long and meritorious public service, and tender its profound sympathy to his family in their bereavement.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Today we farewell a good friend and honoured colleague, Gordon Bilney, who died in Adelaide on Sunday aged 73. His was a life of opportunity, built in the optimistic days of postwar Australia, and he turned his share of that opportunity to the common good through a life dedicated to public service. Gordon Bilney grew up in Adelaide and originally trained as a dentist. But he soon traded the drill for new horizons as a diplomat, joining the Department of Foreign Affairs in 1966. He held postings all around the world and served as an adviser to Gough Whitlam and Senator Don Willesee in their capacity as Foreign Affairs Minister. He returned to the diplomatic service in 1975, reaching ambassadorial rank five years later.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">In 1983 Gordon Bilney entered parliament as the member for Kingston, one of the 28 members of the class of 1983 who so greatly defined the Hawke era. Gordon lived the perilous life of a marginal seat MP and was re-elected four times, including the remarkable contest against Janine Haines in 1990 and the sweetest victory of all in 1993. In 1990 he was elected as a minister, serving for two terms in the portfolios of Defence Science and Personnel and Development Co-Operation and Pacific Island Affairs. Gordon believed in our foreign aid program and its power to do good. He recognised the need for engagement with the Pacific and he understood Australia's potential as a creative middle power in a changing world.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">But today Gordon Bilney's friends will dwell as much on his personality as on his long record in public life. Alan Ramsey once described Gordon Bilney as 'a free and roly-poly spirit with considerable style and acerbic wit'. He loved language and words and had a waspish sense of humour. He enjoyed a lifelong love of football, AFL, that started in the 1940s after his dad returned from the war, and he had a great gift for friendship. If the people you choose as friends are a test of your character then Gordon Bilney passed with flying colours, because he counted remarkable individuals like John Button and Alan Ramsey amongst his friends.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Gordon Bilney's knife-edge political career was brought to an end by the voters of Kingston on 2 March 1996. Not long after, the journalist Deborah Hope did a sympathetic piece on former MPs for the <span style="font-style:italic;">Australian</span>. She began with this description of Gordon Bilney:</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Small">Gordon Bilney is standing by the window of his Adelaide home, a gorgeous glass of red in his hand, taking in the ocean view and thinking about cooking the fish he had caught the day before.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">That is Gordon Bilney as so many will remember him—witty, cultured, a good book close at hand, and very much at home in the city that he loved. Although his work took him all around the world, it was to Adelaide that Gordon Bilney returned. It was that great city that he represented in this House and it was in that great city that he breathed his last on Sunday. On behalf of the government and the people of Australia, and also on behalf of our Labor family, I extend the nation's condolences to Gordon Bilney's widow, Sandra; his three children, Carolyn, Sarah and Nicky; his five grandchildren and all who loved this brilliant man who placed his gifts at the service of Australia and has earned the best accolade any of us could hope for. He left the nation a better place and we are saddened by his passing.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">
                  <a href="EZ5" type="MemberSpeech">
                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Mr ABBOTT</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Warringah</span>—<span class="HPS-MinisterialTitles">Leader of the Opposition</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">14:05</span>):  I rise to join the Prime Minister in celebrating the life of Gordon Bilney, the former member for Kingston. Of particular note is his service to our country as the first ever dedicated Minister for Development Co-operation and Pacific Island Affairs. This was a good precedent, established by the Keating government, and one that might perhaps be followed in a future parliament. Gordon was, as the Prime Minister has remarked, a man with a great sense of humour and a bon vivant of some note. I understand that there are collections of his Parliament House port, bottled to celebrate the move from Old Parliament House to this place, complete with a description by Mungo MacCallum, that still grace the cellars of at least some of the present occupants of this building. If anyone has any I would be glad to share it with them!</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">As the Prime Minister has also mentioned, in 1993 Gordon was challenged in his seat by the then Senator Janine Haines, the popular leader of the Australian Democrats, who was trying to break into the lower house of the parliament. I understand that he was so desperate for the Democrats to come third in that contest, and so worried about the Liberal vote, that he actually voted Liberal in the 1993 election—or, at least, so he told a journalist some years ago. Well, any Labor minister who votes Liberal is obviously a pretty good character, and we would like to see more of that in the years ahead! Gordon Bilney made a fine contribution to our country. He followed his star, he was true to his principles and he was an adornment to the parliament. On behalf of the coalition I offer our condolences to his partner, Sandra, and to his daughters.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">
                  <a href="HWA" type="MemberSpeech">
                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Ms RISHWORTH</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Kingston</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">14:07</span>):  I rise to add my words of condolence to those of the Prime Minister and the Leader of the Opposition, to pay tribute to Gordon Bilney's service both as a former Labor federal member for Kingston and also as a minister in both the Hawke and Keating federal Labor governments. I have had the honour of knowing Gordon for some years now, and it was with great sadness that I learned of his recent passing. While Gordon had been unwell for some time, his partner, Sandy, tells me that his passing came as quite a shock, and my thoughts are with his family at this very sad time. Gordon will be truly missed by his family and friends in the local southern suburbs of Adelaide and in the wider community.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Gordon served in this parliament as the member for Kingston from 1983 until 1996. The local community in southern Adelaide will remember his commitment to fight against injustice wherever he saw it. He often put it that he would stand up for the underdog. In his maiden speech, Gordon spoke about the things that mattered most to ordinary Australians. He spoke about the importance of ensuring access to quality health care for everyone in this country. He spoke about ensuring that housing security was available for those most vulnerable. And he spoke about the struggles of women and the importance of affordable and accessible child care. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">People may not be aware that Gordon actually trained as a dentist. According to his partner, Sandy, it was this experience that ultimately led him to pursue a career in politics. He could not stand by and watch while so many Australians suffered from poor oral health because they could not afford a visit to a dentist. He felt compelled to do something to change this injustice. Gordon was never known to back down from a fight. There is no better example than his fight against the development of the open space of Glenthorne Farm, in the southern suburbs of Adelaide. Gordon led this lengthy fight by the local community over some years to prevent this land being developed for housing, and it was one that was ultimately successful. Today the land still remains undeveloped. I know that Gordon was very passionate about the history and character of the southern suburbs of Adelaide, and he stood against a number of development proposals that threatened the character of our beautiful suburbs.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Equally, Gordon never backed down from a fight during an election campaign. There was no better demonstration of this than during the 1990 election, where he faced a formidable opponent in the high-profile candidate and leader of the Australian Democrats, Janine Haines. The Australian Democrats mounted an unprecedented campaign in an attempt to win the seat of Kingston. Never one to be easily rattled, Gordon held his ground against his opponent and ultimately was victorious.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">During the Hawke and Keating governments he served as Minister for Defence Science and Personnel and also as Minister for Development Co-operation and Pacific Island Affairs. Before his life in politics, Gordon also had a distinguished career as a foreign diplomat. In his ministerial roles, Gordon's achievements included fostering our deeper constructive engagement with the Pacific region, particularly focused on improving the status of women in areas of social and economic life where inequalities persisted. Through Australian aid programs he was committed to enhancing opportunities for women in the region, particularly in the area of family planning. It was under the watch of Gordon Bilney, in his role as Minister for Defence Science and Personnel, that the recruitment policies of the Australian Defence Force were reviewed and the ban was lifted so that gay soldiers could openly serve in the defence of our nation. These achievements, again, demonstrated his commitment to eliminating injustice where he saw it.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Gordon was a man of tremendous wit and kindness. He was a man who detested pretension and was approachable and well loved in the community. At times he could be a little mischievous. In Sandy's words, he loved to stir the pot. Gordon never suffered those he believed to be fools. One of the stories that has been often recounted in recent days is that he did continue to respond to correspondence after he lost in 1996, but signing off with a new flavour. I quote one of his letters:</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Small">One of the greatest privileges of private life is that I no longer need to be polite to nincompoops, bigots, curmudgeons or twerps ...</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Gordon clearly demonstrated that he had a way with words, and in his student days at Adelaide University Gordon was an active member of the Playwright for the Footlights club dramatic society. In life after politics he continued to pursue his avid interest in the use of words, including being a regular contributor to the <span style="font-style:italic;">Sydney Morning Herald</span>'s word watch column.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Gordon will be remembered as a remarkable man of high intellect and wit, but also as an ordinary man who told it like it was and rejected self-importance. After life in politics, Gordon spent a great time enjoying activities such as fishing and reading, and at times could be seen in these corridors spruiking a McLaren Vale shiraz or offering a piece of advice. I am personally grateful for Gordon's advice, support and kind words that he provided to me over the years. My thoughts and sympathies are with Gordon's family at this sad time: his partner, Sandy; his daughters, Caroline and Sarah; his son, Nicholas; and his four granddaughters and one grandson, who I know he was very proud of. Gordon will be remembered for many years to come for the significant contribution he made to his local community, to the country and to our region. </span>

Whilst we have a good schooling system, in the standards of the world we have been slipping behind, and this is not a race that we can afford to lose. So we are determined to drive the quality of schooling around the country for every child in every school. We have therefore moved beyond the old politics of division in education based on school sector and moved to working on the education of every child in every school. Our National Plan for School Improvement, which will be associated with the funding reforms that we are working on with the states and territories' independent and Catholic school systems, will have this drive to be amongst the world's best embedded in it.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Second, we also want all students to have the opportunity to undertake a continuous course of study in an Asian language throughout their school years. We have identified as priorities Chinese, Hindi, Indonesian and Japanese, and we will embed this in our school reform agenda and new funding arrangements. Third, we will ensure that we integrate Asia across all of the subjects of the curriculum through our world-leading new national curriculum.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We know that this Asian century is real, it is changing and it is complex. I want our nation to be a winner in this century. What that means is that I want every child to win a great education, and we are determined to ensure that that happens.</span>

                  </a>  Speaker, I was asked a question by the member for Reid about the opportunities for the future in the Asian century—something that everyone on this side of House is intensely focused on, because we understand that to create prosperity for the future, to spread opportunity in our country, we have to be fairly and squarely focused on the region, and how we can maximise the opportunities for growth in the region. And that is what the government has done through the Asian century whitepaper. It is a positive plan for the future.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Contrast that to the mud bucket being thrown by those opposite. We have had two questions today: all the mud slingers are out there. They have no plans for the future. We on this side of the House are going to focus on positive plans for the future. We understand that the opportunities in the region that will flow our way can create enormous wealth for Australia if we maximise those opportunities from the growth in the region.</span>

What that was all about is understanding what we must do. As the Prime Minister said before, we have got to invest in education and skills. That is the key to lifting our productivity in the Asian century. We have got to invest in infrastructure. That is the key to lifting our productivity in the Asian century. We have got to reform, fundamentally, a whole host of areas of public policy, from regulation to tax. This is the positive approach of everybody on this side of the House, and it stands in stark contrast to how negative everyone on that side of the House is. </span>

And they have turned off him because of how negative he is. He does not have a positive thing to say about this country. He talks the economy down every day. On this side of the House we will talk about the positives in Australia, because we believe in Australia.</span>

That is the same MYEFO that delivers billions of dollars in savings to return the budget to surplus, and we are on track to deliver that. The shadow minister evidences some concern about boat arrivals. Like him I am concerned about boat arrivals. I am concerned about the months and months and months of reckless delay that the negativity of the opposition costs us, and I am concerned now that they still fail to endorse the full recommendations of the Houston review.</span>

Is it true that the Minister for Resources and Energy has effectively made it compulsory for Woodside's proposed giant gas hub to proceed only if it is built specifically at James Price Point? Why has the minister done this despite independent analysis showing that building at this particular location will cost billions more than the alternatives, will come with severe environmental consequences and is opposed by the Broome community? Will the Prime Minister review this arrangement and ensure a win-win enabling the world's greatest whale nursery to be protected, dinosaur footprints to be preserved and billions saved for Woodside?</span>

I understand this is an issue that he is concerned about. I would say to the member that the basis of his question is not correct. The minister has not made it compulsory for Woodside to proceed with this proposal. What the minister for resources has done is set a time frame for the joint-venture partners to make a final investment decision in the first half of 2013 on the proposed gas processing hub at James Price Point. A strategic assessment of the environmental impacts of the project has been submitted to the WA government and is currently under consideration. After that process has ended—that is, the state process has ended—it will then be a matter for consideration by the federal government, by the Commonwealth. Finalisation of the Western Australian government's report must come first. It must precede final termination of the assessment documents. This process requires all potential environmental, heritage and Indigenous impacts to be fully assessed.</span>

                  </a>  I thought the leader of the opposition might want to know the views of his Liberal team. On the question he asked me, as I said in answer to the shadow minister for immigration's question, we have just delivered—as the leader of the opposition may know—the Mid-Year Economic and Fiscal Outlook. In it we have delivered billions of dollars in savings to return the budget to surplus and we are on track to deliver it.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">What I would be interested to know from the leader of the opposition is whether or not, when those savings are presented to the parliament, the opposition will vote in favour of them or against them. They have been out there in the community basically saying that they are opposed to them but will they vote for them or against them? The leader of the opposition cannot be taken seriously on these questions (1) because he has not clarified that (2) because the opposition has a $70-billion black hole and (3) because the opposition is running, hiding and refusing to submit its figures to Treasury for proper costing.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">When it comes to these questions of budget management, from the days of Peter Costello to now, it has been apparent that the leader of the opposition has no credibility. And no day in opposition has served him well because there is not one day that he has bothered to make a new policy statement of substance. There is not one day that he has done a proper costing. There is not one day that he has promised to put his figures in for proper assessment. There is not one day that he said he is prepared to abide by the charter of budget honesty. Until he does so then his contributions in this debate will be weighed for their worth, which is absolutely nothing.</span>

I withdraw that the leader of the opposition read Phil Coorey's column this morning; clearly, that is not true. On the Mid-Year Economic and Fiscal Outlook, I stand by the words that I have just answered in the first part of the leader of the opposition's question. On the question of wording about surplus, I do recall the time in February where in three or four days the leader of the opposition said they would have a surplus 'as quickly as possible', the shadow minister for finance said 'it just depends', the shadow Treasurer said 'as soon as possible' and then the member of Sturt reverted to type and said he 'would have to look at the books'. Where have we heard that before? From Campbell Newman.</span>

Is the minister aware of other views on the importance of building these people-to-people links with Asia and what is the government's response?</span>

                  <a href="HV4" type="MemberAnswer">
                    <span class="HPS-MemberAnswer">Mr GARRETT</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Kingsford Smith</span>—<span class="HPS-MinisterialTitles">Minister for School Education, Early Childhood and Youth</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">14:38</span>):  I thank the member for La Trobe for her question. The government is getting on with the plan to build a modern Australia, and the Australia in the Asian Century White Paper is the plan to make sure that, as the Prime Minister said, we are a winner in the Asian century. Central to us achieving those objectives set by this government is to make sure that every student in every school is getting the best possible education they can and has the foundation of Asian languages and Asian literacy in place.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The fact is, and I think most people know it, the growth in economies like China, India and Indonesia provide fantastic opportunities for businesses and fantastic opportunities for young Australians when they come out of school and start work—high-skilled, high-wage jobs. In equipping young Australians with Asian language literacy, we know that the earlier you start a language the better. That is why we want to work with state and territory authorities to see basic language instruction starting at the very early years of school.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We also know that it is important that once a student starts they can continue on a learning path that is not interrupted. That is why we want our education stakeholders to see that students have these opportunities through their entire schooling. I am pleased to see that teachers understand this. A teacher from Corrimal High School, John Matthes, was reported in the <span style="font-style:italic;">Illawarra Mercury</span> as saying:</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Small">We should focus on these opportunities with Mandarin and Hindi, and Indonesian because Indonesia is our northern neighbour and has the fourth-largest population in the world.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">He went on to say:</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Small">Learning a second language helps you to understand your first language by helping you understand your grammar structures and how language works.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">He is right about that. Business too understands how important this is. The recent Australian Chamber of Commerce and Industry release noted that education is the key to unlocking the Asian century. They say, very simply, that a strong education and training system will lay the foundations for the future.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">This government knows it, teachers know it and business knows it. Despite some opportunistic comments by the Victorian education minister, the states know it as well. Premier O'Farrell has said that New South Wales needs to focus on Asian language development, 'as much as we need to focus on industry development.' Premier Baillieu aims to have the country's most Asia-capable workforce, including compulsory Chinese language classes, for all government school students by 2025.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">That is why we have said that we will talk to the states and territories about how we can fully implement our objectives in the Asian century white paper as part of our national plan for school improvement. Unlike the shadow Treasurer we do not see focusing on improving the opportunities for students in the Asian century as a waste of time. We are committed to doing this work and we know that Australia and Australian states understand that.</span>

                  </a>  I was being very relevant, Madam Speaker. I stand by the midyear budget update. It is important to come back to surplus to give the Reserve Bank maximum flexibility when it comes to cutting interest rates, should they decide to do so. But what is being posed here is some form of hypothetical scenario—a what if. What if something happens in the global economy? I will say this: we have a proven track record of responding to volatility in the global economy. When our country was threatened, we saved it. And who voted against that? Everybody over there. Those opposite voted against the stimulus that saved our country. They voted against it.</span>

                  </a>  We will always do the right thing by growth and jobs in our economy, unlike those opposite, who back in 2008 and 2009 voted against the stimulus package that saved jobs and kept small business in business. We have brought down a midyear budget update that brings the budget back to surplus in 2012-13 because we understand how important it is at a time of global uncertainty to bring the budget back to surplus when the economy is growing around trend.</span>

He went out today and said that there was nothing in the midyear update about the Murray-Darling. Wrong. He went out and got the growth rate wrong—again. A conga line of clangers. He said last week that the economy was flat lining. A conga line of clangers. What we have is an appropriate fiscal policy to support jobs and growth.</span>

Tackling climate change through carbon pricing is a fundamental part, in fact, of the government's dialogue with our major trading partners in the Asian region. Our trading partners in the region expect Australia—which is the 12th largest economy in the world, the 15th highest greenhouse gas emitter in the world and the highest greenhouse gas emitter in the world per capita among the advanced economies—to play a part in tackling climate change along with them. That is the simple fact of the matter.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">On that front, Korea has legislated for carbon pricing to be established through an emissions trading scheme and pilot emissions trading schemes covering about one-third of China's economy are on track to begin next year, 2013. Ultimately, the government is looking to link to these schemes in the same way that we are linking to the European Union market scheme to establish common carbon pricing and common carbon market arrangements with our major trading partners.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The opposition leaders' claims that the climate science is absolutely crap and that Australia should do nothing to reduce carbon pollution are an embarrassment for this country in our region and they risk trade retaliation. They are economically and environmentally reckless. They might have been political opportune at one point but they are not looking too good now. The fact is that carbon pricing has been settling well into our economy over the last three months and none of the absurd and mendacious predictions made by the opposition leader have come to bear at all.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">One such prediction was that there would be unimaginable price increases—it was beyond the capacity of the human mind to imagine the price impact of carbon pricing. Guess what? He was wrong, like he has been wrong on everything about carbon pricing. His mendacious claims have known no limit whatsoever. The September CPI figures show that over the last 12 months inflation is just at two per cent, bang on the bottom of the RBA's target range. How unimaginable is that? What a joke; what a total loss of credibility the opposition leader has had. We can remember him going to fish markets and claiming that there would be incredible price rises. The CPI results for fish and seafood in the September quarter was 0.1 per cent, down 0.1 per cent on 12 months ago. Honestly, it is time that those opposite started having a look at the member for Wentworth again. Even the member for North Sydney has been looking pretty hungry on <span style="font-style:italic;">Kitchen Cabinet</span>.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Lilley</span>—<span class="HPS-MinisterialTitles">Deputy Prime Minister and Treasurer</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">14:50</span>):  I have already been through in some detail the MYEFO forecasts and how the government supports those forecasts and is determined to meet them by putting in place the savings to bring the budget back to surplus in 2012-13. We are making more than $16 billion of savings in the face of very substantial revenue write downs. What I said right through last week and what I have said this week is that we will always put in place the appropriate fiscal settings to support jobs and growth in our economy. That is the point that I made last week and that is the point that I am making again today. When you have an economy that is growing around trend, that has low unemployment, that has a very substantial investment pipeline, that has low interest rates and that has contained inflation that is precisely what we should be doing and that is what we are doing.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">But the importance of that fiscal policy is not understood by those opposite, because what they have actually got is a $70 billion crater in their budget bottom line, and they are acutely embarrassed by that fact.</span>

                  </a>  What I have been doing is outlining our commitment to good, firm fiscal policy, and it is not a commitment that is shared by those opposite, because they have a $70 billion crater in their budget bottom line and they have form: an $11 billion hole in the estimates they took to the last election—they had a company that was fined for professional misconduct during that campaign. And we have seen more of that professional misconduct through the life of this parliament by their refusal, when they say they have all their policies ready, to take them over to the Parliamentary Budget Office and have them costed.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The fact is that we are implementing good fiscal policy that supports jobs and growth in the Australian economy, and at every turn we are opposed by those opposite, who are completely reckless and day after day after day talk our economy down. We will get on with the job of making the savings, coming back to surplus and supporting the forecast we have put in place through the mid-year budget update. But what we will not see from them is a commitment to the same fiscal policy by their giving support in this House for our savings.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Small">The alternative—meandering back to surplus—would compound the pressures in our economy and push up the cost of living for pensioners and working people.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">So, the Treasurer said in this place on budget night, before the Australian people, that 'meandering back to surplus'—that is, avoiding a surplus—will put pressure on our economy and push up the cost of living for pensioners and working people. These weasel words.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We know this: the document that gets the greatest workout in the Prime Minister's office is a thesaurus. Every time, they try to look for a different word to describe a potential surplus. You get your 'promise', you get your 'guarantee', you get your 'commitment', you get your 'road map', you get your 'path' and you get your 'plan'. But this is a government that has not delivered a surplus and I suspect it never will deliver a surplus. It will never deliver an honest surplus because it is fiddling the numbers, and fiddling them writ large.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">There is deceit on that side of the House when it comes to the budget, and the government is incapable of telling the truth to the Australian people. It should be held accountable in this place, and the Australian people should be holding it to account for its failure to properly manage the budget. Every single step of the way Labor engages more in spin, more in subterfuge, than it does in being honest and truthful with the Australian people. These are the same taxpayers who are in the gallery, the same taxpayers who are listening to this debate, the same taxpayers who have to repay up to $257 billion of gross debt. They are the same taxpayers who get hit with flood levies, who get hit with the mining tax and the carbon tax. They are the same taxpayers who have faced 26 new or increased taxes since Labor has come into government, the same taxpayers who are facing the intergenerational challenges that Labor is refusing to deal with, particularly in areas like industrial relations and dealing with productivity.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The Labor Party has plans; it has lots of plans. This week it delivered a plan for the Asian century. The only problem was that the plan had no money. I have heard of a tax with no revenue, I have heard of a plan with no money and I have even heard of schools with no students and hospitals with no patients. I have also heard of a government with no credibility. And I have heard of a government and a Treasurer with no honesty—none. They are bereft of honesty, bereft of personal integrity, because they do not have the capacity to stand before the Australian people and be honest. Instead, they held it as a massive badge of honour. They would deliver the surplus. They would turn around the forgotten years of Kevin Rudd. They would turn them all around. It was a government that had lost its way: 'We'll get it back on track; we will deliver a surplus.'</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">And of course, true to form, Labor has not delivered a surplus since 1989—before the member for Longman was born. The member for Longman was not even born in the time of a Labor surplus. Mobile phones were not even conceived back when Labor last delivered a surplus. But now, rest assured. The Prime Minister says, 'We have a plan.' The Prime Minister says, 'We're on track.' But it is a track going nowhere. It is a track familiar to Burke and Wills; 150 years ago they lost their way. They will find their way to a surplus. Burke and Wills will deliver a surplus at the very same time that the Labor Party will deliver a surplus. We have only been waiting 150 years thus far.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">And of course we know they briefed Phil Coorey at the <span style="font-style:italic;">Sydney Morning Herald</span>. Far be it from me to give him a pat on the back for anything, but on this occasion I will break new ground. And I say to you: we know the Treasurer was briefing the <span style="font-style:italic;">Sydney Morning Herald</span> to look at the key components of MYEFO to walk away from a surplus. We know that—deceitfully walking away from a surplus. And in doing so the government has undermined not just its own words but its actions. They claim to have $16 billion of saves this financial year, but 80 per cent of those are increased taxes for the Australian people. That is not a save; that is a punishment.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The Australian people have had enough of the deceit. The Australian people have had enough of the untruths. The Australian people have had enough of promises and plans, commitments—all the other weasel words. The bottom line is that the Labor Party must deliver. It must actually deliver on its words if it is to be trusted. And if we have a government that cannot be trusted, bring on an election and get a government that can be trusted with the nation's economy.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">
                  <a href="FU4" type="MemberSpeech">
                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Mr ROBB</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Goldstein</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">15:03</span>):  I second the motion. Standing orders should be suspended, because the final fig leaf hiding Labor's incompetence and economic ineptitude is withering before our eyes. The surplus is dead. Despite Labor's best efforts at budget fiddles and budget fraudulence, this government is finally being bludgeoned by the fiscal consequence of years of reckless spending. The government is squirming away from its non-negotiable promise to deliver a surplus. The pretence of having your cake and eating it as well has been exposed—and doesn't everybody know it.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Standing orders need to be suspended, because we see today that only one in four Australians believe that Labor will be able to deliver its promise to get back into the black before the election. One in four, 25 per cent of Australians only, believe that this government can deliver a surplus—will get back into the black—after years of economic growth, after the biggest boom in our history, after terms of trade that were at 150-year highs, after an increase in commodity prices of only 350 per cent! Yet they still cannot deliver a surplus, and 75 per cent of Australians can see straight through the rhetoric of this government, see the emptiness of Labor's economic promises.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">That is why standing orders must be suspended. There is a crisis of confidence right across the community; there has been now for 18 months to two years: 13 per cent of all disposable income across 7½ million households is being saved, because people have no confidence to spend money. No wonder retail is on its knees. That is $120 billion taken out of the economy in one year in savings. Why? The only reason is that people have no confidence that this government will do what it says it will do. Seventy-five per cent today confirmed that they do not believe that this government will deliver a surplus. They do not believe any of the nonsense this government has been peddling in budget after budget—the shonky forecasts, the endless spending, the reckless spending. It goes on and on and on.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The economic fraudulence of this government was so starkly exposed when, as my colleague said, within a day of the release of the Mid-Year Economic and Fiscal Outlook, it was revealed that the first quarter's payment of the resources super tax was a bit fat zero. The Treasurer became the first Treasurer in history to initiate a tax that does not actually raise any money! In fact, we are told that it could in the years ahead lead to the payment of money back to companies. This is a oncer; this is a first.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The important thing is that walking away from a surplus does have major consequences. It will result in more unfunded spending. It will open the floodgates to spending. The $120 billion black hole is only the start of it—this will open the floodgates for more spending. We have heard it today, with the Asia vision: billions of dollars being promised at this dispatch box, by implication. Where is that coming from? It is on top of the $120 billion black hole. We will see more borrowing, more debt, more issuing of government bonds, more pressure on the Australian dollar.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Penny Wong, the finance minister, said in her first speech that 'this government has made it clear that the return to surplus is not negotiable'. Well, this government is crab-walking away from that promise, made over 150 times in the last two years. The backflip over this non-negotiable commitment to deliver a surplus is leaving Australia more vulnerable, more exposed—we need a change of government if we are to remove the crisis of confidence that is so endemic in our community. <span style="font-style:italic;">(Time expired)</span></span>

It is very difficult following this duo over here, the shadow Treasurer and the shadow finance minister, who contradicted each other from the mover and seconder of this motion. We had a little showpiece from Joe. It would have been better if he had the tutu and the wand. But he stood up here and he had is own little fantasy. What we have here is motion to suspend standing orders. That is what is before this House right now. And in spite of the fact that the shadow Treasurer did not mention the need for a suspension of standing orders, we let that go through to the keeper—because we are generous people on this side of the House, and we thought we'd give him a go—it is a fact that, if these standing orders are suspended, you'll knock over the matter of public importance, and the matter of public importance is from the member for North Sydney on the same topic that he has moved the suspension of standing orders on! So when this suspension is knocked over, because it does not get an absolute majority, he will have to stand up and give the same speech! It is absolutely, extraordinarily incompetent for a tactics committee that decides in advance to have typed out suspensions of standing orders to not give consideration to what comes next—to what it knocks off if the suspension is carried. What an absolute farce.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The member for North Sydney raised Laurie Oakes. I am pleased he did raise Laurie Oakes, because Laurie Oakes wrote a cracker of an article on Saturday, where he fingered the shadow Treasurer for his incompetence: 'Voters entitled to a bit more honesty', is what Laurie Oakes had to say. And he said:</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Small">The policy bigwigs who heard Joe Hockey's provocative speech to the Institute of Economic Affairs in London back in April could hardly help but be impressed. He spoke about the age of entitlement being over.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">That is what he had to say in London. But this is what Laurie Oakes says about Joe Hockey back on home turf:</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Small">If Hockey was fair dinkum about what he said in London he would have welcomed the Baby Bonus and Health Insurance Rebate savings. Instead, like Abbott, he saw an opportunity to score political points and grabbed it.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">And that is all that we see from those opposite. Every single day is just about the politics of the day, let alone the politics of the month or the year or the term in parliament; it is all about the politics of the day. And that is why this motion should be knocked off, and there should not be a suspension of standing orders, because this is pure indulgence from those opposite. They say they are worried about the age of entitlement—according to the shadow Treasurer—but back here say the opposite.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">It is just like the Leader of the Opposition who, when he is here, says the economy is crumbling and there is crisis—the carbon price was going to ruin the economy. But when he goes overseas, he talks the economy up and has to acknowledge how well this government's economic management is. And let us have a look at how good it is compared with the Howard era: unemployment, lower under Labor; inflation, lower under Labor; home loan mortgage rates, lower under Labor; wages growth, higher under Labor; household savings, higher under Labor; taxes as a percentage of GDP, lower under Labor; government spending, lower under Labor; business investment, higher under Labor; the investment pipeline, through the roof under Labor, with the confidence in this economy; infrastructure spending, higher under Labor; industrial disputes, lower under Labor; labour force participation, higher under Labor—on every single economic indicator, this government has outperformed the former government.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I noticed the Leader of the Opposition yesterday, in an op-ed piece in the <span style="font-style:italic;">Australian Financial Review</span>, speaking about his vision for the future. And what did he have to say? 'If you want to look at the direction for the future, you've got to look in the past'. That is the problem with this bloke and those opposite. Not only are they incapable of embracing the future; they are incapable of acknowledging the present, because they are stuck in the past, they have been engage in an unrelenting dummy-spit since they failed to form government in 2010.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">And then they have the hide to speak about budget surpluses and deficits. Well, they can get fair dinkum: they can vote for our savings. They have got all these unfunded promises. They have not even bothered to look at the detail in MYEFO. Let us have a look at what the shadow Treasurer has had to say. He said the Murray-Darling Basin Plan was not in MYEFO—wrong, wrong, wrong. He said terms of trade are at a record high—wrong. Then he went on to say: </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Small">… you have trend growth of 3 to 3.5 per cent on their projections, which I think is a little generous …</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Wrong. If he had bothered to read MYEFO, he would know what GDP growth is forecast to be. The fact is that those opposite have absolutely no credibility when it comes to the economic debate of this country. The Leader of the Opposition, when it came to their budget black hole, had this to say, when he was asked about it:</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Small">… it is absolutely fanciful.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">And yet, just a couple of weeks later, the shadow finance minister, when asked about it on <span style="font-style:italic;">Meet the Press</span> on 4 September, said:</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">

                <span class="HPS-Normal">So he has said that they are trying to book the savings and then that they are not available. They are completely all over the shop when it comes to these issues. That is why this week they have been like a broken record. They are like a band who have run out of hits. What we saw yesterday was that they sat around in the morning and they said, 'Are there any new ideas?' 'No,' they said—their favourite word—'No, no, no.' So they went back to a greatest hits collection. We had carbon pricing, we had boats and we had dirt. Today they went to a different strategy. Today, after their caucus meeting—where they had divisions about wheat, divisions about water, divisions about all of their strategies—they decided, 'We'll just go for the mud bucket straight up.' So they went for the mud bucket in question 1. That did not work. They went for smear in question 2. That did not work, so they just got right down there in the gutter, right up-front. They just have not got the message that the Australian people see this bloke as destructively negative, with nothing to say about the future of this country. There was not a single question this week about the Asian century white paper—not a question. It is absolutely extraordinary. And now they have the hide to say— <span style="font-style:italic;">(Time expired)</span></span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">North Sydney</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">15:29</span>):  I am sorry that the Treasurer has not deemed it fit to debate the economy in this place. We warned that this would happen; we have been saying it for months and years. When the government brought forward the Mid-Year Economic and Fiscal Outlook to October, for only the third time in the history of MYEFO, we smelt a rat. The two previous occasions on which MYEFO has been released in October, barely five months into the financial year, were with the announcement of an election pending in November. Those were the only two times. And noting that MYEFO is a document produced by the Treasurer and the Minister for Finance, rather than the Treasury and the Department of Finance, we were highly sceptical and we were understandably cautious. MYEFO has been released in November on seven occasions, five times in December and only twice previously in October—and now they bring it forward.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">And then we worked it out. Oh, what a coincidence! We discovered that the mining tax receipts were going to be lodged with the Australian Taxation Office, on the other side of Canberra, at exactly the same time as the government was publishing this document. What a coincidence! Get out of here! How did that happen? The government said it had revised the mining tax number from $3 billion down to $2 billion. Old Swannie knew the questions were coming but he still did not get the numbers right. But we will let him off the hook for a brief moment because there are much bigger fish to put on our hook.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The government said it was going to get to a surplus of $1.1 billion. How? By fiddling the books. Labor is great at fiddling the books. The Health Services Union was good at fiddling the books. Charges have been laid against a former president of the Labor Party, suggesting that there may have been some fiddling of the books. And now we have got the Treasurer of the Labor Party fiddling the books. He is doing that by moving money between years—that is the time honoured trick. Of course, if you are a director of an Australian company you would probably go to jail for that. But, never mind, he is the Treasurer of Australia. Then he brings $2 billion of the Future Fund into the budget to deliver him over $417 million this financial year. And then he goes and raids the superannuation accounts of everyday Australians to get another $500 million. He does a fiddle here and a fiddle there and, hocus-pocus, we have got 'a promised surplus'. It is now 'a plan to have a surplus', according to the Prime Minister. It was 'a 'commitment, it was 'a promise' and it was 'a guarantee'. And then we had a little charade with the government saying it was 'a determination'. 'Maybe we'll get there; we hope to get there; goodness knows, we might get there; no, we're going to get there.'</span>

                  </a>  It is a scene out of <span style="font-style:italic;">Thomas the Tank Engine</span>—something that I, with young children, am all too familiar with. But the evidence of this government's incompetence knows no bounds. We have heard it all before. They promised they would have computers in schools for $1 billion. Well, that was $2.2 billion and the dollars have not finished. They said they were going to have a green car fund, and they did not have a green car fund. They said they were going to send $900 cheques out to people—and they sent over 18,000 cheques to dead people to stimulate the economy! They put pink batts in people's homes. Homes burnt down and there were tragic deaths associated with it, and then they had to spend billions of dollars trying to fix the problem. They had $500 digital set-top boxes put into pensioners homes—when Gerry Harvey said he would personally do it for $199. We have had it all before. Nothing stretches the imagination with this government. As one of their own members said to me last night, this government will go down in the annals of history as a memorable government. And I said, 'Amen, it will be memorable.' The only problem is that the Australian people are paying a price for a government that is deceiving them with words, misleading them with actions and, at the end of the day, undermining consumer and business confidence with their own incompetence.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Remember the mining tax? We will never let Labor forget the mining tax. This tax was originally going to raise over $11 billion in two years; in fact, at one stage it was meant to be $23 billion over four years. And then it was reduced. 'Sorry, Kevin lost his way. We're going to have to get rid of Kevin.' 'I will negotiate a new mining tax,' the new Prime Minister, Julia Gillard, said. 'Put down your weapons; stop your advertising; come to the table where we can negotiate.' I would love to negotiate with Julia Gillard; I would love it. The Malaysians negotiated with Julia Gillard. They ended up sending 3,000 people here and, in return, got 600 people and over $300 million. How good is that for negotiating with the Prime Minister of Australia! But then along came the three most significant iron ore and coal companies in Australia, two of whom are among the most significant mining companies in the world—they negotiate with China and throughout the region with the most aggressive negotiators in the world—and the Prime Minister says: 'I'm going to take Wayne Swan into these negotiations. I'm going to take old Swannie in. There's no negotiator like Wayne Swan. He's the best. He deserves a gold medal in the negotiation Olympics.' So in goes the Prime Minister, to negotiate with the three toughest negotiators in the commercial world, with Wayne Swan by her side and Martin Ferguson on the other side. When they came out they said, 'We've done a great deal.' When the miners came out they said, 'We can live with this tax.' All of a sudden the alarm bells went off. The miners said it was a pretty good deal. I thought, 'Hang on, what's "a pretty good deal"?' Do you know what a pretty good deal is? Zero tax. That is a pretty good deal!</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I have heard of all those stories about expenditure blow-outs, about promises made and not delivered, but I have never heard of a tax that does not raise money. Not even the Greek government has heard of a tax that does not raise money. This government has set a new public policy benchmark right across the world: a tax with no money. But it gets better.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">If the tax has no money then everyone is asking the question, 'Well, what happened to the rebate for the royalties paid to the states?' And we hear from the mining companies and we hear from everyone else that in fact the royalties are rebatable. So not only is this tax so far, to the best of our knowledge, not delivering a dollar; the government has a liability to pay the miners money. This is a tax where the government pays money rather than receives money. Now that is a second-year benchmark in public policy that this government has delivered and it is writ large.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">I go back to the words of the original architect of the reform. Dr Ken Henry, who is a decent man, said along the way that the mining tax would be important for helping to redistribute the wealth. But Dr Henry on 16 July this year said:</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">with the mining tax. The problem is that the government does not understand what has been legislated with the mining tax. We understand it. We understand that the mining tax was a false dawn. The problem is that this government committed over $15 billion of expenditure against a tax that does not exist—$15 billion in schoolkids bonuses, regional infrastructure funds, superannuation increases, concessions to small business. They are running around the country talking about redistributing the wealth of the mining boom, but there ain't no wealth.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">And why? Because of the sheer incompetence of this government and the deliberate deceit in their words and their sneaky little actions in bringing forward a document to avoid telling the truth to the Australian people about the state of the budget. It is consistent with all of their actions, consistent with all of their words—the Labor Party does not tell the truth. They come in here and cry crocodile tears about budget cuts and job losses in Queensland and then they cut the education budget. They say that they are going to provide billions of dollars to the Gonski reforms. Not a dollar exists. In fact, they are cutting education.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">They cry crocodile tears about the funding of health in Australia, which in the last year alone for everyday Australians has gone up over seven per cent. The ABS identified on Thursday that one of the key reasons for the increase in the cost of health was in fact the government's own previous actions to try and close down private health insurance support in the budget. The ABS, the most unpolitical of organisations, is there saying government policy has caused the cost of health in Australia to rise by over seven per cent and in the last quarter to rise significantly, and that is because of the government's policy changes on private health insurance. Not to be outdone, this government then goes and takes a further $1.1 billion out of private health insurance.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Did you notice that before MYEFO they had all of this feigned concern for low-income Australians? One million Australians earning less than $24,000 a year are private health insurance policy holders, and this government has now announced a further new policy that is forevermore going to continue to increase private health insurance. Their complete contempt for private health insurance is best displayed by the way they treat their own private health insurer, Medibank Private. They have taken out $800 million in special dividends over the last three years, including this year alone—$250 per policy holder out of Medibank Private to try and shore up their fake surplus.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">This is a government that will reach into any pocket. Previously, we know, they have raised taxes with complete indifference to the impact on prices and the costs of goods, complete indifference to the welfare of the nation—carbon tax, flood levy, alcopops tax, changes in so many areas. There have been 27, in fact, new or increased taxes. They do not care. They see your money as their money. But, what is worse, just a few months ago the Labor Party introduced over $5 billion of retrospective taxes. So, not sick of hitting people with new taxes now, they go back and hit people with yesterday's taxes, where they lawfully pay the taxes because the Labor Party has run out of money. Then they borrowed money, which is future taxes. They borrowed from the Australian people. They give us this line about how the Labor Party collects less as a percentage of GDP in tax than the previous coalition. We did not borrow money, because borrowing money is future taxes. If the Labor Party do not understand it then their ignorance shows no bounds.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The problem is the total lack of honesty, the total deceit from this mob, the contempt they hold everyday Australians in. Because Labor has no core principles. They do not understand that every dollar borrowed is a dollar that has to be paid back with interest. And they do not understand that when they increase taxes they hit everyday Australians. Labor, at some point, sometime in the future, must tell the truth, because ultimately bad Labor governments are going to be caught out.</span>

                  <a href="HVW" type="MemberSpeech">
                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Mr BRADBURY</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Lindsay</span>—<span class="HPS-MinisterialTitles">Assistant Treasurer and Minister Assisting for Deregulation</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">15:44</span>):  I am pleased to be able to contribute to this matter of public importance. I will restate the subject of it, because it may not have been possible to glean that from the member for North Sydney's contribution. The topic for discussion is:</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Small">The failure of the Government to deliver an economic and fiscal plan to return the Budget to surplus in its 2012-13 MYEFO statement.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We heard from the member for North Sydney a range of criticisms about the timing of the mid-year economic statement. I think it is worth putting a few facts on the record. I hope that the weight of facts can overpower the sheer force of hot air that we have heard from the other side. I will ensure that this debate is graced with at least some facts.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">In terms of the question of timing, the absolute hypocrisy of the member for North Sydney may have dawned on one or two members in this chamber. The last time I debated him in a matter of public importance, in the last sitting week, the topic was that the government should urgently update its forecasts. That was just a few weeks ago. It was such a significant matter—he should go back and review the videotape. Obviously on that occasion he strayed as far away from the topic as he has today. He came into this place and said, 'The government needs to urgently update its figures.' Guess what—we did. It is called the Mid-Year Economic and Fiscal Outlook. We handed that down just over a week ago.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The member for North Sydney says, 'The government rushed in and released it earlier than we would've expected.' That statement might have an ounce of credibility if this was not the same bloke who last year ran around the country saying the government released it too late. On that occasion we released it on 29 November, and his principal criticism was, 'You can't go and release the mid-year statement when there are virtually no sitting weeks of parliament left, because we need to make sure this plan of yours is subject to some parliamentary scrutiny.' Hello! This is the second last sitting week of the year. If this is too early, the member for North Sydney needs to tell us exactly when he thinks is an appropriate time to hand down the mid-year economic statement.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">When the member for North Sydney was in government and he and his colleagues introduced the Charter of Budget Honesty, they set out the requirements for the mid-year statement. This mid-year statement complies with the Charter of Budget Honesty. We did not hear any reference to the Charter of Budget Honesty from the member for North Sydney in his contribution because not only did he fail to comply with the requirements of the Charter of Budget Honesty at the last election but he has absolutely no intention of doing so at the next election.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We all recall the $11 billion black hole at the last election. His policies were costed by people he called his mates—he said he got mates rates. Whatever he got, he either really got his money's worth or he got completely ripped off, depending on what he was really trying to do. The people that costed and audited his policies—he said that they audited them—were found to have an $11 billion black hole. The accounting firm were reprimanded by the professional body and the member for North Sydney, the member for Goldstein and the Leader of the Opposition were exposed for having gone to the election with a shonky set of costings. They thought they were going to slide through. But what happened? No-one had the numbers after the election, and there was a period of negotiation. The Independents, in their wisdom, decided that they would make sure they got the policies costed. Mind you, they would already have been costed if the coalition had observed the principles that they had had set out for years. They had been coming into this place for years and saying everybody must kneel at the altar of the Charter of Budget Honesty, but they did not do it. At the first opportunity, they would not do it.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We heard the member for North Sydney talk about the timing of this MYEFO. Let me talk about the history of the timing of some of the Mid-Year Economic Statements handed down. Let's look at the so-called 'golden years' of the Costello reign. In that period, two MYEFOs were handed down in October, one on 15 October 2007 and one on 17 October 2001. We are hearing that October is too early, yet Costello did it twice. Let's have a look at some of the other dates. There was a MYEFO handed down on 21 December 2004—that was a Christmas present, was it? Santa delivered that one, and he decided to make sure it arrived just in time! There was a bit of bad news in that one. That is why they held it back and released it just on the eve of Christmas. If that is the standard you want us to observe, come on, challenge us to do it. I tell you what: we won't, because we believe it is important that the Australian people have access to this information in a timely way. There were Mid-Year Economic Statements handed down on 15 December 2005 and then 20 December 2006. How much parliamentary scrutiny did those get subjected to, being handed down in December, on the eve of Christmas?</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">That is the hypocrisy of those opposite, the same people with their shonky costings exposed from an $11 billion black hole. If it stopped there, you might at least come to the conclusion that they have reformed, they have seen the error of their ways. But we know they have a $70 billion black hole. The member for North Sydney has gone on breakfast television twice to tell us that and the member for Goldstein will tell anyone that will listen. Along with all of the other shortcomings of the member for North Sydney and the member for Goldstein, they do not talk, but they do talk about each other—that's for sure—to anyone that will listen.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We handed down our Mid-Year Economic Statement, containing, across the forward estimates, $16 billion worth of responsible savings measures, to ensure that we are able to chart a pathway back to surplus. There is a forecast surplus of $1.1 billion in the current year, and that surplus is forecast to increase across the forward estimates. As part of this we announced a whole series of significant structural changes to the budget to make sure that it will be fiscally sustainable over time. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">And you would have thought that, given all the chest-beating that we saw when the member for North Sydney went over to the UK—he gave his speech on the age of entitlement, big man that he was!—he was going to clamp down on the age of entitlement and to undo all the middle-class welfare of the Howard years. He said that on <span style="font-style:italic;">Lateline</span>. He was going to undo all of the damage that was done by the largesse of the Howard years.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Then he had an opportunity, when we handed down this Mid-Year Economic statement, where we said that we were going to trim the baby bonus for the second child and for subsequent children. We are not taking it away but will reduce it to $3,000 for child 2 and beyond, except if they are multiple births. You would have thought that a decision of this nature would have the wholehearted support of someone who purports to have some interest in the long-term fiscal sustainability of our budget. But instead the member for North Sydney came forward and started likening this to the one-child policy in China. When he was asked about this on<span style="font-style:italic;"> Insiders</span><span style="font-style:italic;">,</span> he said: 'Hang on a minute. Never before in the history of Australia has a family been penalised for having subsequent children.'</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I might be missing something here, but I do not think $3,000 payments are a penalty. They are called bonuses; they are to support people in those situations. He went on to say, 'Never before have we treated the first child differently to subsequent children.' He must have forgotten about the first-child tax offset that his government, when they were last in government, introduced back in 2000-01. For those of you who may not have looked at the detail of the act or the policy behind it, I reckon the first-child tax offset may have been about the first child! And if it was about the first child and the subsequent children were not entitled to it then I reckon that, in government, the opposition may have just done exactly what he reckons no government in the history of this country has ever done. Once again, he is being very sloppy and very lazy when it comes to his details.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The opposition talk about our commitment to a surplus. One of the biggest threats to a surplus is the coalition, because every time we come forward with a sensible savings measure they want to play politics. They know it is not easy. If you want to get the government on a sustainable footing—if you want to do what the member for North Sydney said has to be done, and that is to trim away some of the largesse of the Howard years—then sometimes you have to make some decisions that are not easy. But in opposition they take the low road every time. They oppose these things. They whinge; they whine—there is no shortage of hot air from the member for North Sydney—and then, when it comes to the crunch, they either quietly wave these measures through or vote against them. But you never, ever hear them say that they will come forward and reinstate these things, because they will let us do the hard work. They are happy to let us do the heavy lifting, and they think that their moment in the sun is not far away. I will tell you what: the Australian people will demand of them a little bit more hard work than we have seen. They will demand a lot less of the sloppiness and a lot less of the laziness and little bit more hard work.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">When it comes to the surplus, the opposition talk about the surplus as if a coalition government will automatically return the budget to surplus. You would have thought that from listening to the member for North Sydney. But when they have been asked about whether or not they are prepared to commit to returning the budget to surplus, what do they say? The Leader of the Opposition says, 'We'll do it as quickly as possible.' The member for Goldstein over here says, 'It just depends.' That sounds a little bit more equivocal. The member for North Sydney says, 'We'll do it as soon as possible.' He did not say, 'as quickly as possible'; he said, 'as soon as possible'. That is not too bad. Senator Abetz says, 'Hang on a minute. I'm not in the business of making extravagant promises.' So do they intend to return the budget to surplus or not?</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The member for North Sydney came in here and he was talking about 'this high-taxing government' increasing taxes and retrospective taxes. Well, there is only one party in this parliament that has a plan to increase corporate taxes. It is a $12 billion monster parental leave tax, and the architect was none other than the Leader of the Opposition. Remember, he went into the party room, and we know that the opposition hated it. Look at the member for Goldstein; he is shifting uncomfortably in his seat, because they hate it. Think about this. If the Labor Party were proposing to increase corporate taxes on $3,000 of the biggest companies in this country by 1½ per cent so that we can fund a social expenditure program they would be saying, 'It's a return to the socialist ways of the Labor Party!' When the Leader of the Opposition proposed the tax they were not happy, so he went into the party room and said, 'Sometimes it's better to ask for forgiveness than permission.' They might have granted him forgiveness on that occasion but one gets the sense that they are running out of patience with his constant requests for forgiveness ahead of permission. One gets the sense that that is the case.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Why is that the case? It is not because they are taking a stand on any great principle, but some opposition members actually get out there and talk to people in their communities, and they are sensing the same thing that so many members of this place are sensing: that the Australian people are sick and tired—they have had a gutful—of the reckless negativity of this bloke. Never before have I seen a leader's standing in the polls dragging so heavily on a party's standing as what we have seen with the Leader of the Opposition. I am no genius—I will be the first to admit that—so I am not the only one who can see that. There must be people on the other side of the chamber who can see it as well. That is why the members in the chamber have conveniently started looking at their shoes at this point in time: they do not want to make eye contact because they know the truth of this. The Australian people have worked the Leader of the Opposition out. They have decided that his reckless negativity is not what this country needs in the future. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The Australian people are looking for a plan for the future. And on the weekend the Prime Minister set out a plan for our future—for how we can take advantage of the dramatic changes that are occurring in the global economy, bringing so much opportunity for prosperity to our doorstep. But it will not just land in our lap; we are going to have to work hard to achieve it. And we have a plan to do that.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Meanwhile, not only did those on the other side not come into this place and ask any sensible questions about MYEFO, or tell us which measures they intend to support and which ones they are going to oppose, but they did not even ask us a question about the Asian century, our plan or what we intend to do. The only contribution they can make is to say well, you have not committed enough money to it. The people that are jumping up and down saying this is a government that spends too much money are now telling us 'you have not committed enough money'. We have sensible plans and we will deliver them. <span style="font-style:italic;">(Time expired)</span></span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Goldstein</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">16:00</span>):  Wouldn't you know it? This happens every time. I seem to follow the Assistant Treasurer, the member for Lindsay, every time we have a matter of public importance, which gives him an opportunity to defend the position of the government. He did not spend one second defending any position of the government. It was just another exercise in cheap shots, anecdotes and all the rest. As usual, he scurries off. It is a fruitless exercise but it does reinforce the point about this whole debate—that is, that the failure to outline a plan to return to surplus in MYEFO is yet again just another symbol, another example of the failure now for many years to present any sort of vision, any sort of road map as to where they are taking the country. That is why there is a crisis of confidence in Australia. That is why people are saving like there is no tomorrow. That is why businesses are sitting on, in many cases, very healthy balance sheets. There is no confidence about investing in this country and it largely stems from the absence of leadership.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">There is failure, from the Prime Minister down, to articulate what this government will do not just to deal with the problems but to set us up for the opportunities. How can adding $257 billion of debt to Australia—and growing—be consistent with the rhetoric we heard over the weekend about Asia? We have the minister responsible for Asia now in the House. How can Australia properly take advantage of what should be a miraculous, spectacular three decades—in my view—if we are burdened with the highest debt this country has ever had? If you add federal and state debt together, we have nearly half a trillion dollars of debt and it is growing. There is nothing in the MYEFO or in the budget before it which shows that this government has any idea, has any prospect, has any concept of how it is going to take Australia to a better place. On 30 August this year the <span style="font-style:italic;">Australian Financial Review</span> wrote a telling editorial in which it observed:</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Small">… going forward, the budget is facing a black hole of colossal proportions and Labor has no strategy to deal with it.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">That is what the community thinks. Here is a government now with a black hole of colossal proportions. This is after, by the way, years of growth. Farmers will tell you that if you have a bunch of good seasons in a row then you put hay away for when you need it, when the bad season comes.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">This government keeps telling us about trend growth and we do know that we have had the biggest mining boom and 150 years. Compared with the rest of the world, we are so blessed yet we have a debt going through the ceiling; we have a government with a colossal black hole. We saw not one thing in the budget which suggested how this government would pay for $120 billion of commitments that it floated are going to be made in the years ahead.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">You watch at the next election the National Disability Insurance Scheme. The government will claim credit for having introduced it. We are so far away from it that it does not matter. It is a con on the Australian public but, most importantly, on the most disadvantaged people in our community. They are being misled to believe that it is just around the corner, that it is funded and that it is deliverable. This government has no moral fibre. To go out there and mislead people in this way is a disgrace, an absolute disgrace. It is because, as the <span style="font-style:italic;">Financial Review</span> said, Labor has no strategy to deal with it, none whatsoever.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We saw nothing from the member for Lindsay. The Assistant Treasurer, would you believe, had 15 minutes to quietly and confidently articulate a case for the plan they have got to deliver a surplus. What did we hear? Nothing but cheap shots straight out of the Labor-union book of how to play politics. It is a game to them. It is game of politics, it is not about using politics to get in good policy. It is about playing with people's minds and with policy to deliver politics and power. That is the objective.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">This absence of a plan or strategy that the <span style="font-style:italic;">Financial Review</span> spoke about and the growing colossal black hole that the <span style="font-style:italic;">Financial Review</span> also spoke about on August 23 are not new developments. The failure of this government to outline a plan to return Australia to surplus has been with us for some time as have the growing consequences.  I am not normally in the habit of quoting myself but I thought it would be instructive to remind people of what we on this side of the House and so many others over the last two or three years have been saying. It is instructive to go back and see what the nature of this debate was two years ago. I quote from a speech I gave on 16 February 2011. Right back then they were making cast-iron promises about a surplus in 2012-13 and it helped them get through the 2010 election.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">They forecast nirvana. They forecast these things and then, when they do not happen, say, 'We've had to deal with some setbacks.' A 150-year high in terms of trade—what a setback that was! That was really bad luck! A 350 per cent increase in commodity prices—oh, shock, horror! How bad is that, to have to deal with those sorts of problems! I feel so sorry! But to go back to what was said nearly two years ago:</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Small">Any "illusory" surplus in 2012-13 ignores the spending commitments being made during the boom times that still need to be met when the boom tapers off and revenues fall.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We were talking about terms of trade coming off—not collapsing but coming off—two years ago. But what did the government do? It ignored this advice. I went on to say:</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Small">On top of that, several leading economists claimed last week that a potential $7.4bn black hole existed in the mining tax forecasts due to the "highly risky" revenue stream.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Here we are: leading officials, leading business people and leading economists were warning two years ago that this mining tax was not going to deliver a cent. But the government blithely went on. They have been beating their breasts. They have been lying and obfuscating and misleading the population again and again and again.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">In that same speech I went on:</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Small">As a consequence of the blowout in the structural deficit, the cloud over the amount and volatility of the mining tax revenue and the potential collapse of revenue if the terms of trade drop … Swan and Penny Wong must guarantee full disclosure of the estimated structural deficit in this year's budget papers.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">Well, of course, all of that is what we have seen in the last two years. The government has not responded to any of it. We have a government that has no direction and must be gone.</span>

                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Mr RIPOLL</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Oxley</span>—<span class="HPS-MinisterialTitles">Parliamentary Secretary to the Treasurer</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">16:10</span>):  It is a pleasure, once again, to speak on these matters of public importance—although they are the same matter over and over and over, and you would think that the opposition would just be a little bit more creative and come up with something that was a little bit more innovative in terms of the things they are trying to say. But if their only claim coming in here to speak on this matter of public importance is that we do not have a plan, then how sad it is for the opposition. Is this the new brains trust of the Liberal and National parties? Is this all they have left to offer? They may criticise us for the plans we do have; they may make some critique of that. But to say that we have no plan I think is a little odd and a little strange.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We are still waiting to see what their policies are in a whole range of areas. We want to not only see the policies but see them costed properly. We want to see them handed over to the office of budget honesty to see what we can actually make of what the opposition is proposing for the future of Australia.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">But let us go to some of the key facts and see what this economy actually looks like. The rest of the world and we are going through some difficult times; there is no question about that. Since the GFC hit the world, we have all had to make some pretty tough decisions and weather some fairly tough circumstances. And that is exactly what we have done as a government. Since we were elected to government in 2007, this Labor government has made all of the tough calls, all of the tough decisions, to make sure we have plans in place. We have put the right budgets and spending in place to make sure that we support the economy and support jobs. We have made sure that people still have work to go to. We have made sure that business can stand on its own feet, with the assistance of government in the right areas, to make sure that we still have a strong, decent economy. That is a good position to be in. We are in a good position in this country.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">When people get together for a barbecue and discuss things then, yes, they will have a bit of a complain about where the economy is at, and, yes, it could always be better, there is no question. But when you ask them the central question: 'If you could pick any economy in the world, if you could pick any place to be, where would you rather be?' The answer is, 'Right here.' Because they understand the tough times that we have all gone through, and they understand the work that this government has done to make sure that we still have a good economy—an economy that is still performing well by anybody's measure.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">But let us have a little look at where this opposition was not so long ago. I can recall, back in the Costello and Howard years, the so-called 'greatness' of that particular government—and, in the fullness of time, maybe we will see just what that 'greatness' really amounted to. I also recall that there was one thing that was really significant about that period in history, and not just for Australia but for all our neighbours, for every OECD country, and for the world. We were experiencing a global boom, beyond any proportions anyone had ever seen before—so much so that some economists were talking about redesigning the parameters of the charts, because everything only ever pointed up back then.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">In those days, they used to call them the 'rivers of gold' that flowed into Canberra. It used to rain gold bars. And there was a deliberate tactic of the then Treasurer, Peter Costello, in those boom years of gold bars just raining down on Canberra, to always underestimate just how big the surplus might be, how much would be left over no matter how much they spent, because they knew there was always just a bit more revenue coming in the front door. So it was really easy. I reckon I could have picked just about anyone to be Treasurer in that period of time, and they could have basically just kicked back a bit and waited for the rivers of gold to deliver the revenues, and then spend like there was no tomorrow.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">There are some really good facts about the biggest spending, biggest taxing government in Australia's history—and that was called 'Howard and Costello'.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">No-one questions that. There is no economist in this country or internationally who questions that.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Then a GFC came along, and so we had to make some tough choices in very tough conditions. That is when you get tested; that is when you measure things; that is when you start to look at what is happening to others besides you. We might live on an island, but we ain't one. We live on a small planet. Every single neighbour, every single OECD country, every single one of our trading partners has experienced some of the most difficult times in memory; in recorded times. They talked about it being the greatest depression since the 1930s. It was maybe even harder than that. What we did was to take some very tough decisions to make sure that we did not go down the path of Greece, Spain, Europe or, for that matter, the United States.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Over on the other side, you will only hear one mantra. This matter of public importance is not about a plan, fiscal rectitude or doing the right thing by the economy—it is not about any of that. It is the one plan that they have called on in this House every single day since the last election, which is, 'Let's blow this place up, let's run down the economy, let's oppose everything, no matter how important it is to the national economy, for opposition's sake.' They even opposed a stimulus plan, a plan to make sure that this economy kept going forward. That is there strategy: oppose everything; oppose every plan. Then they come in here and say that we do not have a plan.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">But there is something even worse. You do not have to dig too far. Just scratch the surface and the very thin cheap paint that is the veneer of the coalition—the Liberal Party and the National Party—and what do you reveal? One strategy; one plan. 'One-trick Tony' does not have resonance for nothing, because all they want is an election. Every day they pray for an election. If they can get one in quick enough, they just might win. Forget about trying to do something for the economy; forget Australians; forget business; forget about trade; forget about all of the things that we have to do to balance the budget.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">What we ought to be talking about this in place, and what we come in here to discuss, is what our plans are and what we have put into place. We have spent money where it needs and deserves to be spent. In our schools to provide school halls and science labs and more teachers for our students. We are making sure that when the young people in this country are competitive. And they are not competing against the boy or girl down the street, but with the boy or girl from Indonesia, from China, from Europe or from the United States.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">When they talk about us having no plan, have a look at the Asian century white paper, a plan that looks to the future and shows us where we need to be. When they talk about us having no plan, have a look at the <span style="font-style:italic;">Intergenerational Report </span>and the work that we have done in terms of meeting the challenges outlined in it. We have looked at the things that we will have to do in the future. Most people might be frightened by the fact that today there while in 1970 there were seven people in the workplace for every person aged over 65 today there are just five. But in 2050 there will be only 2.7 people in the workforce for every person aged over 65. That is scary enough on its own, so we ought to do something about it today. That is what we are doing. What is even more frightening is that there will be twice as many 65-year olds. And there will be four times as many 85-year olds.</span>
              </p>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">Everything that this government has done has been focused on delivering for the economy today while looking to the future. If those opposite want to talk about plans, bring in your plans. Tell the Australian people what you plan—aside from the usual thing that we hear, which is just Work Choices. The solution to everything, apparently, is to make it harder and harder for people to keep a job.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">Let me tell you a little bit about our economy and where we are at today. We have an economy 11 per cent larger in all terms than when we took government. The numbers show that there are better conditions today than when we took government at the end of the Howard-Costello era, an era in which it rained gold bars—an era in which you had to go out wearing one of those steel helmets so that a gold bar did not hit you in the head and you had to wear your trunks when you went outside because of the rivers of gold that flooded into this place.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We have had solid growth, with faster growth in this economy than in any other comparable advanced economy. We have low unemployment. Yes, unemployment is always too high—of course it is. But I tell you what: at 5.4 per cent, I would rather have this unemployment rate than any other in the world. We have had an exceptional jobs growth record, with 800,000 jobs created since Labor came back to office, despite the rest of the world shedding 27 million jobs. We have contained inflation. We have kept it within the normal target band. It is at 2.5 per cent through the year to September. That is important for families and for people trying to just get by.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">There is a low cash rate, 3.25 per cent. That is historically low. We have managed to bring down interest rates—which is important in this type of an economy—six times since we have been in office. Those on the other side took it up 10 times, while at the same time Howard and Costello were telling people that interest rates would be lower under a coalition government than at any other time in history and lower than under Labor. But that turns out not to be true. We have the figures at hand right now and everyone knows it. We have strong investment.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Apparently, this is a bad economy and a bad country. If you listen to these guys you would think that they want to flog the place off and move elsewhere. They just do not like Australia. The more I hear, the more I am starting to get the flavour of what they are on about: they just do not like Australia, they do not like this economy and they do not like the fact that Labor is doing a good job and are going to balance the budget. <span style="font-style:italic;">(Time expired)</span></span>

I will give the parliamentary secretary one bit of credit: he can certainly talk. He can make it up as he goes along but he knows enough in his heart of hearts that the one thing that he cannot say is, 'This government guarantees a surplus.' We did not hear the Assistant Treasurer say that he would guarantee a surplus, we have not heard the Treasurer guarantee a surplus and we cannot get the Prime Minister to guarantee a surplus. And that is because the big drift has begun. The MYEFO was released last Monday. It is not even two weeks old—it is eight days old—and already the big drift has started. They are starting to pave the way to once again walk away from a guarantee of a surplus. They cannot say today that they guarantee that surplus. But they have guaranteed it in the past; they have given numerous guarantees.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">The only guarantee from this government that the Australian people can rely on is that any guarantee is a guarantee that this government will break their word. Any guarantee is a guarantee that the position will be reversed. We have had surpluses guaranteed. We have budget outcomes guaranteed. We have had budget deficit projections guaranteed. But the one thing that we know about this government is that as soon as they say the word 'guarantee' you can be sure that they will walk away from it.</span>

                  </a>  It is normally at this point, Deputy Speaker Scott—and you are often on duty when this happens—when we get to the heart of Labor's fiscal credibility and to the detail of what they have actually done, that the minister is always on duty and, like a robotic lawnmower, he starts yapping. He is like a remote-control lawnmower over wet grass. It happens every time. I say to the parliament—and I do not like to reveal these secrets—that we find it mildly irritating, but his cabinet colleagues find it insufferable. I have discovered that this is not just a tactic for this parliament. This is an uncontrollable urge from the minister opposite to babble constantly, 24-hours a day. As I start recounting Labor's fiscal record, the babbling will start again, like it is remote controlled.</span>

This is a couple of years after the global financial crisis. This is after the last election. Let's have a look at what the solemn prediction was for the size of the budget deficit for the 2011-12 financial year, the financial year that ended just a few months ago: $12 billion. Six months later the budget was brought down: $22 billion. In December of last year: $37 billion. And we got the final budget outcome a few weeks ago: $44 billion.

                  </a>  We are told that the budget will be in surplus by $1.1 billion. So, from a Treasurer who solemnly promises a $12 billion deficit and delivers a $44 billion deficit, we get the idea that he can have the precision of the best marksman in the world, all of a sudden, and deliver this surplus. The Australian public never believed it. If the Treasurer was competing in an archery contest the only safe place to watch would be on TV. The Australian people have seen this time and time again.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">But we can go back right to the very first days of this government to see their form. I want to go back to the very first budget. The shadow Treasurer has rightly pointed out all of the fiddles and the manufacturing to try to produce this flimsy figure. He has been through the mining tax—that MYEFO document deliberately timed not to reflect the mining tax, because the amount collected was zero. As the shadow Treasurer has rightly pointed out this is the first tax we can think of that collects no revenue. The Henry review said that the lowest yielding tax in Australia was, I think, the queen bee levy. But, no, now we have the mining tax that collects zero. This is the pub with no beer. It is the steakhouse with no steak. The very day that that figure was coming in, the zero figure, the Mid<span style="&#xD;&#xA;    font-family:MS Mincho;&#xD;&#xA;  ">‑</span>Year Economic and Fiscal Outlook was released, so that it would not reflect that zero. That is why it was released. There are so many fiddles in all of the budget figures and the shadow Treasurer and the shadow minister for finance have outlined them in detail.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Not only does this government have form but from their very first days in office they have been intent on fiscal deceit—from their very first budget. The first budget brought down by the Treasurer, in 2008, invented a new term. I will quote. He was talking about a surplus he inherited back then from Peter Costello.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Small">It is a surplus built on substantial savings of $33 billion over four years, including $7 billion in 2008<span style="&#xD;&#xA;    font-family:MS Mincho;&#xD;&#xA;  ">‑</span>09 alone. </span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">After the budget was handed down, financial commentators and economists were interested to know that the term 'savings' had been redefined. Savings did not just mean expenditure reductions. It also meant tax rises. But it was just suddenly redefined by a Treasurer who began his first days with fiscal deceit and has continued to do so every day from them on.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">The next year, when the Treasurer took the budget into deficit, he delivered a budget speech that did not mention the size of the budget deficit. There was a budget deficit that was not in the budget speech. Think about what a budget is. At the end of the day it is a whole pack of books, but they all add up to one figure: a surplus or a deficit. And he could not mention it in the speech. From then on the deceit of this government has grown and grown.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">What we are seeing in this House now is another invention from this government. They will cover it with fiscal fiddles. If this government were ever able to produce a surplus, there would be more fudge in the figures than in Willy Wonka's entire chocolate factory. And the minister there reminds me of the TV kid. Remember that character? He also yabbered along constantly. He was the one with the painful parents and he yabbered on incessantly.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">

                <span class="HPS-Normal">And now they have started the crab walk away from their surplus commitment. Those opposite know in their heart of hearts that this Treasurer will never produce a surplus. He has produced only deficits; he will never produce a surplus. In the meantime, he will fiddle every figure he can in the budget. He will do all he can to try to maintain this falsehood. But you need only look at his record for the 2011-12 year—the year just gone. Over two years, 12 went to 22 to 37 to 44, and all of a sudden he says he is the most expert sniper in the world. <span style="font-style:italic;">(Time expired)</span></span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">This MPI will demonstrate to the Australian people why the member for North Sydney—the shadow Treasurer—should never be Treasurer. It also demonstrates—and the contribution of the member for Casey also demonstrates—that the opposition should never sit on the government benches. It just does not understand economics, the economy and how to manage it. The opposition is an economic disaster zone, and it has at no stage demonstrated any fiscal credibility.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">That is contrary to the government. The government has had some strong economic achievements, and the mid-year review shows that the Gillard government is on track to return the budget to surplus. I know it disappoints those in the opposition. They do not want the budget to return to surplus. But the fundamentals of the Australian economy are strong despite global turmoil. The opposition should be proud of the performance of our economy, but instead they like to talk it down, talk it down, talk it down. We have solid growth, low unemployment, strong investment and contained inflation—very strong economic indicators that I never hear opposition members talking about. It shows that our economy is one of the strongest economies in the world, and it is able to sustain and withstand all the economic pressures from overseas.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">Delivering a surplus gives the Reserve Bank maximum room to cut interest rates. When I talk about interest rates I think back to the times when the Howard-Costello government sat on the government benches. I remember interest rate increase one, two, three, four—right up to 10—and members of the Howard junta arguing that the Howard government would always keep interest rates lower than a Labor government would. Those on the other side are probably hanging their heads and trying to shuffle away from that, because there have been six interest rate decreases under the Labor government.</span>

                  </a>  'Have they acknowledged them?' the member for Moreton asks. Well, I never hear anything about that these days. And if anything is said about it, it is always put in a negative light: talk it down, talk it down, talk it down. A family with a mortgage of $300,000 is paying around $4,500 less a year, something I think benefits the families I represent in this parliament. And the responsible savings made by the government have led to the biggest increase in age pension and paid parental leave in history. My electorate is an older electorate, and I know that the pensioners I represent in this parliament live in trepidation of the Liberal Party—the opposition—gaining control of the government benches. They know that means they are going to have payments ripped away from them, just as the families that live in the Shortland electorate and other areas know that the opposition plans to destroy the Schoolkids Bonus. That will hurt 1.3 million families, and in the Shortland electorate 8,500 families will be punished if there is a Liberal coalition government sitting on the government benches. At the same time, they will not reinstate the education tax bonus, and they will slash $600 a year in extra family tax benefit payments from 1.5 million families in Australia and from 16,000 families in the Shortland electorate.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">A little bit of honesty here: the plan from the government is to continue strong economic growth; we will continue to step up to the plate in very tough economic times; and we will make the hard decisions that need to be made, whilst at the same time maintaining strong employment. Employment has been mentioned in this debate. We have an unemployment rate of 5.4 per cent, which is the envy of countries throughout the world. When I look at the MYEFO forecast for jobs, last year in the budget 500,000 jobs were created against a forecast of 175,000—performing above the forecast.</span>

He does not bother to get all the facts; he does not bother to let truth stand in the way of what he is about to say. The Australian people are really waking up to him. They are really beginning to understand that he yells and blusters and speaks loudly but he delivers nothing. He has no vision; he has no plan. He talks about the plan that the government has to reach a surplus. The MYEFO statement looks at apprenticeships and targets to areas of high need.

But what plan does the shadow Treasurer have for Australia?

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Longman</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">16:40</span>):  Last year, and again this year, I rose in this place to put a very simple question to the Treasurer. I wanted to know when the Treasurer would bring the budget back into surplus and when this federal Labor government would be able to pay off the massive debt that it has accumulated in just four short years.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">After the Treasurer used his time to call me a dole bludger, and whatever other personal insults that he could come up with to dodge answering the question, the Treasurer revealed that he did not have an answer for the Australian people. He could not say what this government's plans were to bring the budget back into surplus. Given that, in my lifetime, the Labor Party has never delivered a budget surplus in this place, it would seem to me that the Labor Party's addiction to wasteful spending and mismanagement is no way to manage our nation's finances.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">It did not take long for the Treasurer came back to his talking points. In the budget the Treasurer handed down in May he made an unequivocal promise to the Australian people: he promised that the government would deliver a budget surplus in 2012-13. His words were: 'This budget delivers a surplus this coming year, on time, as promised, and surpluses each year after that'. Well, based on past experience, with school-hall rip offs, Pink Batts and set-top boxes, we on this side of the House were a little sceptical that the Labor Party could deliver a budget surplus. Our suspicions have continued to grow with each new project blow-out and new promise adding to the Labor Party's $120-plus billion budget black hole, not to mention the numerous changes to the carbon tax—and, most remarkably of all, a tax that does not even raise revenue: the mining tax.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">But, despite our suspicions on this side of the House, we were prepared to wait and see what this Labor government came up with in its Mid-Year Economic and Fiscal Outlook. We were prepared to be surprised, but instead have been disappointed. The Treasurer has delivered exactly what we have come to expect from the Labor Party in the MYEFO. The Treasurer's adamant promises from last year, 'We'll be back in the black by 2012-13' mean little.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Last week we saw the release of MYEFO, and with it we saw a complete failure of the government to deliver an economic and fiscal plan to return the budget to surplus. The Treasurer revealed that this Labor government have no plan for the future, and it is clear that they are making up the rules as they go along, cooking the books to hide the true state of the budget. MYEFO revealed that the only certainty with this Labor government is more waste, more mismanagement, more debt and more taxes. If you too have wondered, like me, why the Labor government seemed to rush to deliver a MYEFO last week, you only had to wait a few days to hear the Treasurer announce to the Australian people that the mining tax that he and the Prime Minister personally negotiated had raised not one cent. Let me make this point very clear: the Treasurer told the Australian people in his budget update that he expected to collect $2 billion from the mining tax this financial year. And then a few days later we find out that this tax has raised not one cent.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">This Labor government is unique. Only this Labor government could introduce a tax that raises no money yet increases Australia's sovereign risk profile, adds a record level of red tape for business and still hangs as a threat over successful mining companies. This is the stuff of fiction. In <span style="font-style:italic;">Yes Minister</span>, we saw a hospital that did not have patients. Here in Canberra we have our very own version of this drama. We now have a tax that does not raise revenue. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">This Labor government had me a little confused, like so many Australians. I had to go back to my office and pick up a copy of the <span style="font-style:italic;">Macquarie Dictionary</span>, a dictionary that is often spoken about in this place, to try and find some answers. According to the <span style="font-style:italic;">Macquarie Dictionary</span>, a tax is a 'compulsory monetary contribution demanded by a government'. It would seem to me that the Treasurer has a bit of a dilemma. He can come clean with the Australian people and admit his complete inability to manage the nation's finances and resign in the most honourable way, or he can pick up the phone and give those pesky academic types at the <span style="font-style:italic;">Macquarie Dictionary</span> a hard time about their definition of a tax. Only this Labor government could introduce a tax that raises no money but increases Australia's sovereign risk and adds to the pile of red tape facing businesses. Only this Labor government could design a tax that not only fails to raise revenue but adds an additional $120 billion-plus to the government's great big budget black hole. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">When this Labor government was elected, it inherited a $20 billion surplus and $70 billion worth of net Commonwealth assets. Now we see that in 2011-12, under this Labor government, net debt reached a staggering $147 billion, and the government's own modelling indicates that this figure will remain virtually unchanged for years to come. The answer to this challenge is not new taxes. It is not more wasteful spending. I would like to take this opportunity to share with the House a quote from a pamphlet from 1916 that was passed on to me by a local small business owner:</span>

The answer is not to gouge private health insurance holders either. In a last ditch effort, the government is ripping $1.1 billion of out of private health insurance measures, with $700 million coming out of private health insurance rebates. The answer is not to lose control of our borders, at a cost of more than $1.2 billion this year alone.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">There are two bills being proposed at this time: the Appropriation (Implementation of the Report of the Expert Panel on Asylum Seekers) Bill (No. 1) 2012-2013 and the Appropriation (Implementation of the Report of the Expert Panel on Asylum Seekers) Bill (No. 2) 2012-2013. These bills seek an appropriation authority from parliament for the additional expenditure of money from the consolidated revenue fund. The funding sought in these appropriations is consistent with, and already budgeted for in, the Mid-Year Economic and Fiscal Outlook.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">These bills require passage to provide additional appropriation to the Department of Immigration and Citizenship. These bills address the increased costs of irregular maritime arrivals resulting from the higher rates of arrivals and the implementation of the recommendations of the Expert Panel on Asylum Seekers—the expert panel—including capital works and services for regional processing facilities on Nauru and Manus Island, Papua New Guinea. The total appropriation being sought through these two bills is $1,674,982,000.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Turning now to the Appropriation (Implementation of the Report of the Expert Panel on Asylum Seekers) Bill (No. 1) 2012-2013, the total appropriation being sought is a little over $1.4 billion. This includes $110.6 million for Houston report measures, including $92.043 million to increase the humanitarian program by an additional 6,250 places to 20,000 per annum from 2012-2013; $8.181 million to increase the family reunion stream of the permanent migration program by 4,000 places; and $10 million to fund capacity-building initiatives in regional countries. It also includes $1.296 billion to meet expenses arising from the management of higher levels of irregular maritime arrivals and the operational expenses associated with the implementation of the expert panel's recommendations to establish regional processing centres on Nauru and Manus Island. This includes a $186 million accrual from 2011-2012. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This is the only party that is committed to delivering a proper and sustainable regional solution through the implementation of the recommendations of the expert panel, which was led by Angus Houston. As I previously indicated, the funding sought in these appropriations is consistent with, and already budgeted for, in MYEFO. No-one should doubt the government's commitment to implementing the 22 recommendations of the expert panel to break the people smugglers' business model and to help stop people dying at sea. This suite of measures, as outlined in the panel's recommendations, is the only way we will begin to see a reduction in the rate of boat arrivals. That means, of course, immediate implementation of the regional processing on Nauru and Papua New Guinea, which we are doing swiftly and effectively. We already have almost 400 people on Nauru and transfers will begin shortly to Manus Island. Nauru will have a capacity of 1,500 beds. It currently has about 500 places. We expect to see 600 places in Papua New Guinea as work continues on those facilities.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">As I referred to earlier, the government has also increased Australia's humanitarian intake to 20,000, providing increased resettlement options for people in need from priority regions in the Middle East, Africa and Asia. Last week I announced the make-up of that intake, targeting those most in need, especially vulnerable people in camps around the world. We are providing opportunities for vulnerable and displaced people to pursue safer resettlement options in Australia. We are telling desperate people that there is a better way than taking a dangerous boat journey—a better way as part of an orderly humanitarian program. The messages here are that taking a dangerous boat journey will provide no advantage, that there is no visa awaiting people on arrival, no speedy outcome and no special treatment. This tells the lie to the people smugglers' spin. In the meantime the cost of processing and accommodating asylum seekers is expensive, as it always has been, but the only way to reduce these costs is to have fewer people arriving by boat. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">No-one should doubt our commitment to doing that, but it is something that we could do much more effectively with the implementation of the Malaysia arrangement. We know that those opposite so long stood in the way of offshore processing legislation, refusing to let the government implement its border protection policies, because they did not want the government to succeed. We know that the Malaysia agreement can indeed break the people smugglers' business model and it is time to allow it to be implemented. No-one can deny that the combination of regional processing on Nauru and Papua New Guinea, along with transfers to Malaysia, would stop the flow of boats and provide an ironclad deterrent. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">There is still some way to go before we see the real effect of the policies the government has been implementing, and people smugglers will continue to test our resolve. But there can also be no doubt that we are starting to see positive, if only early, results. To date the government has facilitated a number of voluntary removals to Sri Lanka, with more than 70 people choosing not to engage Australia's protection obligations and instead return home. More returns are expected—further proof that people smugglers only sell lies and make false promises about what awaits people in Australia.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This bill provides additional funding to the Department of Immigration and Citizenship for the requirements for departmental equity injections and requirements to create or acquire administered assets to discharge administered liabilities. The total appropriation being sought in Appropriation (Implementation of the Report of the Expert Panel on Asylum Seekers) Bill (No. 2) 2012-2013 is $267,980,000. The government will provide to the Department of Immigration and Citizenship $267,380,000 of administered assets and liabilities, funding in this bill for the Offshore Asylum Seeker Management program. This is to meet initial capital costs required to establish regional processing centres on Nauru and Manus Island, as recommended by the Expert Panel on Asylum Seekers. </span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I note that the re-establishment of offshore processing in these places has the support of the coalition. The government will also be providing the Department of Immigration and Citizenship with $600,000 of departmental equity injections, funding in this bill for the settlement services program. This is for the departmental costs associated with the implementation of the recommendation of the expert panel to increase humanitarian migration to 20,000 places. </span>

                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">These are vital elements that go to the implementation of a suite of measures that can break the people-smuggling trade and save lives at sea by preventing these dangerous boat journeys in the first place. We do want to remove the incentive for people to travel to Australia by boat, whether it is by providing more offshore refugee places, removing the special humanitarian program family reunion concessions for boat arrivals or transferring post-August 13 arrivals to Nauru and Manus Island.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The way in which this government has been implementing the expert panel's recommendations provides clear evidence of our determination to break the people smugglers' business model. This is only the beginning. Transfers continue to Nauru while Manus Island will shortly start receiving arrivals, and work is continuing on both islands to increase capacity. Of course, as we continue to implement more of the panel's recommendations, we will start to see a greater impact on reducing boat numbers. Should the opposition or the Greens party, for that matter, choose to stop hindering the government, they would support the Malaysia agreement—an agreement the expert panel acknowledged was the pathway to a truly regional and sustainable solution to irregular migration. I commend the bill to the House.</span>

                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Schedules 1, 2 and 3 of the bill amend the Banking Act 1959, the First Home Saver Accounts Act 2008 and the Life Insurance Act 1995. The changes reduce from seven years to three the period of inactivity before bank accounts and life insurance moneys are treated as unclaimed. Currently, authorised deposit taking institutions are required to transfer accounts to the Australian Securities and Investments Commission where there has not been a deposit or a withdrawal, other than bank fees, for seven years. There is a similar requirement for life insurers except that the seven-year period is from when an amount becomes payable, such as when a policy matures. To help reunite people with their unclaimed money, details of all unclaimed bank accounts and life insurance amounts are published on the ASIC website. People can reclaim these bank accounts and life insurance amounts at any time. However, currently no form of interest is paid when they are reclaimed. Under the amendments the inactive period will be shortened to three years and interest will be paid at a rate equivalent to consumer price index inflation from 1 July 2013. This will ensure that bank accounts and life insurance amounts reclaimed from ASIC maintain their real value—a very important amendment and a very good one for consumers.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Schedule 4 of this bill amends the Superannuation (Unclaimed Money and Lost Members) Act 1999 to change the circumstances in which small lost accounts and accounts of unidentifiable members are required to be transferred to the Commissioner of Taxation and to provide for the payment of CPI interest on unclaimed superannuation money. The first change relates to small lost accounts. The account balance threshold below which lost accounts are required to be transferred to the Australian Taxation Office will be increased from $200 to $2,000 where the account has been inactive for a period of five years or the member is uncontactable. The second change relates to the tiny proportion of superannuation accounts where the member is unidentifiable. These are accounts where the superannuation provider is satisfied that it will never be possible for the provider to pay an amount to the member—for example, where they are missing both the member's name and tax file number. The period of inactivity before which the accounts of unidentifiable members are required to be transferred to the ATO will also be reduced from five years to 12 months. These amounts represent only a tiny proportion of superannuation—in fact, less than 0.1 per cent.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Individuals can reclaim at any time superannuation accounts transferred to the ATO. However, no form of interest is currently paid when they are reclaimed. Under the new arrangements interest will accrue and be payable from 1 July 2013 on all superannuation accounts reclaimed from the ATO, further boosting an individual's retirement savings—again, a win for consumers. The ATO has a number of strategies in place to help reunite members with lost super accounts to help reduce the number of inactive and unnecessary accounts. ATO programs like SuperSeeker have helped to reunite about 1.9 million lost and unclaimed superannuation accounts worth $3.2 billion—that is $3.2 billion going back to ordinary people for their retirement savings. This was done with their owners during the 12 months to 30 June this year. This was the first time the amount of lost and unclaimed super has declined, after reaching a peak of almost $21 billion at 30 June 2011. By transferring more small lost accounts to the ATO and paying CPI interest, these accounts will not only be properly protected from being eroded from fees and charges but will also maintain their real value over time.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The Treasury estimates that, under the current rules, a 20-year-old with $1,000 in superannuation can unknowingly have their super savings eroded to just $418 after five years by a range of fees and deductions. Fees and insurance charges typically exceed average investment earnings, even for accounts with $2,000. For example, a 30-year-old with $2,000 can unknowingly have their super savings eroded to just $1,250 over the same five-year period. However, as a result of the new arrangements a 20-year-old with $1,000 currently inactive in super is expected to be able to claim $1,131 from the ATO after five years—a boost to their superannuation savings of around $700 compared with the current arrangements. This is a massive win for consumers and a proper way to deal with people's retirement savings. A 30-year-old with $2,000 is expected to be able to claim $2,263 from the ATO after five years—a boost to their superannuation savings of around $1,000 compared with the current arrangements.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">These are good and sensible changes that help reunite consumers with their lost bank accounts and superannuation accounts. This also maintains the value of those accounts into the future. The new arrangements will also help reduce the number of superannuation accounts that have unidentifiable members by reducing the period of time for which a superannuation fund can hold the account of an unidentifiable member. This will encourage funds to collect sufficient information to identify members during the period when contributions are being made.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Schedule 5 of this bill amends the Corporations Act 2001 and the Australian Securities and Investments Commission Act 2001 to streamline the processes around the administration and distribution of unclaimed moneys and properties under the Corporations Act.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Currently unclaimed property, including unclaimed money, is handled by the regulator, by ASIC, on behalf of the Commonwealth and deposited into the Companies and Unclaimed Monies Special Account on receipt, CUMSA. Under the amendments, unclaimed property will be recognised directly in the Commonwealth consolidated revenue fund upon receipt by ASIC. Owners of unclaimed property will be able to lodge claims for unclaimed property at any time, the same as with any accounts—so nothing there changes. In addition, owners of unclaimed property will for the first time be paid an interest component equal to CPI inflation for amounts reclaimed after 1 July 2013.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The government was elected in 2007 with a commitment to bring fairness, balance, flexibility and simplicity to the Australian workplace relations system. Prior to the 2007 election, Labor released two detailed policies on workplace relations, including a clear plan about how we would move from Work Choices to Fair Work. The government have delivered on our commitments. Under the Fair Work Act and the government's economic policies, 16,000 enterprise agreements covering more than 2.2 million Australian employees have been approved. Around seven million Australians are currently protected from unfair dismissal, and more than 800,000 jobs have been created since this government was first elected at the end of 2007.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">There have also been landmark achievements in particular sectors. The historic equal remuneration decision for workers in the social and community services, the SAC sector, awarded wage increases of between 23 and 45 per cent to social and community service workers in recognition of the fact that their work had been traditionally undervalued due to the predominantly female work force. We now have consistent protections for TCF workers across the national workplace relations system, and we have now implemented a road safety remuneration system to make sure there are real protections for truck drivers across Australia who would otherwise face economic pressures to drive dangerously long hours that put all Australian road users at risk.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The government has also delivered on its commitment to undertake a review of our Fair Work Act within two years of its full implementation. On 22 December 2011 I announced an independent panel of three experts to review the fair work legislation. The terms of reference for the review were wide ranging, encompassing an assessment as to whether the legislation was meeting its objectives and any areas for improvement. The consultative approach the government adopted during the development of the Fair Work Act was mirrored by the review panel, which issued a discussion paper, received over 250 written submissions and held many meetings and round tables with a large range of stakeholders.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The panel's report was approved by the Office of Best Practice Regulation. The panel concluded that the Fair Work Act is working well and is meeting its objectives, and the economic outcomes under the Fair Work Act have been favourable to Australia's continuing prosperity. The panel made 53 recommendations to government. Since receiving the panel's report I have been discussing the recommendations with employers and employer organisations, unions, Fair Work Australia and the Fair Work Ombudsman as well as state and territory governments. I have also held two round table discussions with small business representatives to discuss the panel's report and the government's proposed response as well as other workplace relations matters that are important to small business, like compliance, advice and superannuation. It has become obvious from these consultations that there is broad support for around a third of the recommendations. These recommendations are reflected in the bill I am introducing today. I will continue to work with stakeholders on the remaining recommendations, with a view to introducing further legislation in the new year.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The key elements of the Fair Work Amendment Bill include four main elements: one, changes to the unfair dismissal provisions to improve the integrity of the application and hearing process and to align the time frames for making unfair dismissal claims and general protections dismissal claims at 21 days; two, changes to the structure and operation of Fair Work Australia as recommended by the review panel and proposed by the president of Fair Work Australia; three, a process for determining the most suitable funds to be listed as default funds and modern awards that meet the principles in the model outlined, by and large, by the Productivity Commission in a way which is workable for employers and employees; and, four, other technical and clarifying amendments recommended by the review panel for which there is broad agreement amongst stakeholders.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I  want to place on record my thanks to the members of the National Workplace Relations Consultative Council, who have endorsed the government's broad approach in responding to the review, and to the NWRCC members who have assisted the Department of Education, Employment and Workplace Relations and Treasury in reviewing this bill and providing technical feedback.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Turning to the first of the key changes around unfair dismissal, under the Fair Work Act around seven million Australians are protected from unfair dismissal, and we are proud of that fact in the government. We are proud that the review panel did not recommend wholesale changes to the unfair dismissal regime, because it reflects a balance between the interests of employees and the interests of employers. We are proud that small businesses have told us that the Small Business Fair Dismissal Code is working for them. The proceedings before Fair Work Australia are improving, and the Fair Work Ombudsman is working with them on information and compliance. On this basis, we are waiting for the opposition to confirm that they will not wind back unfair dismissal protections for hardworking Australians and their families to anything resembling what they implemented when last in office.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">However, this bill does amend the unfair dismissals and general protections provisions, as recommended by the panel review. The amendments are to ensure the right of an employee to bring an unfair dismissal claim is better balanced against the right of an employee to ensure that they are only required to respond to applications that are genuine and to ensure that Fair Work Australia has the power to deal with unreasonable conduct in relation to a claim, including dismissing an application and additional powers to award costs in certain circumstances. In relation to improving applications, the government has announced that the independent review panel recommendation that additional information should be required to be provided in applications about the circumstance of the dismissal is supported, and we will work with Fair Work Australia to implement that recommendation.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This bill will also implement the independent review panel's recommendation that the time frames for lodging an unfair dismissal claim and a general protections claim involving a dismissal should be aligned at 21 days. This will ensure that dismissed employees make the right claim in the right jurisdiction, this will ensure that employees have an appropriate time frame to seek advice about a dismissal so they can make this choice in an informed way and this will ensure that employers will respond to one claim in respect of a dismissal—not an unfair dismissal claim and later a general protections claim.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The panel's recommendations relating to costs orders where a party to an unfair dismissal matter has caused another party to incur costs by an unreasonable act or omission are also reflected in this bill. This recommendation reflects the panel's concerns that a few, a very few, unscrupulous lawyers and agents may be encouraging dismissed employees to pursue unfair dismissal claims without merit on a no-win no-fee basis. This government believes in protecting workers from unfair dismissal but also acknowledges that from time to time some people will pursue unreasonable claims. In these circumstances, there is a need to strike a balance. These amendments will enable costs orders to be made against a person or their legal representative when they have unreasonably pursued a claim but, importantly, will not stop a party with a genuine claim from robustly pursuing it through the avenues available to them. Similarly, the bill will allow applications to be dismissed in certain circumstances, such as when the applicant, without any reasonable explanation or excuse, has failed to attend a hearing or comply with an order made by the commission or has failed to discontinue an application after a settlement agreement has been concluded.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Let me make it absolutely clear: these amendments are intended to provide cost consequences for applications without merit and for actions taken during proceedings that are unreasonable; however, they will still ensure that employees with a genuine claim can fully pursue a remedy for unfair dismissal. This is balanced and fair. During my consultations, small business representatives have been supportive of these recommendations. My feedback from employers is that both small businesses and larger businesses believe they will benefit from these amendments in terms of reducing vexatious or speculative claims.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The second part of this bill is about technical amendments. The bill will implement several technical and clarifying recommendations made by the review panel, including that, in line with a recent decision of the full bench of Fair Work Australia, opt-out clauses cannot be included in agreements, and that under this government statutory agreements cannot be made with a single employee. There are also technical amendments implementing the panel's recommendations in relation to the notification requirements for scope orders and what may be included in a notice of representative rights to employees. The bill provides clarity around how protected action ballots can be conducted, while preserving the existing strict requirements and processes that must be satisfied before protected industrial action can be taken. It confirms that an official from one union cannot act as a bargaining agent for an employee where that union does not have coverage. And it implements the panel's recommendations to vary modern awards.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The third set of changes concern Fair Work Australia. The government is proposing a number of changes to the structure and operation of Fair Work Australia. A number of these changes were recommended by the review panel and further changes were proposed by the President of Fair Work Australia and considered by the members of the NWRCC. First, the government will give effect to the panel's recommendation to change the name of Fair Work Australia. The new name will be the Fair Work Commission. There has been much debate about the appropriate name for the national workplace relations tribunal in recent times. The government considers 'Fair Work Commission' accurately reflects the functions of this body and is consistent with the establishment and role of the commission within the fair work system. In particular, the commission takes its functions and powers from the terms of the Fair Work Act.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The bill includes administrative changes recommended by the review panel such as allowing any presidential member to make stay orders, allowing acting commissioners to be appointed if required and providing for the Governor-General to appoint the general manager on the nomination of the president. This change brings the procedure for appointing the general manager into line with the appointment of a registrar of the Federal Court.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The bill also includes additional measures relating to the internal structure of the Fair Work Commission that the government considers will improve the operation and the integrity of the body. The measures include creating two statutory positions of vice-president. This will assist in attracting senior practitioners to the commission, a highly desirable outcome given the significance of the matters that the commission deals with, and will ensure assistance can be provided to the president in managing the work of the commission as required.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The bill also contains a clear and transparent process for handling complaints against members of the commission. It also contains amendments to better deal with the disclosure of conflicts of interest. There are a number of procedural amendments relating to the handling of matters before Fair Work Australia such as allowing certain matters to be referred to a full bench when it is in the public interest to do so. These reflect terms used in previous workplace legislation and are designed to ensure that the commission can be responsive to the interests of the parties and respond effectively and efficiently to certain matters when required.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">A further part of this bill concerns default superannuation funds and modern awards. As I announced on 15 October this year, this bill will include measures reflecting the government's response to the Productivity Commission's inquiry into default superannuation funds in modern awards. That inquiry delivers on the government's 2010 election commitment to review this important issue, and I thank the Productivity Commission on behalf of the government for their comprehensive engagement with this very important subject.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The government wants to improve the operation of the superannuation system to boost the retirement incomes of Australians into the future. Superannuation is a critical part of the industrial, economic and social safety net of our country. It provides a living wage for Australians in their retirement, allowing Australians to retire in comfort and with dignity. The default fund system is particularly important because it is relied upon by all employees who do not make active choices over their superannuation fund and are paid under an award. This is estimated to be a large proportion of all Australia employees. As noted in the Productivity Commission's report:</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">Over the eight years to 2011, default funds … averaged an after-tax rate of return of 6.4 per cent, compared with 5.5 per cent for non-default funds.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Notwithstanding this remarkable outcome, the government agrees with the Productivity Commission's recommendation that there should be increased transparency and contestability in the process of determining which funds should be listed as default funds in modern awards. The government also agrees with the Productivity Commission's view that the overarching consideration in choosing superannuation funds as default funds in modern awards should be the best interests of the employees whose hard-earned wages will be contributed to that fund.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We agree with the Productivity Commissioner, that the review should be conducted in an open and transparent way against clear and objective criteria. We agree that the process should be open to all funds with a generic MySuper product and that the analysis of the funds against a statutory criteria should be conducted by an expert panel within the Fair Work Commission, comprising experts with experience in superannuation, finance and investment management, as well as Fair Work Commission members.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The bill I introduce today includes measures to implement all of these recommendations as part of a new system for the selection of default funds in modern awards. Under the provisions outlined in this bill, all funds with a generic MySuper product will be able to apply to the Fair Work Commission for selection as a default fund on an equal basis, which will bring greater contestability to the system. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We will create an expert panel within the Fair Work Commission to assess funds on the basis of clear and objective legislative criteria. The panel will be made up of part-time members with suitable experience in superannuation, finance or investment management, as well as members of the Fair Work Commission. The government proposes the expert panel would also subsume the existing minimum wage panel. This will provide a broader pool of qualified experts to assist the work of the Fair Work Commission while ensuring that experts with appropriate expertise are used for particular functions. The criteria against which funds will be assessed are largely those proposed by the Productivity Commission. The expert panel will consider the applications in any submissions in an open and transparent process. The panel will determine which funds meet the criteria and will publish a list of funds that do so.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">However, we acknowledge that awards must be simple and accessible for those who use them every day. It is not simple for an employer to choose a fund from a large generic list of funds with no indication about whether a particular fund is more suited to their industry or workforce than another. Employees will also want reassurance that default funds used for their contributions most appropriately reflect their particular characteristics and needs as workers in a particular industry. That is why the government has decided that a full bench of the commission will determine which particular funds from the expert panel's list are best suited to each modern award.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The best interests of employees covered by each particular award will still be the overriding consideration. The full bench will also do this task in an open and transparent way. The government proposes that each modern award could include at least two, but no more than 10, default funds, unless the commission is satisfied there are particular circumstances relating to a range of occupations covered by the award to warrant the inclusion of more than 10 funds. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The government has departed from the Productivity Commission's recommendations in this respect to ensure that each modern award remains simple, relevant and workable for the employers and employees in each particular industry each award covers. The process will occur every four years, in line with the four-year review of modern awards commencing in 2014. The government has adopted this approach as it provides the greatest benefits to Australian workers for the long term. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This approach will ensure that default funds listed in modern awards are the best performing MySuper funds, and modern awards continue to be simple and stable documents that best meet the needs of employers and employees covered by them. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">In conclusion, this bill represents another important example of the government's ongoing commitment to provide a balanced and effective workplace relations system and a superannuation system that operates to maximise the retirement incomes of Australian workers. The bill follows extensive consultation on policy questions and technical detail, with many stakeholders, in particular members of the superannuation industry and members of the National Workplace Relations Consultative Council and their technical advisers through the committee on industrial legislation. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">However, this is not the last step. I am committed to continuing to work with all stakeholders on making appropriate amendments to the Fair Work Act where there is a clear policy justification and where they reflect the government's clear policy frameworks. I and the government retain an open mind on all remaining recommendations from the Fair Work Act Review Panel and none of them has been ruled in or out. I note the opposition have said they support the overwhelming majority of the panel's recommendations. Given this bill reflects the non-contentious aspects of the panel's recommendations, including measures to improve the operations of Fair Work Australia and delivers an improved process for choosing default funds, default superannuation funds and modern awards I trust the opposition will support the bill and assist its passage through the parliament. I commend the bill to the House. </span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">
                  <a href="DZU" type="MemberSpeech">
                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Ms KATE ELLIS</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Adelaide</span>—<span class="HPS-MinisterialTitles">Minister for Employment Participation and Minister for Early Childhood and Childcare</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">17:26</span>):  by leave—The Gillard government believes that no matter what your circumstances everybody who has the capacity to work should be able to enjoy the dignity of work. We believe Australians with disability deserve access to the very best employment services that we can deliver. We have made it clear that we are a government that is prepared to make the big reforms to ensure that Australians with a disability get a fair go and get better services—like introducing the country's first national disability insurance scheme. And, consistent with our commitment to better services and more choice, today I announce the results of the Australian government's tender for the support services to assist people with disability to get work. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">This follows big changes to disability employment services in 2010, when we removed caps on services so that every eligible jobseeker with a disability could benefit from assistance in finding and keeping work and not be forced to sit on waiting lists. In 2012-13 we also allocated a record $3.2 billion over four years to meet demand for disability employment services. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Today's tender announcements are the next step in ensuring that our record $3.2 billion investment is squarely focused on delivering the best possible employment outcomes for jobseekers. Some organisations have been receiving grants for employment services for over 20 years running, never having to demonstrate that they are the best possible provider and never having to ensure that local jobseekers are getting the most effective support.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">In that time, government has never undertaken an comprehensive, competitive process to ensure that the best available providers are delivering services. Jobseekers with a disability deserve better than that. When we took the decision to open these services to tender it was a decision made with a focus on people with a disability and a determination to work with the best available providers to deliver improved outcomes. We know a competitive tender process is necessary, because we could be doing better. The OECD currently ranks Australia 21 out of 29 countries for employment participation for people with a disability. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Falling behind worlds'-best-practice not only has a significant personal cost, but is also a missed opportunity for Australian business and our economy. If we catch-up to the average of the eight best performing countries, it will add $50 billion to our economy by 2050. In fact, the transition to an open and transparent tender is arguably the biggest reform in the disability employment sector for decades. It means that Australians with disability will now have access to a higher standard of employment support services in a more locations across Australia. It took a Labor government to take on this ambitious reform.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">This tender has been conducted in an open, fair and transparent manner. The selection criteria were set after comprehensive consultation and input from the sector and then judged in a fair and appropriate manner, including external probity oversight and a twelve-stage check. It was vitally important that this process was handled by-the-book and was independent.  Through the tender process, we provided training to assist organisations, along with a practice tender facility which provided organisations with the opportunity to ask questions about the process.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We want to make sure our disability services system is a robust system that offers the best possible results for people with a disability. We want to reward providers which are getting Australians good jobs, and helping them keep them.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Bullet">The results announced today include:</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Bullet" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Bullet">Expanding services to more locations than ever before, with the number of sites increasing by almost 50 per cent, from 1,145 to 1,654.</span>
              </p>

              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Bullet" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Bullet">Expanding 26 four and five-star providers to provide better quality services to more people with a disability.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Bullet" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Bullet">Providing jobseekers with a disability with greater choice, better services and options in more locations than ever before.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Bullet" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Bullet">Establishing new types of specialist services that focus not only on disability type, but on the needs of youth, homeless people and people from culturally and linguistically diverse backgrounds, for example.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We are doing this because our government has a proven commitment to supporting Australians with a disability. We are also doing it because there is growing evidence that having a job not only provides financial independence and a better standard of living, but also improved physical and mental health.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Since introducing the Disability Employment Services program on 1 March 2010, the Australian government has worked with industry to help place almost 136,000 participants with a disability into employment. It is a program that is now geared to get even better results. I can assure people that we will work with the sector and jobseekers to phase in the new arrangements. Each participant that will need to change provider will be contacted, and a personalised plan put in place for their transition. Throughout this process, links with employers, trainers and other services will be maintained. We know this is important, and we know that for many people this is not simple. That is why the transition process will commence in November this year and continue until 4 March 2013. Wherever possible, jobseekers moving provider will be given a choice. And those with higher needs will meet face-to-face with their existing provider and new provider before the transfer occurs.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I recognise that this is a challenging time for some in the sector. While some organisations chose not to tender because their focus does not lie in employment services or because they have chosen to be part of a group of organisations providing these services, there will be others who no longer deliver this program. Through our transition support package, we will work closely with individual organisations to ensure that they focus on their strengths and can build on the excellent work many of these community organisations deliver both in the employment space, and in many other important areas. We will be having further discussions with these organisations about how we can support their transition, particularly those in the community and not-for-profit sector.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We are also working closely with peak industry groups in the employment services sector to put in place a business adjustment tool, developed by KPMG. This is focused on positioning organisations for the future, and helping them to build on their strengths. We have worked to establish a disability employment jobs board to link new providers with skilled and experienced staff in their area. It is also why we have provided a range of training services to staff in disability employment services—to ensure people have the opportunity to ensure their skills and knowledge are up-to-date. We have learnt from similar tender processes in the past, and I am very confident that there will be many jobs and opportunities as we open more services in more locations than ever before.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Putting the Employment Support Service out to tender was the most open and transparent way to ensure the government and the public can have confidence that the best possible providers are delivering the most effective services to people with disability and their employers. It was a change that aligned with what disability advocates have been saying. For instance, the Australian Rehabilitation Providers Association lent their support, stating that:</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Small">The Federal Government should be congratulated for making the right call on this important policy issue. Australians with a disability and Australia as a whole will be far better off in the long-term as a result of this decision.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">It was a bold decision, and one that was backed by organisations representing people with a disability. Because ultimately, this will also mean better quality services and more choice for jobseekers with a disability. This change is about aiming high. And it is about backing Australians with a disability to participate in the workforce and enjoy the rewards, the dignity and the challenges of work.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">
                  <a href="00AMN" type="MemberSpeech">
                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Ms LEY</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Farrer</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">17:36</span>):  I rise to speak in response to the minister's statement on the tender outcomes of the Disability Employment Services—Employment Support Service, and I thank the minister for her statement and the information she has provided to me and my office about this process today. Like the government, the coalition believes that everyone who can work should work. Employment provides people with a sense of self-worth and, for many, grants them an independence they may not have previously experienced. Disability Employment Services have a crucial role to play in fostering the social inclusion of many Australians who have a disability. By assisting people into employment, we are helping them to engage more fully with the society around them.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The former coalition government made some important changes to disability employment. The open employment services program transferred from the portfolio of the Department of Families and Community Services, or FaCS, as it was then, to the Department of Employment and Workplace Relations, DEWR, in November 2004. In 2005, we replaced case based funding with a fee-for-service model. We also saw the introduction of an uncapped stream for some Disability Employment Network, otherwise known as DEN, participants, and major changes to the delivery of vocational rehabilitation services. These have all been important measures in developing Disability Employment Services and boosting employment for people with disabilities.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">But under this Labor government we seem to be on a backward trajectory. Indeed, I share the minister's concern that the OECD currently ranks Australia 21 out of 29 countries for employment participation for people with a disability. However, I think the minister needs to accept that this is a responsibility for the government, well and truly, and it rests on their shoulders. They have had the running on this for almost five years now.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">So, yes, improvements are needed, but a large portion of the blame should also be directed at the mass overload of administration and compliance required of providers. Remember: for every minute that you are complying with departmental contractual liabilities and associated requirements, you are not doing the job that you want to do, that you are trained for, and that, ironically, the government has contracted you to do, which is to work, face to face, nearly always, with people with a disability.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Serious measures to reduce red tape is a prime example of where we believe this government has fallen down. Across the board in employment services, providers are spending the majority of their time satisfying DEEWR compliance activities instead of focusing on the job seeker. This is time that could be far better spent with that job seeker, helping address their barriers to employment and helping them get the skills they need to do the job they want, or in business development. If we really want to engender an employment services model that provides flexibility and enables providers to take innovative approaches towards assisting people with disabilities into the workforce, then we need to do away with some of this red tape. Providers should not be weighed down with administration that does nothing to benefit the quality of the service provided to job seekers or, even worse, detracts from the time they can spend directly assisting someone into work—and that is not just in the office with the job seeker in front of the case worker. It is out in the workplace environment. It is driving to wherever the activity is taking place. It is calling them in the morning to make sure they are going to get up and go to work. It is dealing with the discussions that they have with their bosses. It is encouraging their employers not to let them go but to give them another chance. There is so much practical, physical, real work associated with this. I really get depressed and upset when I hear from services that tell me that their compliance burden is sometimes almost a third of their total workload.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We also need a sensible and fair performance management framework, and a tendering process that is equitable and transparent. Under this Labor government, the tendering arrangements for employment services were thrown into disarray with the initial tender for Job Services Australia. We saw concerns regarding breaches of probity from the then minister's office, with email communications between a provider and the minister's chief of staff, and an entire sector thrown into disarray with the decision to tender 100 per cent of the business. By tendering approximately 80 per cent of the business for Disability Employment Services, we do run a very real risk of additional chaos within the sector.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">History shows us that every new employment services contract takes months to revert to previous levels of employment placements and outcomes. Disruption in the disability employment sector can cause significant disruption to the servicing of a job seeker who has to transfer providers as a result of a negative tender outcome. I welcome the minister's commitment to the management of this transition process, both with the services and with the job seeker. I think that is very important. And I appreciate that that will be done.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">This is one of the reasons why, in the Senate committee inquiry into the administration and purchasing of disability employment services in Australia, we recommended that future contracts be extended from three years to five years. Not only is this a practical measure to ensure greater consistency for the job seekers but also it gives greater business certainty. Businesses are in a position to enter into five-year rental contracts. They can maintain relationships with local employers, and their staff have greater job security. There is also a further benefit to the Commonwealth by reducing pressure on existing resources every time a contract is put out to tender.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I do believe that the probity processes have improved, but I think that the government still persists in failing to hear the concerns of industry adequately. Many DES providers queried the decision to tender all business where providers were three star and below. I understand that, prior to this, three stars were considered the performance level to which providers should aspire, as a minimum satisfactory performance.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I think there is also room for government to do more to promote the employment of people into purposeful jobs. There is a tendency to place people with disabilities into jobs doing night-fill at supermarkets or trolley collection, yet many of these people have capacity for more hours or alternative jobs that offer career progression, and we need an employment services model that assists this process. Too often, we hear of providers feeling forced to move people into jobs that they otherwise would not, to keep them in jobs for a period of time that they otherwise would not, and to have their eye continually on the star ratings. I know that there has to be some measure of quality, but wherever the departmental contractual requirements make you, as a provider, do something that you otherwise would not do in the interests of your job seekers, then somewhere, somehow, the system has failed.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Finally, I will pay tribute to the sector, to its businesses and its workforce, for the heart and the soul and the strength that they put into the satisfying but often exhausting work that they do. Following the results of this tender process—and the opposition has just heard about it today, so we make no comment on who has been successful and who has been unsuccessful; that will come—there will be enormous disappointments. There will be frustrations. There will be a feeling of not being valued. And there will be that huge transition process not just for the workforce but for the job seekers.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">I do hope that the government has got this right. I do hope that this costly, lengthy and, in many cases, very difficult and challenging process that providers have got to go through in order to tender, to prove that they are the best, is actually going to be worth it in the end. And I do, as I said, want very much to thank the people who work with job seekers every day.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">There comes to mind one job seeker I met recently whose job was to clean a childcare centre. The centre called the employee in the morning and she said she was not going to make it in, so the entire staff of the Disability Employment Service rushed to the childcare service, cleaned the dirty nappies, emptied the bins and got it spotless for the day's work to begin—over and above, obviously, what they would be required to do, but such was their commitment. We, in this parliament, all appreciate and understand what they do, and we in the opposition reserve our judgement on the outcome of this tender process.</span>

                    </a>  Last night the Senate passed a number of amendments to the Defence Trade Controls Bill 2011 which the Senate has passed back to the House for concurrence via this message. As we have seen, there are 27 amendments to the bill. Of these, 24 are government amendments, two were moved by the Australian Greens and passed with government support, and one was moved by the opposition.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The government supports the 26 amendments which it supported in the Senate and opposes amendment (9) for reasons which I will outline subsequently. The bill was debated and passed, together with the Customs Amendment (Military End-Use) Bill 2011, which has also been amended by the Senate. The government also supports this amendment and will deal with that bill subsequently.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The Australia-US Defence Trade Cooperation Treaty was signed in September 2007. The treaty will improve two-way trade between Australia and the US in Defence goods, services and technology by eliminating the need for export licences for members of an approved community. The bill also introduces strengthened export control measures by introducing protections on the intangible transfer overseas of sensitive technology on the Defence and Strategic Goods List, the DSGL, such as supply by electronic means as well as controls on brokering the supply of listed sensitive Defence goods and technology. This will eliminate identified gaps in Australia's export controls system, align Australia with accepted international best practice and support international efforts to prevent proliferation of sensitive technology.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">In September 2008, the Joint Standing Committee on Treaties recommended that binding treaty action be taken. In September 2010, the US Senate recommended that the treaty be ratified. Defence commenced consultations on the proposed legislation with public information events at major cities around Australia in late 2010. Defence consulted with stakeholders, including the university sector, as early as May 2011 before a draft bill was released for public consultation in July 2011. Industry provided detailed comments, including through the Defence industry advisory panel, chaired by Mr Ken Peacock.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The Defence Trade Controls Bill was passed by the House in November last year. On 10 November last year the bill was referred to the Senate Scrutiny of Bills Committee and the Senate Standing Committee on Foreign Affairs, Defence and Trade for further consideration. The preliminary report of the Senate Standing Committee on Foreign Affairs, Defence and Trade, tabled in the Senate on 15 August this year, recognised the importance of the legislation and generally supported the intention of the bill. The committee recommended Defence conduct further consultations with the university and research sectors on the impact of controls on intangible transfers.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">At the time, I thanked the committee for identifying areas where the bill could be improved by further consultation. Further consultations were necessary to ensure the bill did not include any unintended consequences that might impact adversely on the university and research sectors. I asked Mr Peacock and the Chief Defence Scientist, Dr Alex Zelinsky, to conduct those further consultations.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">In mid-September I wrote to the committee outlining the proposals put forward by Mr Peacock and Dr Zelinsky and indicated in-principle support by the government. The government also supported the round table process chaired by the Chief Scientist, Professor Ian Chubb, the former Vice-Chancellor of the Australian National University.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The proposals put forward by Mr Peacock and Dr Zelinsky were considered by the Chief Scientist's round table process and, as agreed by participants in the round table process, have been into the bill as government amendments. The Chief Scientist made an important contribution, as did representatives of the university and research sectors who worked very constructively with him. While some individual participants maintained specific concerns, the round table process concluded on 21 September this year with an agreed way forward on a range of amendments to the bill. The committee—Mr Peacock, the Chief Defence Scientist, the Chief Scientist and the university and research sector—made significant recommendations which ensured an outcome that will protect our national security interest while responding to university and research sector concerns.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">On 10 October, the government circulated proposed amendments to the legislation which reflected the agreed outcomes of the Chief Scientist's round table. The Senate last night voted in support of all these amendments as well as additional amendments put forward by the other parties in the Senate, as I have described. The government has taken up all of the recommendations put forward by Mr Peacock and by the Chief Scientist. The government also supported additional amendments put forward by other parties in the Senate. These amendments set a minimum time frame of two years for the steering group, put the terms of reference for the steering group into the legislation, name the Chief Scientist as the chair of the steering group and task the steering group to advise ministers on whether Australia's export control arrangements are not more restrictive than US regulations on university activities. <span style="font-style:italic;">(Extension of time granted)</span></span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The government is not able to support one amendment passed by the Senate last night which, in the government's view, undermines the intent of the legislation and would significantly weaken efforts to strengthen Australia's export controls. Amendment (9) relates to a proposed exemption for the outcomes of fundamental research. This does not reflect the agreed way forward of the Chief Scientist's round table. The amendment would effectively exempt from the bill anyone who claims to be conducting fundamental research. This would mean a far broader effect than that caused by the US exception for fundamental research, which only applies to research outputs. Research inputs are subject to US export controls; there is no US exception that allows controlled technology to be exported from the US for fundamental research without US government authorisation.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">For these reasons the government opposes amendment (9) and seeks the support of the House to disagree to amendment (9).</span>

                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Fadden</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">17:54</span>):  To assist the House, I will put some brief comments to indicate why the coalition will be supporting the minister in his opposition to amendment (9).</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">On the subject of history: it is important to note that Prime Minister Howard signed the treaty between the government of Australia and the government of the United States of America concerning defence trade cooperation in September 2007 and that the Rudd government signed off on the subsequent implementation arrangements on 14 March 2008. Furthermore, the US Congress passed implementing legislation in September 2008, and the treaty received ratification consent by the US Senate on 29 September 2010. For two years they have been waiting for us to reach a point of decision.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This bill creates provisions for the establishment and management of the Australian defence industry in exporting goods and services to the US defence industry. Currently, Australian companies which need access to defence items or technology from the United States must seek an export licence from the US Department of State in accordance with the International Traffic in Arms Regulations: ITARS. The treaty removes the requirement for these licences to be obtained. The existing control regime has a focus on the export of physical goods, but the growth of technology and the provision of services over the intranet or through brokers is currently not being captured.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We firmly believe that there was insufficient consultation on this bill and on the resulting regulations—especially with the university sector, which will bear the full brunt of the legislation. The reaction has been mixed. Many concerns have been raised over the role of the US Department of State in approving Australian companies or individuals as trusted members of the Australian community. This process, in gaining such approval, is seen in some quarters as cumbersome, costly and time-consuming. Coupled with these concerns is the lack of confidence within the defence industry in the Australian defence controls office in making consistent decisions on what strategic goods can or cannot be exported. What is being proposed by the government remains unacceptable to the university sector, for reasons that have been made clear in submissions by Universities Australia and the University of Sydney.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">There continues to be a fundamental difference of opinion between Defence and the sector about the scope of export controls in the US pertaining to research conducted in universities. The outcomes of the Chief Scientist's round table process are not sufficient because they do not guarantee that the university sector's key concerns about the scope of research activities to be controlled by the bill will be addressed. The government is asking the Senate, the Australian public research community and the House to accept its assurances that the government amendments will address unintended or unforseen consequences arising from the proposed trials. We are a little short of accepting the government's assurances on many issues. Given the complexity of the bill and the clear potential for negative impact on the public good—and, in particular, on the research sector—the Senate committee report reviewed the reforms proposed by the government and acknowledged that they were far from ideal. Both Universities Australia and the University of Sydney have suggested that the critical issue of Defence's controls of intangible supplies pertaining to university research, compared with the arrangements currently in place in the US, remain unresolved. At the very least we urge the government to ensure that Australia's system for the control of intangible supplies is no broader or more stringent in scope than the equivalent arrangements currently in place in the US and that they are in accord with the legal advice from White &amp; Case.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We introduced amendments in the Senate to provide for the exclusion of research education information to be published in the public domain. The government has indicated to us in the strongest possible terms that our amendments will render the bill ineffective. The government's reasoning on this has been largely unconvincing; however, there is a time when it is necessary to err on the side of caution. This is one such time, given the serious subject matter encompassed by this bill and given the fact that the minister knows that I take bipartisan support on military operations and military engagement seriously. That bipartisanship means that I err on the side of caution if sufficient reasons have been raised that there could be an issue. We have been assured that the two-year transition period—it is in the Greens amendment, to their credit—which has been agreed to will give everyone breathing space with no penalties to be provided. The transitional period which the government has agreed to will enable all stakeholders to acquire an understanding of the bill's practical application. If it is proven to be unsatisfactory in any aspect, the bill can be amended at a later date, and I will champion its amendment if indeed the reassurances prove insufficient.</span>

                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">
                    <a href="83D" type="MemberSpeech">
                      <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Mr MURPHY</span>
                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Reid</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">17:59</span>):  I wish to make some comments about the amended Defence Trade Controls Bill, which has generated concern among a number of very respected scientific research academics that I have consulted with. This bill in part seeks to implement new controls on intangible transfers—that is, transfers of information—relating to a wide variety of technologies with both military and civilian applications. The academics are concerned that the legislation, including the amendments, appears to produce the unintended consequence of significantly curtailing innovative research conducted in academic institutions.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">It is clear that the Defence Trade Controls Bill does not intend to place undue restrictions on academic researchers or to control activities conducted in the course of normal academic research or education. However, the academics I have spoken with are very concerned that the original bill would not adequately protect against this possibility and would require amendment in order to protect the academic sector. I am aware of what happened in the Senate yesterday and I listened to the minister today.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">At issue is the scope of impact of the legislation and its potential to subject to defence controls ordinary research activities across a range of fields. In particular, I believe it is sensible to exclude from controls basic and applied academic research conducted with the intent of generating knowledge and providing for the public good. Such research poses little risk to national security. It is not related to defence, munitions or other arms but, rather, the development of new technologies that support future industry and innovation. By contrast, potentially stifling this research poses significant risk for Australia's economic prosperity.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The shortcomings of this legislation's regulatory impact statement were highlighted in the Senate FADT Committee's preliminary report. Following the committee's preliminary report the academic sector engaged in consultations with Defence chaired by the Chief Scientist, Professor Ian Chubb. I am pleased that the consultations have resolved many of the concerns. The Senate committee's final report makes clear that this bill should not put universities in Australia at a disadvantage relative to their international counterparts.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Submission 11B to the Senate FADT Committee provides legal advice that the legislation presented to it would put in place stringent controls on public-good applied research that do not appear in comparable legislation in the United States, thus contradicting the committee's report. I understand that the Chief Scientist has other legal advice relating to the comparative disadvantage the legislation would cause for Australian academics. However, this evidence has not been part of the public record relating to this legislation or the Senate committee's inquiry. The Chief Scientist has publicly recommended that any potential negative impacts would be assessed and mitigated during the two-year trial period associated with the legislation. I am happy that the legislation now provides for this. I am convinced that Professor Chubb will seek positive outcomes for the sector during this period.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">However, given the importance of this legislation and the potential for negative unintended consequences, the scientific research academics I have consulted with do not believe we can rely on post-legislative corrections to this bill to resolve the outstanding issue of comparative disadvantage. Under these circumstances, I trust that the legislation ensures that (1) it delivers on the post-legislation transitional arrangements that have been recommended by the Chief Scientist following round table discussions with Defence, the university sector and other stakeholders; (2) Australian university researchers are not placed at a disadvantage regarding export controls when compared with their colleagues in the United States; and (3) the Senate Foreign Affairs, Defence and Trade Legislation Committee plays a role in scrutinising the implementation of the export control regime.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The government believes we should not place undue restrictions on academic researchers or control activities conducted in the course of normal academic research or education. I want to put on the record here tonight that I trust that the two-year trial period provides anxious scientific research academics with a degree of comfort in this regard.</span>

                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Melbourne</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">18:04</span>):  I will speak to amendment (9) and amendment (13), which is coming up shortly, for the convenience of the House and to avoid having to repeat my remarks. Everyone who says that they support academic freedom and that they support Australia's independence in this Asian century will very soon have a chance to vote for it, because this bill, if it gets through in the form proposed by the government, will hamper research, hamper academic freedom and hamper our independence. Even worse, we are about to be asked to strip out of this bill a key protection that was inserted into it after the coalition moved an amendment that the Greens supported in the Senate.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This bill has a very wide scope. It catches research that is being conducted in connection with a list known as the defence and strategic goods list. It can be equipment, the nature of the research or the people with whom one is coming into contact that can potentially overlap with this list. This list has an index of 79 pages and is in itself a 380-page technical document. If your research overlaps with something on that list, you are caught by the bill. If that is the case, it is not simply that there are a few hoops you have to jump through. If your research is caught by this bill and you do not comply with the provisions of it, you face criminal penalties as a researcher in this country. You have to ask for a permit to have your research published.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">It also affects the basic conduct of research itself—your communications with people in another country. It will affect you when people come from another country to visit you. If you collaborate with an institute in Asia, you will be caught by this. You are subject to criminal penalties if you do not comply with the requirements of this bill, which themselves are only understandable by reference to a 380-page technical document.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This is not some abstract point; this is going to affect research done all the time by people in this country. As the University of Sydney told the Senate, it will affect it will affect quantum physics research. One academic there said that this would be an onerous regulatory regime requiring allocation of the significant resources to monitoring and managing the requirements that would otherwise be devoted to research. He said:</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">

                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This is not someone who is doing research, writing a blueprint for some weapon that they are about to send to another country; they are doing research in quantum physics. The government may say that this will not affect basic research, that it is only research done with an intended purpose. Having spent some time talking to researchers over many years, I know that so much of the research is done now in connection with a potential application and inventions like Wi-Fi come when you are researching something completely different, as CSIRO knows all too well. It is absolutely correct when the University of Sydney says that this will affect potentially melanoma research. One research says:</span>

                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">There would be a chilling effect on participation by foreigners in our biomedical research, and the probability that important research in human biology and medicine might never be done. There would be increased compliance costs, with resulting reduced effectiveness of Commonwealth research infrastructure funding, reduced effectiveness of private funding to independent research institutes, and slowing of research. In the health research sector it has been robustly demonstrated that investment saves lives and increases welfare, so a reduction of investment through increased costs, or non-approval of research, will have a real and potentially quantifiable cost in lives and human welfare.</span>

                    </a>  I am told to keep it short by the shadow minister, who is asking me to not defend the amendment moved by the coalition in the Senate. This is incredibly important for the conduct of academics in Australia and their research. One of their main criticisms has been that this has been rushed through, some say to coincide with the future visit from the US Secretary of State. There has been complaint after complaint about how quickly this process has been pushed through this parliament, and the fact that it took the Greens in the Senate to get the two-year review that some on the government benches are relying on to now support the passage of the bill suggests that this bill had problems in it from the start. Of course, the government to their credit have acknowledged that there are problems and worked to find some solutions, but those solutions have not been found because we now still have at the last minute, just today, Universities Australia saying to this place that the Senate's decision—that is, the passage of the coalition and Greens amendment:</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">… to match the US exclusion from fundamental research is an important step in ensuring a level playing field for export controls. Universities Australia calls upon the House of Representatives to give this serious consideration, as the Senate has done.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The Society of University Lawyers tells us that there is a real likelihood that the bill as currently drafted may do more harm than the risks it seeks to address, and they seek the support of this place for changes. The National Tertiary Education Union says they are alarmed at the inclusion of an amendment which, if passed into law, would create a criminal offence for the publication of certain material related to dual use technologies. So here we have being rushed through a bill in which, at the last minute, the universities and the academics are pleading with us to include some basic protection for research that is not intended to be caught by this. I think everyone in this House would agree that national security is important and that there should be restrictions, as suggested in the Senate, on providing a blueprint for some kind of weapon to someone who is an enemy of this country. If we are really concerned about that, perhaps we should be looking at what we are doing with our potentially deadly uranium and where, after second and third countries, that might find its way and into whose hands. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">If it was simply a bill about dealing with that, that would be one thing, but it is not about dealing with that. The government and the opposition know it, which is why there has been a scramble to find a solution. What we know, because the experts and the people who are going to be affected by this are telling us very clearly, is that if this passes we have not fixed the problem. In fact, we are now introducing a potentially chilling regime into research in Australia and we are doing it quickly when there is absolutely no need to do it quickly and there is every need to give our researchers more time so that we can come up with a solution.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I hear the government's point that the amendment which provides the exemption is broadly drafted. The Greens moved a different kind of amendment in the Senate which was unsuccessful but which provided a defence for academics, rather than an exemption, a defence they were able to rely on to avoid prosecution. That was unsuccessful, but in the absence of that defence we need this amendment to remain and we need this protection to apply.  Otherwise we are about, for the first time, to introduce criminal sanctions on our researchers at a time when they are telling us, 'You do this and it will affect the biomedical research that we do, it will affect the research into physics that we do, it will affect the research into infectious diseases that we do.'  It is up to us in this place to listen to them and to heed the last minute plea of Universities Australia that we do what the Senate do—that is, maintain Australia's independence and maintain the freedom of our researchers to conduct their own research without fear that they may end up in jail.</span>

                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">
                    <a href="IYS" type="MemberSpeech">
                      <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Mr OAKESHOTT</span>
                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Lyne</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">18:15</span>):  I support the words of the member for Melbourne. I ask, hoping it is the view of colleagues around me as well, for reconsideration by both the major parties in this chamber of supporting what looked to be an eminently sensible amendment, approved by the Senate yesterday, moved by Senator Johnston of the Liberal Party and supported by the Greens. But here in this chamber today, 24 hours later, we have the Liberal and National parties opposing the motion they themselves successfully moved in the Senate. I ask this chamber: what on earth has happened in the last 24 hours; who has talked to whom to force that change of position?</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I would ask everyone to look at proposed section 9A. Od section 9A. On paper, you will see a sensible amendment that asks for nothing more than the same standards of access and exemptions for Australian researchers that apply to US researchers. What on earth is this chamber doing voting against equity for Australian researchers with their US counterparts? Why on earth, in our sovereign interests, would we be voting against that? That is what I ask both the Minister for Defence and the shadow minister for defence. I also invite the minister for education and the shadow minister for education to come down and participate in this debate to explain why bipartisanship on military affairs matters more than bipartisanship on education affairs in Australia's sovereign interests.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We are two days into the so-called Asian century. I have heard lots of talk about the importance of education and how partnerships with neighbouring countries in the Asia-Pacific are going to matter and will grow over time. This bill is the first action that we as a parliament have taken following the release of Ken Henry's work on Australia in the Asian century. This is a step backwards for those partnerships with other countries rather than a step forward based on the principles of open science and research, and partnerships and collaborations with neighbouring countries and institutions. This is the handing-over of command and control of the research sector to the minister at the table, the Minister for Defence—and, whilst I am sure that is not the intent, that is not the way it is being delivered in the UK and it is not the way it is being delivered in the US. I accept the need and the want for global agreements in this area, but we have handed over delivery of this to the Defence portfolio and saying Australian research in Australian education institutions is secondary to the wants and needs of Defence. We are entering McCarthyist territory if we accept that. It is extraordinary to see a minister being allowed to do that in a cabinet that says education matters.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I think it is telling that, in the last 24 hours, we have gone from seeing the Liberal Party, with the Greens, get this proposed section 9A approved in the Senate yesterday, for good and sensible reasons, to seeing the Liberal and National parties opposing it in this House today. I ask: what is going on? And I do not like what I think is the answer. It is of great concern who has got to whom over the last 24 hours.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I also put to bed the notion that this is just some University of Sydney issue, which is the pitch that has been made to me and others. I have emails from the Australian National University. I have emails from the University of Technology, Sydney. Universities Australia has today come out and said that what happened in the Senate last night was sensible and something that deserved this chamber's support. <span style="font-style:italic;">(Extension of time granted)</span><span style="font-style:italic;"></span>I cannot understand why anyone would argue against what was approved in the Senate last night. If it is so broadly drafted that it means nothing, then so what? Leave it in.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The fact that we have a minister approving 26 amendments but only fighting one and we have a Liberal Party approving this in the Senate yesterday but now going against it in the Reps says that there is a dirty little story about section 9A that needs to be told by both parties. It is at the expense of the education sector in Australia. I ask both parties to stand up and explain exactly what the problem is with this proposed section 9A. It is in defence of open research and science.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I also want to raise the issue of proposed section 14A, which is the second issue of critical concern that remains in this bill and which was a late government amendment. I was not going to make an issue of that if coalition support for section 9A in the Senate was maintained in this House, but it looks like there is bipartisanship on removing 9A. That brings 14A into play, and what that says is quite extraordinary for the research sector in Australian education today. It says that, if any researcher—even those with good intentions and working in good faith—publishes what has to date been open scientific research for the public good, it is a criminal offence.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The McCarthyist intent may be honourable, but the delivery through this legislation is dangerous. It is jeopardising our commitment to a research sector in Australia that I would have thought is important to all of us in the many fields that we deal with in this chamber, from food and fibre production all the way through to the medical and health sciences. The kinds of science that are covered by this Defence Trade Controls Bill are innovation advancing public health, improving agriculture, mining and manufacturing, and supporting Australia's civilian innovation sector. That is because this research sometimes also has military applications. Open scientific research is, however, low or no risk in respect of military applications. For that reason, why on earth are we leaving that exposed, and why on earth are we therefore including a criminal offence for a researcher in that space?</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I express my deepest want: for the minister, the shadow minister and the carriers of the education portfolios on both sides to have another look at this. Those two areas in particular should not pass in the form that they are in. We should be supporting what the Liberal Party put up in the Senate yesterday and had the potential to get through this chamber today. I find it extraordinary that they have chosen for some reason today to fold their cards. I will not. I will oppose this on behalf of the education sector of Australia, and I ask the shadow minister at the table to talk to his colleagues. They might get a win if they have another look at this.</span>

                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Dobell</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">18:23</span>):  I find it absolutely extraordinary that the Labor Party, in weighing up the choice between military and education interests, are putting military interests in front of educational interests. It is absolutely extraordinary that we find this situation—particularly from the government, who have prided themselves on the many good things that they have done in terms of education. A choice has been put there, a choice that they did not need to make—by adopting clause 9A they would get the outcome that they need—but they have decided to make a choice between education and military interests, and they have gone with military interests. I find that, on one hand, extraordinary.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I find it equally mind-blowing that the coalition can see the problems in the Defence Trade Controls Bill 2011 and, quite correctly, moved an amendment less than 24 hours ago, but 24 hours later they are actually going to oppose their own amendment here in this place. What is happening in this place? It is unprecedented that we are seeing this type of approach in relation to what should be bipartisan interests in making sure that Australia is a smart country, that we are giving every opportunity for researchers, rather than curtailing it.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">What I think is most disappointing in this legislation is that, if this amendment is not passed, if we disallow what the Senate quite rightly put last night, we are going to end up with Australian researchers being treated in an inferior way to US researchers. I thought that in this country we were well beyond dipping the hat in colonial style to our partners, that we were a more mature country than that, that we had reached the stage where we could actually have partnerships on an equal footing, but apparently that is not the case. Apparently equal footing is something that the two major parties are going to oppose here in a bipartisan approach. That is absolutely extraordinary.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This legislation is complex, but one thing that almost every speaker in the Senate from both the Labor side and the coalition side complained about in this debate was that there was not enough consultation, that the matters had been rushed and that there were problems in relation to a whole range of proposals with this legislation, which is why the minister is here today making and supporting 26 amendments. But one of the most crucial amendments, an amendment that would have seen Australian researchers treated in the same way as those in the US, for some reason is being opposed.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">In this country, under this regime, we are taking a totally different approach to that of the US or that of the UK. We are rushing through legislation. The great hope that both parties have said we have here—and I commend the contribution of the member for Reid, except that he is accepting that corrections can be made to this legislation in the two-year period afterwards. The history of this legislation is that it has been through Senate committees, where there were complaints about the way in which consultation had taken place—that it had been rushed. We are having it rushed into the Senate. We are having it rushed through the House of Representatives. For what reason? To disadvantage Australian researchers.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Surely, in this piece of legislation, the benefit of the doubt must go to the researchers. This amendment put forward by the coalition is in almost identical terms to that in the United States, so, if it were passed, we would see Australian researchers having the same provisions, the same issues, that they have in the United States. Instead, what we are doing is making researchers fear criminal sanctions, with up to 10 years in jail. The way both parties have approached this piece of legislation is a disgrace, and it does no credit to this House that we are going to end up where we are going to end up today.</span>

                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">New England</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">18:28</span>):  I join with the other crossbenchers to express some concern about the rush that is occurring within this building today. I will make a suggestion to the minister in a minute and maybe the shadow minister will be interested to hear it as well. This is one of the few occasions in my parliamentary career in which I have seen this sort of activity occur. I saw it when the US free trade agreement was being debated. At that time, there were a whole range of side deals for a whole range of reasons outside the necessary interests of the Australian community. I reflected at that time that there were very real concerns about the way in which that particular deal was put together. I appreciate all the pressures in terms of the diplomacy et cetera and America being a friend—all of those things. But I think that if people were to go back and have a close look at the US free trade agreement and the implications that it has had and will have in certain areas—particularly in terms of pharmaceuticals and other products—as the years unwind, they would see reasons to slow this process down to give people a real look at what is actually going on here.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">What has happened in the last 24 hours? I do not want to reiterate what previous speakers have said, but something has happened. The minister and particularly the shadow minister need to explain what has happened. What happened such that the position of the Liberal Party now is different to what it was 24 hours ago? People need to understand that.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I would urge the minister to take my next point on board. I suggest, Minister, that it might be appropriate to adjourn this debate and let some fresh air drift around on this issue so that people can better get their heads around it. The bill can be reintroduced, if required, when parliament resumes in a few weeks time. That would give people in the research industry, such as those at universities, more time. These people are genuinely concerned. I have had any number of emails, some particularly related to agriculture and agricultural research, an area that none of would think would be implicated in terms of relationships with the United States or defence—and during the striking of some of the free trade agreements over time most of us did not think that they would be implicated, either. The concerns that some people may have had were brushed aside, with people saying, 'No, that is not the intent.' But as time has passed it has become quite clear what the intent was.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The community needs to know how intentions have changed in the last 24 hours, and particularly how the positions that the Liberal Party, the National Party and the Greens took in the Senate have changed compared to what is happening now. I suggest to the minister and to the government that it may be in their interests and, more importantly, the interests of this debate that the debate be adjourned until we return in a couple of weeks time for the final week of parliament. I would like the minister to explain—and perhaps the shadow minister can as well—why that cannot happen. Why can't there be an adjournment of this debate until the parliament returns?</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">It is worth bearing in mind, as I said in general terms in my earlier remarks, that the government, in response to the preliminary report from the Senate committee, asked Mr Peacock, the Chief Defence Scientist and the Chief Scientist to engage in consultations and a roundtable. Every one of the recommendations made at that roundtable have been adopted by the government, presented to the Senate and agreed to by the Senate. They are supported by the government on the floor of the chamber today. The suggestion that this has all been done in a great rush is, frankly, hyperbole and overegging it.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The Parliamentary Joint Standing Committee on Treaties recommended more than two years ago that legislation be brought into this parliament ratifying the treaty between the United States and Australia for trade in defence. Everyone at the time recognised that that would open up enormous possibilities for Australian industry, Australian defence industry and Australian education and research. It would open up enormous possibilities, because it means that you would not have to get individual export approval for every access that an Australian company might get to a US foreign material sale so far as defence is concerned.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I know that members have been focusing on the narrow issue of national security considerations in defence export areas, both in terms of the Australian context and in terms of the United States context. But let us just pause and remember for one moment that this treaty has been around for four or five years. The Parliamentary Joint Standing Committee on Treaties recommended ratification. The United States Senate effected ratification nearly two years ago to this day. A draft bill was put out for consultation with interested parties as early as May of 2011. When the preliminary report from the Senate came down earlier this year, I asked Mr Peacock, the Chief Defence Scientist and the Chief Scientist, Mr Chubb, to engage in consultations to address whatever reasonable concerns were expressed at that stage by the university and the research sector. Ever one of the recommendations adopted by the roundtable that was chaired by Professor Chubb, the Chief Scientist who used to be the well-respected vice-chancellor at ANU and who from memory used to chair the G8, has been adopted by the Senate and recommended by me for adoption by the House today.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Indeed, on 11 October, Universities Australia put out a press release saying how pleased they were with the fact that all of those things had been effected. Proposed amendment (9) in the message from the Senate, which I am saying that we should not adopt, was not part of these proposals.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">It is a new proposal, found in the Senate. It is not part of these proposals.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">On 11 October, Universities Australia, priding itself as the peak body representing Australia's 39 universities, said that they strongly supported those recommendations, all of which have been adopted in the Senate and recommended for adoption here. Today, and this is not said critically, they put out a press release saying that the House should give 'serious consideration, as the Senate has done,' to the amendment in question. I have done that and I have come to the conclusion that to do that would undermine, fundamentally, the basic structure of the bill and would not meet the standards required to ratify the treaty. Also, it goes further than is required to meet the balance between the national security and defence export requirements and freedom of academic research and freedom of research.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The adoption of amendment (9) would fundamentally undermine the fabric of the legislation. Today, Universities Australia said that we should give serious consideration to this issue and that:</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">The principle that Australian researchers are not disadvantaged compared to other countries will be embedded and refined through the two year pilot and transition period.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">One of the strengths of the amendments circulated by the government, adopted by the Senate and presented here, is that the transition phase will allow all of those concerns to be observed, monitored and refined, if and when required. We have a transition period of two years, we have a steering group of industry, research and government representatives, chaired by the Chief Scientist. This group will consider the effect of the controls to ensure that they do strike the appropriate balance, as I have outlined: the balance between meeting our international obligations and academic and research freedom. There will be pilots during the transition period. Those assessments will come back to the minister—whether it is me; it will be the minister of the day. And, importantly, the bill does not include any domestic controls. We are talking here about export, so there is no imposition on research conducted and effected in Australia that is for domestic purposes.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Members have made the point that we should adopt this because amendment (9), the proposed section 9A, puts us on a comparable basis with the United States. That fails to appreciate a fundamental difference between the way in which the United States approaches these matters and the way in which we do. The effect of the amendment, in my view, would be that anyone who is claiming to be conducting fundamental research in Australia would be exempt from the provisions of the bill. That is a far broader effect than the US exemption, which is for fundamental research, but which only applies to research outputs. Research inputs are subject to US export controls. There is no US exception that would allow controlled technology to be exported from the US for fundamental research without US government authorisation. So, to say that this puts us on the same footing as US scientists is wrong, because they apply a fundamentally different approach. What we are doing is using our own law, our own approach and our own system to strike the appropriate balance between effecting the international obligation in ratifying the treaty and the national security requirements of defence exports. At the same time we are balancing that with academic and research freedom. If we have that balance wrong we have the two-year transition to make sure that that can be monitored carefully—pilot programs and a government-industry-academic-research steering group—to look at the effect of these measures in practice.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The bald assertion that somehow on the one hand we are putting ourselves in an inferior position to United States scientists, but that on the other hand we should adopt precisely their measures, misunderstands the fundamentally different nature of the way in which we approach these issues as a jurisdiction or a country, and the way in which the United States does.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">To summarise those issues, the notion that we have been seized of these issues at six o'clock tonight is just wrong. This is a treaty proposal that has been floating around for years. The first draft bill emerged in the first half of 2011. There have been two Senate committee inquiries, a preliminary report and a subsequent one. There have been consultations conducted by Mr Peacock, the Chief Defence Scientist and the Chief Scientist, and the bringing forward of recommendations, all of which are recommended for adoption. The amendment in the message from the Senate, which I am recommending to the House we reject, was not part of those proposals. It fails from a fundamental mistaken assumption that the US system is the same as ours. It is not.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The measures before the House, on my recommendation, strike the appropriate balance. If for some reason in practice that is shown to be wrong you have a two-year monitoring pilot program with in-practice capacity to make whatever changes at the margins are required.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The essential and simple choice here is that we either effect legislation of sufficient standard to ratify the treaty, or we do not. To include amendment (9) would diminish the standard of the legislation required to meet the international obligation to ratify the treaty, and on that basis the House should reject it.</span>

                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Fadden</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">18:43</span>):  Let me provide some brief comments back to the members of the cross benches. I thank them for their contributions and I understand some of their concerns—and from where they are sitting, some could say that things seem a little odd.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Let me refute the issue that there is some grubby deal between the government and the opposition. I think question time would leave the nation in no doubt that it is very difficult for the government and the opposition to agree on some very large issues, and the idea that we could do some backroom deal is, I think, a little silly in the extreme. However, there is no question and there is no doubt that the government and the opposition share an enormous bipartisanship when it comes to defence, and no-one can argue that I have shown anything other than bipartisanship in the key areas of defensive matters, including combat operations, troop dispositions, the welfare of our fighting men and women and, of course, our alliance structures.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The amendment last night in the Senate was moved in good faith. The government raised a range of concerns they believed were legitimate. They raised them forcefully, and they raised them in the spirit of bipartisanship. On the basis of that I was prepared to give the government the benefit of the doubt. Having dealt with this government now for four years as part of the shadow defence team, I have worked out when the government is dealing with issues that they truly believe are significant in the national interest and when they are dealing with issues that suit political interests. I must say, the government expressed this in very clear national interest terms—clear enough for us to say: 'We understand it. We respect your position. We will provide a degree of benefit of the doubt.' That degree, of course, is encompassed within a two-year 'cooling off period', for want of a better expression. That gives the parliament the opportunity within that space to assess, with very clear eyes, what—if any—impact there is.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Be under no doubt that if the research sector or the university is being fundamentally impacted the coalition will champion their cause vigorously. But right now the key issue in terms of defence and the trade treaty, which has been around for a long time—in the absence of overwhelming support or overwhelming evidence that the university or research sectors will be harmed—is to provide the government the support they need, and that is what I will be doing.</span>

                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Lyne</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">18:46</span>):  In what is hopefully a final response, I will say that I do not in any way, in speaking in this debate, question bipartisanship in defence matters. But I do place the charge before the House that the standard of bipartisanship in defence is now bipartisanship in creating criminal sanctions for researchers in Australian universities. That is the bipartisanship the crossbenchers today have spoken about that is of concern. It is not a matter of whether we support a defence treaty with the UN. I love Ambassador Bleich. I have been to America.</span>

                    </a>  Well, he's great company. I do not question anything about Australia's relationship with the US. I actually think we can deliver the treaty agreements in a way, through this chamber, that has unanimous support in the lower house and the upper house as a really strong message from the Australian parliament. But we do not need, in defence terms, collateral damage. And the collateral damage of this bill is researchers at Australian institutions who are now, under law, potentially—under 14A—to face criminal charges if, even in good faith, they publicise their research in the way they have in the past. They have to now meet a standard of approval with the Minister for Defence, which is an extraordinary takeover of the education portfolio in the research field. That is the concern before the House today. It is not about whether we have a treaty arrangement with the US or about all that we want to deliver for the impending visit of secretaries of state—or any of the other reasons to enhance our relationship with the US. None of that is in question, but there is a charge before the House today that remains unanswered: that researchers are getting a raw deal through this legislation.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">There is now a criminal offence that has been written into law, and I do not accept the minister's argument that Australian researchers, in a highly competitive area—an area we want to grow in this country—now face a lesser standard in their ability to do open research, collaborate, and have partnerships with other institutions and other researchers compared with researchers in the US and the UK, who are also meeting these similar defence treaty agreements. It is not a matter of whether we do it in defence; it is how we do it, and how we do it without impacting open scientific research and fundamental research in Australia today.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">In the responses I just heard from both the minister and the shadow minister, I heard the word 'fundamental' about half a dozen times. And in a world where the <span style="font-style:italic;">Macquarie Dictionary</span> seems to define all we do, I heard that we are fundamentally undermining the fabric of the legislation. I heard that Australia is fundamentally different in the way we do research compared with the US, and that the crossbenchers fundamentally misunderstand what is really going on here in this legislation. I also heard that the only reason so far that there has been a massive change of position from the coalition is that somehow there is an acceptance now that this would fundamentally impact on defence and military issues for Australia.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I put the words 'fundamental research' on the table. That is exactly what you are knocking out: fundamental research that was written into section 9A by the coalition, to their credit, in the Senate last night, for all the right reasons. And now, for some reason, they have backed away from it. And now, of all the 27 amendments before this chamber, this is the one the minister rejects. I put it to this House again: why? And the 'why' needs to be answered in full, in detail. I will not support any attack on Australian universities that this looks to be doing in its current form.</span>

                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Melbourne</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">18:50</span>):  Just very briefly, on this question that was posed very well by the member for New England—why can't we wait another month?—yes, there have been inquiries and round tables. But the criminal sanction that the universities and the academics are most anxious about, with very good cause, was circulated by the government as an amendment only after the Senate inquiry reported and after the round table. It is for that reason that there is, in effect, a last-minute amendment to a bill and an idea that has been out there for a period of time and that is causing great angst amongst our research community. If the issues were resolved we would not be having last-minute pleas from, on one hand, Universities Australia and, on the other hand, the National Tertiary Education Union on behalf of producers of research and those defending the rights of academics to freedom and independence for further consideration.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">It is manifestly clear that this recent amendment imposing a sanction is not one that has the accord of key people in the sector. The Asian Century does not appear to have gotten off to a good first week. If it is the case that the United States is able to dictate what research we conduct and with whom, and to place a fundamental break on the work that is being conducted that is going to set this country up for the 21st century, this is a very worrying sign of things to come.</span>

                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Dobell</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">18:52</span>):  Can I say in response to what the minister has said that, if he is right that we have misunderstood the legislation, if he is right that the university sector has misunderstood the legislation, if he is right that the university lawyers have misunderstood the legislation, if he is right that the law firm that the universities got to do their work on have misunderstood the legislation, if he is right that the education union has misunderstood the legislation, if he is right that the coalition and Greens senators last night misunderstood the legislation, then surely he has made the case that the member for New England set out—that we should not be dealing with this legislation now, in such haste, until all of those parties understand the legislation, understand the intent, so that we can go forward.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The minister's response has clearly made the case that this legislation is contested, that people have different views about, and in his view is misunderstood, there is a very easy solution to make sure that this legislation is fully understood by all of those groups that he says misunderstand it: to not push it through tonight, to take up the offer that the member for New England put in good faith—and that is to reintroduce this legislation the next time we sit here in Canberra and spend that time making sure we understand the legislation, those groups understand the legislation and the industry understands the legislation; because there can only be two options here: either the legislation is in such a form that it is easily misunderstood or in fact the minister is wrong and it does have the effect that the crossbenchers have spoken about today, that it is deleterious to the research sector. It can only be one of those two positions, and surely, for such an important issue, it is worth making sure we get it right. This is something that should not be rushed through today. If we do this we are making a grave mistake and we need to be making sure that higher education is given the courtesy, the respect and the emphasis and priority that it deserves.</span>

                    <a href="00ATG" type="MemberSpeech">
                      <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Mr SHORTEN</span>
                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Maribyrnong</span>—<span class="HPS-MinisterialTitles">Minister for Financial Services and Superannuation and Minister for Employment and Workplace Relations</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">19:03</span>):  The Gillard government made an election commitment in 2010 to better protect the entitlements of Australian employees impacted by the insolvency or bankruptcy of their employer. This commitment, entitled the Protecting Workers' Entitlements package, was to provide the strongest protection of employee entitlements working Australians have ever seen. So I rise to commend to the House the bill which embeds our commitment to this package as it relates to the fair entitlements guarantee. In doing so, the Fair Entitlements Guarantee Bill 2012 will replace the existing General Employee Entitlements and Redundancy Scheme, GEERS, and enshrine the fair entitlements guarantee in legislation. Labor is proud to guarantee these additional protections for Australian workers under law. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The bill will provide certainty for Australian employees who find themselves without a job and left out of pocket when their employer becomes insolvent or bankrupt and cannot pay the workers the employment entitlements accrued by the workers which they are owed by their employer. On this side of the House, we know that employees who lose their job through the insolvency or bankruptcy of their employer have enough to worry about. They have to worry about where their next mortgage repayment will come from. They have to worry about what money will be available to cover unexpected bills and emergencies. Those of us on this side of the House believe that individuals should not have to worry about being paid what they have already earned.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This bill will protect Australian employees under circumstances which are brought about through no fault or choice of their own or their own actions. It will also ensure that Australian employees who are victims of employer insolvency or bankruptcy, where employment entitlements are owed, are supported by a government that actually supports Australian workers. In doing so, this bill will also enshrine Labor's commitment to the Australian sense of a fair go, by providing a legislative framework employees can rely on and an entitlement which, unlike the employment entitlements those opposite advocate for, cannot be scrapped with the flick of a pen.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This government has always recognised the importance of protecting the entitlements of Australian employees who suffer the effects of the insolvency or bankruptcy of their employer. This bill will replace the existing General Employee Entitlements and Redundancy Scheme, GEERS, and strengthen protection of unpaid entitlements, including redundancy, annual leave, long service leave, wages and payment in lieu of notice. The bill also improves existing GEERS arrangements by removing the eligibility requirement associated with deeds of company arrangements so that a minority of vulnerable workers are no longer disadvantaged; extending coverage to all entitlements that accrue where employees continue to work past the appointment of an insolvency practitioner; and simplifying transfer of business claims from 1 July 2014 so that employees will no longer be ineligible for assistance unless their new employer recognises their service and entitlement.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This bill represents a significant strengthening of the protection of the entitlements of Australian employees who are the victims of employer insolvency or bankruptcy. Contrary to some criticism, the bill does not open the door for a business to restructure at a cost to the taxpayer. The government has worked constructively with business in the development of this bill to ensure there are strong safeguards to ensure that people do not take advantage of the scheme by bumping up entitlements that would otherwise not be sustainable costs to the employer if they continued in business. Furthermore, this bill does not create a new community standard for redundancy entitlements; nor does it favour unionised workplaces.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The bill is simply structured to ensure that entitlements owed to an individual in the five broad areas previously noted, and in accordance with whatever their working conditions entitle them to, are able to be paid subject to reasonable thresholds. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This evening Labor delivers on its commitment for a clear and fair legislative framework to provide certainty and protection for Australia's workers, and with the passing of this bill the government will deliver on its pledge to Australian employees by providing a clear, fair and robust legislative framework to protect entitlements that Australians have already accrued at work. The Fair Entitlements Guarantee Bill is supported by the Labor government and a range of stakeholders.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I take this opportunity to thank the government members who spoke on the Fair Entitlements Guarantee Bill 2012 and hope those opposite will also support this bill, even if their amendments are defeated, to ensure even stronger protections for working Australians across our nation.</span>

The amendments will clarify that, as intended, the rules in clauses 12 and 25 may be applied if the delegate is satisfied it was reasonable to expect that the employer could not meets its obligations at the end of employment as well as during the employment. </span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">In speaking very briefly, I would like to refer the House to my remarks made during the second reading stage of the bill. I note that the coalition is now moving an amendment to include a cap on the redundancy payout captured in this bill at 16 weeks, which I note is in line with Labor's Fair Work Act. Ultimately, we believe that, as the taxpayer has to bear the cost of these payments, it is most important that we keep these at a limit that is in line with community expectation. As noted by the minister, the bill actually enshrines in legislation a redundancy package, calculated at four weeks per year of service, which would, we believe, set a new high bar that union bosses could use as a new high bar in enterprise bargaining. The coalition maintains its fiscal prudence—its cautious approach—and we will keep the redundancy package as it is under GEERS now, in line with community expectations and capped at 16 weeks.</span>

                      <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Mr SHORTEN</span>
                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Maribyrnong</span>—<span class="HPS-MinisterialTitles">Minister for Financial Services and Superannuation </span><span class="HPS-MinisterialTitles">and Minister for Employment and Workplace Relations</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">19:11</span>):  We can advise the House that the government will be opposing the opposition amendments. Taking the member for Farrer's encouragement to be brief, we will try to do that. The reason we are opposing the amendments is that we had a policy on workers' entitlements before the last election, and we are implementing them. We do not believe that we should adhere to opposition amendments which were not flagged at the last election and are not part, as far as we can tell, of any appreciable opposition policy. It is policy on the run, which we have learnt about today. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Our proposition is that, subject to eligibility requirements, employees will be eligible for unpaid entitlements, including wages, redundancy pay, payment in lieu of notice, annual leave and long service leave. Under our bill, redundancy pay is capped at a maximum of four weeks per year of service, but this is not setting a new community standard. What this is doing is saying: 'If you already have a pre-existing industrial instrument which says that you are eligible for four weeks each year in the case of redundancy, we think that if a company becomes insolvent, you should not be short-changed.' This is not saying that everyone in Australia has a new standard, and it is fallacious to link the minimum standard of redundancy in the Fair Work Act, which is a minimum, and start saying that that is therefore the community standard. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The other reason we stand so strongly in favour of the four-week proposition is that, if these matters had been negotiated between employees and employers, we believe that the people most likely to benefit from this proposition are longstanding employees. Under the opposition's proposal, once you have basically done four years in a company, you get nothing more. What the opposition will be doing with their amendments is enshrining a short-term view of people's loyalty, saying that, at four years, that's it. If you have worked as a machinist in an automotive components company for 20 years, they are saying, 'You might as well have only worked there for four years, because that is all we are giving you.'</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The other reason to oppose the opposition amendments, in essence, is this: workers do not rank first ahead of banks, so what this means in the corporations law system in terms of priority of entitlement when companies go broke is that, on one hand, if the opposition was saying they did not want any impost upon the taxpayer, then they would be moving a proposition to say workers should rank ahead of banks' secured interests, which they are not doing. What they want is the best of both worlds. They still want the banks to rank ahead of the workers— that is their choice; it is in their DNA—but what they are also saying is, 'We are going to short-change long-serving workers anyway.' You can't have it both ways. You can't deny the workers the right to have priority and still deny them the opportunity to get some recognition for their service under industrial instruments that they had already entered into. That is why we will oppose these amendments.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We certainly hope also that, in the event that the opposition is unsuccessful in getting its amendments up, it will still vote to protect workers' entitlements; after all, what we are by and large doing is implementing in statute an administrative scheme whose antecedents were formed in the Howard years. So what we see with these amendments is a short-changing of long-term loyal staff—no interest in ranking workers ahead of the banks' fixed secured interests. What we also see is a repudiation, in fact, of one of the few safety nets that the opposition put in place for workers when they were in government, imperfect though it was. So we would strongly urge the opposition not to vote against statutory protection for workers' entitlements in the event that their amendments are defeated.</span>

                      <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Mr JOHN COBB</span>
                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Calare</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">19:16</span>):  I rise to speak on the Water Amendment (Long-term Average Sustainable Diversion Limit Adjustment) Bill 2012. This bill is about trust; it goes to the heart of Labor's governance of our nation and asks the parliament to trust the Murray-Darling Basin Authority. The changes in this bill would allow amendments to be made without mandatory consultation with the public, without requiring the approval of the minister and via a regulation that is not disallowable. The MDBA would be given full responsibility for making the adjustments. Currently the basin authority does not fill me with confidence. Their public consultation process during the development of the basin plan showed that they just went through the motions. We all thought it would be better the second time, but they were not prepared to actually listen to the logical and reasonable concerns of the community within the basin. The basin plan has largely remained unchanged from the guide and there has been very poor details of, and transparency on, the science used in the decision-making process.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Unfortunately, under these amendments the MDBA will be placed in a more powerful position with no consultation being required and no recourse to the minister or the parliament. Furthermore, while the authority must seek and consider advice from the basin official committee it will not need to heed their advice and can carry on with its own agenda regardless.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The other issue is that the authority cannot make an adjustment that does not reflect an environmentally sustainable level of intake. Unfortunately, with Labor's amendments in 2008, the plan went from a plan to manage 30-odd Ramsar wetlands within the basin to 2,774 environmental sites. Let us be honest, that is a ridiculous overreach. Unfortunately, this amendment will encourage the government, under direction from the Greens, to add more and more environmental sites which are not based on science and force the authority to increase the take and further decimate rural communities. The coalition supports a mechanism that would allow for greater environmental benefits without imposing greater economic or social costs on the basin community. This is different from the government's view on social and economic benefits.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I want to go now to the cost of doing business in the basin. The reduction of water in the basin, without investment in infrastructure, has increased the cost of water production in the basin, which is having an impact on farmers struggling to get over the record drought. You have the same costs, for less water, spread among fewer people. So obviously it has increased enormously in some places, given the lack of planning that went into the buying in the first place. There have been enormous increases in costs for water transfer and water use by the farmers remaining. For example, the cost of doing business has increased by the removal of the 40 per cent AQIS inspection certificate rebate. That is a massive hit on our exporters, especially new and emerging industries, which have seen registration costs go up by 1,000 per cent.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">They can talk about the Asian century—and I actually believe very strongly in it, especially with our near neighbours, some of whom they have gone out of their way to upset—but these things are a massive increase in costs that make exports prohibitively expensive. Add to this the world's biggest carbon tax—and irrigators obviously use a considerable amount of power. They are asking our businesses to break into Asian markets against companies from countries that do not pay the carbon tax. I am sure you can get the picture about adding to costs—and that is exactly what is happening with irrigation.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The final point on that is the importance of R&amp;D in growing our production to make the most of it. The government talks about the importance of research, while wanting to reduce its involvement in and contribution to it. It says research and development is the key to capitalising on the Asian century, yet it axed Land and Water Australia and cut $63 million from CSIRO agricultural research—over $33 million was cut from the CRCs, and that means fewer agriculture CRCs are funded each year.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Labor also originally planned to support the Productivity Commission's report which recommended halving the government's contribution to R and D, and they have made no serious attempt at research into irrigation. In other words, you take away the water and people have to produce more with less. I do not see the government backing that with research. So the government says one thing and does another. But I guess we should not worry: they have put 'Asia' in the ministry title of the Minister for Trade, so they must be serious! And that is despite no funding and doing everything they can to undermine a lot of our opportunities in Asia, let alone anywhere else. I am concerned that the amendments in this bill will follow this similar pattern.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Just lately the government finally discovered investments in infrastructure and efficiency as the answer to delivering water to the environment. The government are using all this in their rhetoric now, but the facts are that they have spent $2 billion on water buybacks, while only $500 million of around the $5 billion in water efficiency projects and announcements last week were works and measures. The coalition has always supported priority investments, infrastructure and efficiency because they allow the government to recover water with minimal impact on communities—mind you, that was sharing the savings. On the other hand, while the $2 billion on water buybacks may be good for the stressed-out farmer, selling his water can be devastating for the community that has lost production, jobs and economic activity, leading to a loss in critical mass, leading to a loss in communities. It has actually brought about the situation where it is not the irrigators who are at the biggest risk but the communities that surround them.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I have no confidence that this government will invest in infrastructure over the longer term. Labor, supported by the Greens, will just revert back to the buyout of rural communities, because that is what the recently restored South Australian senator did. She just bought water without referral to where it was needed, without referral to any plan—without any plan, as a matter of fact, as I am sure the member for Watson is well aware.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">If you go to Deniliquin, Griffith, Swan Hill, Mildura or Shepparton and ask anyone on the streets whether the water buyback has been good for their communities, there will be a loud and resounding, 'No,' echoing from the empty business houses. This bill does go to the heart of the government's credibility. As a government, we had a plan. The plan was investing in the infrastructure and the farm work to the irrigation and saving the river by doing efficiencies and working with the industry, not getting rid of it.</span>

                    </a>  I should not respond, should I, across the table, Deputy Speaker Adams, so I will not, except to say that the member for Watson knows very well that was only a contingency in certain circumstances. He knows that very well.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We know that when it comes to agriculture—if you will excuse the pun—agriculture is at the bottom of our food chain. Everything they have done in government backs that up. Since 2007 the annual operating budget of the department of agriculture has more than halved. But this should not surprise you, as the department of agriculture has actually removed the word 'agriculture' from its mission statement, which is now:</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">We work to sustain the way of life and prosperity of all Australians.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Okay, well, that is a good thought. But it would be good to think about the people who actually live, work and own—for whom agriculture is what they do. But they do not get a mention anymore. Under the previous government, the department's mission was:</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">Increasing the profitability, competitiveness and sustainability of Australian agricultural, fisheries, forestry and food industries and enhancing the natural resource base to achieve greater national wealth and stronger rural and regional communities.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">That actually sounds like a mission statement for a section of the community that goes out of its way and punches above its weight and always has in Australia. However, none of those things apparently matter anymore. If the minister for agricultural is not standing up for agricultural then who is? I do not care what party you come from: when you have that job, your job is to work for it.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Getting back to the specifics of the issue, a mechanism that allows for a reduction of water required to achieve a target is a good thing. If the government can deliver outcomes to the environment by implementing investment in works and measures and that means outcomes can be achieved with less water, I am all for it. It is really the environment doing the same as the farm sector by learning to do better with less water. Perhaps, as I just said, those who work the environment can learn that as well. Farmers pride themselves on continuing to improve productivity and have been doing this for decades. If you water a wetland section by section, it makes sense that it will take less water than flooding the whole thing at once. It is the principle under which irrigation farms have operated for years. The world's population is heading to nine billion by 2030, so we cannot just cut production; we have to increase efficiencies, and we do have to learn to do more with less, which is why R and D should support that.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I will make a couple of comments in response to a speaker I heard earlier in the debate. Labor's member for Kingston said that if we do not restore this river there will be nothing: wetlands and flood plains will die. It does sound a bit like reckless negativity to me—I am not sure whether it is the <span style="font-style:italic;">Macquarie</span> definition before or after it has been changed to suit the government. One thing is clear: the decade-long drought is over, the river is flowing and there are no RIP signs up on any of the wetlands. Yes, we do need to manage the river, but the government has no water plan on how to use the existing water. So the claims by the member for Kingston can only be a reflection on the government's inability to show how water will achieve improved environmental outcomes, because currently it is quite obvious that neither the government nor the Murray-Darling Basin Authority have any idea how they are going to use the water that is being lined up simply for the environment.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The big lie in this debate was when Kevin Rudd stood at the mouth of the river and said, 'Give me an ETS and I'll fill the river.' Actually, it filled without one. Droughts do come to an end, even one that was the biggest in the lifetime of anyone in this place. I do not step back from the fact that we need to look after the environment. But that was a lie.</span>

Perhaps the recent delegation of Senator Wong to the second spot, since reinstated, as I hear—I will correct myself if that is just a rumour; perhaps the member for Watson—</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The reality is the Labor and the Greens have no skin in the game when it comes to seats in the basin and will never have any understanding of the basin communities. And it would seem they have never cared by the way they have processed this from day one. I repeat that: the problem here is that the Labor Party have no skin in the game when it comes to the Murray-Darling Basin, which is about half of one electorate. I support this mechanism but not without ministerial or parliamentary oversight so that the water required is lowered to achieve environmental outcomes, not to allow the government to expand its environmental imprint at the expense of basin communities. So I am unable to support this bill in its current form.</span>

                      <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Mr RAMSEY</span>
                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Grey</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">19:31</span>):  I rise to speak on the Water Amendment (Long-Term Average Sustainable Diversion Limit Adjustment) Bill 2012. The adjustment mechanism referred to in this bill has some agreement within the Australian community from the various parties, including the ministerial council. Because of that, it deserves to be taken seriously. I believe there are still some deficiencies in that plan, but I am hoping the minister can progress the negotiations and reach a good, sustainable outcome for the river from one end to the other.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">There are some deficiencies in this bill which will be addressed by the coalition's amendments, and I will come to those a little later. It is planned to return 2,750 gigalitres to the river and, as it has quite a lot of support across a number of communities, it deserves to be taken seriously. All of this falls within the coalition's long-term vision for the river system.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The sustainable diversion limits actually allow for flexibility within the management of the system. It seems to me to make sense that, as improvements are made within the system—whether funded by public funds or otherwise, but presumably funded by the taxpayer—the management plan has room to adapt. In that sense, I think a flexible arrangement is a good idea. If farm practices can be improved, presumably by public moneys, if production can be held stable or improved within the communities along the river, and if those communities are healthy in a financial sense, it makes some sense that there could be a reallocation of the water. Equally, if public moneys are spent to reengineer the river system and remove some of the constraints, to actually manage the water better in the flooding of the wetlands as we go down the river—and I am sure there are always improvements to be made in this area—then equally it makes sense that more water may become available for agricultural diversions. So it makes sense to have flexibility.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Importantly, decisions by the Murray-Darling Basin Authority must be made on sound scientific evidence, and the coalition has long been a supporter of this position. However, we do draw the line at a totally hands-off approach, divorcing the parliament from all responsibility. That brings us to the coalition's amendments in this area. Yes, the governing council, the Murray-Darling Basin Authority, should make the independent, scientifically driven decisions, but at the end of the day, we cannot totally muzzle the people's voice in this area. We live in a democracy and it is important that the people's voice be heard, and the parliament is the people's voice. That is why the coalition amendments seek to restore ministerial responsibility in this area. I hope we will be supported by the government. I think they are very good amendments.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">In the end, decisions made by the Murray-Darling Basin Authority could conceivably have large impacts on the federal budget or even, depending on the appointments of the commissioners, make decisions that are not well based—decisions of the heart rather than of science. In that case, the government, the parliament, must have the room to intervene. For those that worry that the allocation of water would then become a political football, I would say they should watch an old episode of <span style="font-style:italic;">Yes Minister</span>. I think the words would be: 'Any minister who chooses to overrule his independent authority is a very courageous minister.' I think it is right that we should put some power back in the hands of the minister but it should be used with great care. I am sure it would be, because any opposition worth its salt that would see a minister overruling his scientific council would wear some criticism.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">It is important in this debate that the parliament understand the great significance of the Murray River in South Australia. The average diversion limit to South Australia from 1997 to 2010 was seven per cent. Of that, 75 per cent is for primary production.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">As a representative of an electorate that has no irrigation in it but is a recipient of the Murray water—and the Murray water is very important to my electorate—I would just like to put the case at this stage for the sometimes much maligned non-irrigation use of water out of the river system. I make the case that anybody paying $3.73 a kilolitre for water is unlikely to waste it. In fact, they are likely to put it to very good use indeed. That price has risen by 50 per cent in South Australia in the last two years and that has led me to some criticism of the state government over a number of issues. Water has risen to $3.73 a kilolitre or by 50 per cent over the last two years. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">If we take the City of Whyalla, which is often raised in this place by the government, it uses around 15 gigalitres a year. It supports a population of 23,000. None of that city could be there without the River Murray water. The water has a very high multiplier effect, and is very important to communities all through South Australia, including our irrigation communities. It is also important to note, from a South Australian point of view—I know members from the eastern seaboard may be a little tired of hearing this—that extractions from the river have been capped in South Australia since 1969: a period of 43 years. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Progress on achieving an outcome for national management of the Murray Darling Basin has been slow. And there has been a series of mis-steps and mistakes by the government, including the sight of irrigators burning the draft report of the Murray-Darling plan—an exercise, I think, which antagonised all players in this game. I think, in retrospect, even the minister may wish that that original report had not gone out in that form and that it had some more careful consideration before it went out. I believe that that very confrontational blooding of the public to the views of the report entrenched positions and made it harder to achieve an outcome later.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">But it is important, I believe, that the coalition be part of the solution—that we do not frustrate an outcome in this area but actually work with the government to try and bring about the right results for the river. Now, let me say that while the figure of 2,750 gigalitres has been broadly agreed amongst some of the major parties, exactly how we arrive at that 2,750 gigalitres is still part of the debate, and I know the minister is probably working on this on a fairly regular basis. And I wish him well on achieving the right outcome, because whatever our political background, Australia will not thank us if we do not reach an outcome. And I want the minister to achieve that outcome.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">That deals with this bill and the amendments that pertain to this bill, but it brings me back to the announcement by the Prime Minister and Jay Weatherill, last weekend, of the extra 450 gigalitres. We are still waiting for the detail of that announcement. It worries me that it appears to be another of the cheap and fairly empty commitments from the government. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Look at the government's recent form on the NDIS, the Gonski report, the national dental health plans, the recently announced participation in the Asian century and, now, the Murray River. These are all announcements without specific funding. There are plenty of lofty goals and no money. And they are all outside the life of this government and even outside the life of the forward estimates. So they become very empty promises. Empty promises about a river that was recently empty are really not good enough. I believe, with the government's form across all of those subjects, the government has resigned itself to losing the next election, and is setting up to attack the incoming government from opposition.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">However, I do want to be part of positively moving this forward. So we wait to hear what those new commitments are that were made on the weekend. If the guarantees for future increases in environment flows are supported by irrigation efficiencies funded by the government, even though there does not appear to be much money in this announcement, then we should be flexible enough to allow for new circumstances. If the government of the day can find the money to fund these engineering works, both on farm and in the river, to release more water then we should be flexible enough to allow for new outcomes. But I think we need to draw some kind of line in the sand about the buyouts of licences that are currently occurring.  We simply cannot afford to achieve all of those outcomes through buyouts. The minister knows that that would rip the guts out of too many communities. That is why we know this will be some kind of compromise between the parties.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">It is very important that the government finds the money for the engineering works that can release water to the environment without damaging the communities down the river. That is something that I and the coalition have maintained ever since John Howard first announced the Murray-Darling rescue packages. It has been the long plan of the coalition to go down this path. We should continue to go down this path and we should continue to find the way that causes the least damage to the irrigation communities the length of the River Murray.</span>

                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Kennedy</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">19:43</span>):  I rise to speak on the Water Amendment (Long-Term Average Sustainable Diversion Limit Adjustment) Bill 2012. Once again, I find myself in a minority of one in this place. As the writer of a history book—we have sold 16,500 copies at $35; available at all good newsagencies—I can speak with some degree of pride about my country. Amongst its many great achievements I think the Snow Mountains Scheme was probably our greatest achievement. People with vision and determination—people like Minister Lemmon and Ben Chifley and the Liberal David Fairbairn—were very much a part of driving this idea. They could think big; they could see big. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Let us have a look at what this achieved. Half or maybe as much as 60 per cent of Australia's agricultural production comes from the Murray-Darling. The vast bulk of that comes from irrigation. Eight million mega litres are taken out of the 22 mega litres and used for irrigation purposes.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The people that ask for more water down the river are the greenies and people that want to go back to nature who do not believe we need any food. I, at one big debate, said there are 2,000 million people going to bed hungry of a night and there are going to be a hell of a lot more going to bed hungry of a night if we close down the Murray-Darling. They said we have got too many people. I said that is an interesting way of fixing it up; we starve them to death to get rid of that excess number of people. I had not thought of that idea before. But these people were not people with a sense of humour and none of them laughed. Ian Causley—one of the finest members of parliament I have served with in this place and a very successful minister for water, lands and agriculture in the New South Wales government—said 'when it rains the river runs and when it doesn't it doesn't'. Really, for those of us that live on these rivers, we know that is profoundly true. You can build all that dams and do everything you like and take backward somersaults at yourself but when it rains it runs and when it does not it does not.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">For those people that want to say this is a problem, all right you address the problem by looking at—and I pay tribute to Pat Byrnes at the National Civic Council—the idea of environmental dams. If you want to get back to nature then you return the Menindee Lakes and the Lake Alexandrina to their natural state, which is no water in them. That saves nearly a million mega litres of evaporation a year from the Menindee Lakes—artificial lakes created by and for what purposes we are not entirely sure—and Lake Alexandrina, which seems to me to be entirely stupid since Lake Alexandrina is only a stone's throw from the sea. If you want to see a huge body of water, head 20 or 30 kilometres south and you can see the ocean; that will make you happy. But do not take a million mega litres out of the Murray-Darling.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The Clarence River diversion put up by Mr Coffey and his firm, Coffey and Partners, is a magnificent scheme. It is one of those ideas whose time should have come. To protect the waters and people that live in the Clarence River basin from the huge flooding that occurs in that river and to capture a little bit of the flood water and send it back through the range, take a little bit of water from the Clarence but put a huge amount of water into the Murray-Darling.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The recycling of water is a very simple thing. Simply taking the water from your washing and putting it into your septic or sewerage water is a very simple thing to do yet it halves—arguably more than halves—the consumption of water in the ordinary household. In Brisbane the stupid Labor government or the stupid Liberal government—I cannot remember which—banned the use of water tanks and then made them compulsory 10 years later. So there are a dozen ways in which you can approach this problem if in fact there is a problem. I need a lot more convincing. I remain the only member of parliament that has gone to all of the seminars on the Murray-Darling Basin in this place. I like to think that as a patriotic Australian and a thinking Australian I should have a good handle on it.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Please God, in my lifetime may some government in this place might be enlightened enough to do something about the waters of northern Australia. The northern third of Australia has three quarters of the nation's water. And none of that is being used except a couple of tiny little dams. Virtually not a single drop of it is being used. I take great pleasure in advising the House that my political party, as small as it is, is diametrically opposed to any further cutbacks in the Murray-Darling and wants a restoration.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I will be doing a tour through the back of New South Wales very shortly and I will be telling the people in each town that you are going to be a ghost town because half of your entire income is going to vanish. The stupid people in the white house in Canberra have taken away three million mega litres of your eight million mega litres. They have taken it away and you will not get it back unless you start thinking about voting for a party that believes that we should be bigger nation than we are, that we should have a bigger economy and that we should have the great vision of our forefathers that drought proofed one tenth of the this nation with that magnificent scheme.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">When Strzelecki discovered Mount Kosciusko, he said he would name it after Kosciusko because Kosciusko was a man whose life was devoted to freedom and this is a freedom-loving country. He went on to say that the waters of the Snowy Mountains can change Australia and are one of the few undeveloped water resources left in the world that can achieve great things for a nation. I wish Strzelecki, the great Australian that he was, had come to North Queensland. We would have changed his attitude a bit on that one. This mighty scheme took was what was effectively a dustbowl of the lower Murray and the upper Darling and the Murrumbidgee and turned that dustbowl into a productive resource that feeds arguably 40 million people, most certainly over 20 million people. They turned it into a magnificent scheme that provides even today a 10th of our peak load power. Once again, the disgraceful people in this place tried to sell the greatest asset owned by the Australian people. They voted to sell it.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">So we will do everything within our power, the little party that we are, to try and stop any further cutbacks and to return that water. And if there is a problem out there, then there are a dozen ways of solving it. We will get off our backsides and solve those problems, and put more water down, if you want more water down—not a great problem; not a great problem at all.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Once again, I finally return to the greatest builder in Australian history by a long way, Dr John Crew Bradfield, who built the Sydney Harbour Bridge, the Story Bridge, the University of Queensland, and the Sydney underground railway system, for which he got the international award for engineering for that year and should have got it, quite frankly, for that decade. Today we still use the underground railway system in Sydney; it is a strategic part of our traffic flows in Sydney, as is that bridge. What great foresight! What great vision!</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This man said, 'If you fill up Lake Eyre you will have a hell of a lot of evaporation,' and I will be very technical: you will get over 30 million megalitres of evaporation a year. Remember that the Murray-Darling only has 22 million megalitres; you would get 30 million megalitres of evaporation, and it would be blown over the top of the Murray-Darling Basin.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The inquiry at the time, back in the thirties, said it would not work. It was a three-man committee, but the only one who knew what he was talking about was the meteorologist and he said that it would work. He was the only person on that committee who was technically qualified.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">If you say, 'It won't work and it's not going to cause rain over the Murray-Darling,' then where is the 30 million megalitres going to go? Is it going to jump over the Great Dividing Range and set off into the Pacific Ocean? Is it going to go backwards? Is it going to go up into the atmosphere and cause carbon dioxide problems? No. I simply think that, like all water that goes into the atmosphere, it will precipitate when it runs up against a mountain range; that mountain range is the Great Dividing Range, and it would be blown up against that.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I must also say that the scheme of that great man, Bradfield, centred upon two possibilities, One, which of course we would do today, is simply to dig a canal up from Spencer Gulf and fill Lake Eyre with water, which is well below sea level. Alternatively, you could take a little tiny proportion of the massive floodwaters of North Queensland—but I do not think we would send that all the way down to Lake Eyre; I think we would use that on the black soil plains of Queensland. I think that is a much better idea than to fill Lake Eyre.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">People say these ideas are ridiculous. Well, during the Great Depression in the United States they built the Tennessee Valley Authority which then produced more electricity than we produce in the whole of Australia put together—free, forever. They built a huge water highway, a channel through the Mississippi River; it went up 1,000 kilometres. It was navigable by quite big boats, actually. And of course they flood-proofed a lot of America as well. They also created the great agricultural juggernaut of the world, the United States' agricultural production. They did all of those wonderful things. Well, our forebears did too. But in this place today we are closing down what our forebears did. The pygmies are at it again! And on that note, I conclude.</span>

                    <a href="DYW" type="MemberSpeech">
                      <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Mr BURKE</span>
                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Watson</span>—<span class="HPS-MinisterialTitles">Minister for Sustainability, Environment, Water, Population and Communities</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">19:55</span>):  I thank all contributors who have been involved in this debate. I should, in summing up, first of all explain the process from here, because a lot of people, with the different bills and the different parts of Murray-Darling reform, have been asking, 'What are the different votes that will come to the parliament?'</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The vote that we take this evening is about the structure that a Basin Plan is allowed to have. It deals specifically with the codification of what is being referred to as a mechanism. Effectively, it is a way of saying that the recommended number—which, at the moment, we have seen is 2,750—has economic, environmental and social consequences; for each of those three, you cannot take backward steps, but if you can improve one of the three without hurting the others, the mechanism allows you to do so. There are some processes and some formality built into that in the bill that is before us. And that is the only decision that is effectively being taken tonight.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I will be introducing another bill which will explain how the government intends to interact with that mechanism. That will be the moment when the parliament has an opportunity to discuss the announcements that were made by the Prime Minister and the Premier of South Australia last week.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The third issue will be when I sign off on the Murray-Darling Basin plan. If anyone moves disallowance then that disallowance motion will also be before the parliament. I will not be in a position to do so until the bill before us now has been carried by both houses, because it actually underpins some of the structural aspects that would be contained within that plan. So either two or three of what I have just described will find their way through, to be in front of us in this parliament for the remaining sitting period.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">To return to the bill in front of us, I thank everyone for their contribution to the debate. I acknowledge that there has been a strong and consistent refrain from the opposition on ministerial prerogative. I want to make clear both why that is not the government's position and why, when we get to the in-detail section, the government will be willing to look at a compromise proposal which has been negotiated effectively, as I understand it, with the opposition.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">In the first instance, the argument that the opposition have been putting has been that it should not be an independent authority on its own; the decision should then fall back to the minister to approve or reject what the authority has recommended. Part of the reason that Prime Minister Howard and the then minister for water, the member for Wentworth, designed the Murray-Darling Basin Authority and the Water Act the way they did was to take the decision out of the hands of politicians, and that is our preference. For that reason I am reluctant to have processes which whack the decisions back into the hands of politicians after a plan and a structure have already been put in place. I do not believe it is the ideal way to go with policy. However, I do appreciate that the structure of how a mechanism can work is something that should have, in structural terms, a workability that is acceptable to both sides of the parliament.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">With that in mind, while I understand that there is an amendment from the opposition already on the <span style="font-style:italic;">Notice Paper </span>that deals with the ministerial prerogative part of it, I indicate now before we move to that stage of the debate the government has an amendment that incorporates all the aspects of the opposition amendments but adds a part that says that if that ministerial prerogative is exercised then any amendments that the minister puts through would be disallowable. We will deal with that when it comes. Given that our amendment incorporates all aspects of the opposition amendment, it is important to put on the record the context, which is that the government has arrived at this on the basis of the different contributions that have been made by the opposition in the course of this debate. It is not our preferred course of action. But we believe that the compromise that it offers will provide a way through. I commend the bill to the House.</span>

The bad part of this bill was that it removed ministerial, and potentially parliamentary, scrutiny from the Basin Plan. That scrutiny did exist, contrary to what the minister said, under section 44(3), which gave the minister a power to act. That is now being effectively retained and we have put that forward and the government has adopted it. We are happy that the parliament is now sovereign again.</span>

                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Hume</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">20:41</span>):  In continuation of my short contribution last night, let me begin by repeating the last paragraph. In Western Australia, as an example, they have the unique, very successful industry process whereby the growers actually have a cooperative that looks after the wheat exporters. Western Australians own their own bulk-handling authority. By all accounts it is Australia's most effective and, apparently, cost-efficient system. It is in stark contrast to what applies in New South Wales, where there is indeed a serious monopoly called GrainCorp. The monopoly called GrainCorp originated through a decision by the Greiner-Murray government in the early 1990s to sell off the government owned Grain Corp to private enterprise. Hence the birth of the problems associated with monopoly handling of a particular system. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">One of the problems that we have about this whole system is that it is very evident that we cannot come up with a system that is going to please everybody because of the geographic isolation and the infrastructure differences on a state-by-state basis. The object of the federal parliament is not to come out with a piece of legislation that pleases and/or appeases individual groups. It has to come up with a decision that is constructively centred on the interests of the people in the industry itself. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This particular bill is of great personal significance and interest to me. As I said yesterday, I made a couple of pretty comprehensive speeches on the issue of the corrupt AWB Ltd and what it was doing to export wheat growers in Western Australia and how certain A and B class shareholders of AWB Pty Ltd, who happened to be eastern wheat growers, were ripping off the Western Australian growers to buy $40 to $60 per tonne and in total $360 million a year, which was being used by AWB as a dividend base for A and B shareholders. I could not live with that or with anyone in any industry ripping off their partners in the same industry. I did not think that was appropriate.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I copped a bit of flak on this issue, as did the former member for O'Connor, Wilson Tuckey, when we pressed the then Howard government to do away with the AWB. One of the most vocal people was a fellow by the name of Jock Munro, of Rankin Springs in the member for Riverina's electorate. I note that the member for Riverina mentions him in glowing terms, but what he does not know about him, because he was not here at that time, was that he came into this parliament and tried to intimidate people. Fortunately he missed me, but he went up to the member for Farrer's office. I got a phone call from her after he had been there; she was very distraught because this bloke had threatened to destroy her politically. My reaction to that was: 'Susan, get on the phone. Here is the phone number for you. Ring up the Federal Police. He is in contravention of the Crimes Act and he should be charged.' That is the sort of person I have been dealing with on this issue for some time now. Anybody who thinks a bloke like that is all right really wants to have a look at themselves—I will say no more than that.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Madam Deputy Speaker, I will take this opportunity to acquaint you and the parliament with the history behind my original comments on this issue, which have been the subject of further discussions with thinking, reasonable people, including politicians and constituent wheat growers. The precursor to the problem with what is now described as a monopoly by GrainCorp in New South Wales, as I mentioned earlier, was the National Party agreement within the Greiner-Murray government to regulate the wheat industry in New South Wales by privatising GrainCorp. What we are living with today is the further deregulation of the export wheat market through an amendment to the 2008 wheat export marketing bill, which followed the former Howard-Anderson government's decision to shut down the embarrassingly corrupt AWB much to the disdain of A- and B-class shareholders who were reaping guaranteed share dividends which, as I said previously, were financed from costs and charges which AWB, under the single-desk process, were ripping off from export wheat growers who were predominantly South Australian and Western Australian wheat growers. I thought that was about as low as you can get: wheat growers living off interstate export wheat growers in the way of dividends resulting in reduced returns to those export wheat growers of $40 to $60 a tonne.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The idea of re-establishing a single desk for wheat marketing will not solve the current problem because you cannot have a one-size-fits-all approach when there are unique geographical and infrastructure differences on a state-by-state basis. I recognise that there are indeed problems with the east coast grain supply chain, but returning to anything which remotely mirrors the former single-desk system is not the answer—and that is what my concerns have been about. I am advised by clear-thinking farmers that they believe single desks or farmer owned cooperatives make sense when farmers face downstream monopolists. They reinforce the reality that wheat marketing is a highly competitive business with relatively small margins. They are adamant that the real monopoly is with rail, grain handling and ports infrastructure, where east coast growers have limited options outside of GrainCorp. They also say growers need to look at greater options for getting wheat to markets on the east coast and that reinvesting in the grain rail system and encouraging private operators—like Newcastle agri-terminal, which is run by Jock Carter from Goulburn in New South Wales—is the answer. The strong message I received was that growers need to focus on the right issue—their words, not mine—and not get distracted by some outmoded idea that the marketing of grain, as against its handling and transportation, is the problem.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">National Farmers Federation President Jock Laurie met with 50 parliamentarians recently—and I might add that the parliamentarians came together because of a discussion between my colleague over there on the other side of the House and a wonderful individual on this side of the House, Nola Marino, a fine Western Australian dairy farmer. I would like to quote Jock Laurie's words at that meeting:</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">I think it is important that all people who actually support agriculture are prepared to stand up and support it on principle rather than on some of the party political stuff that goes on, because I really think that does a fair bit of damage to the debate out in regional areas.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">He conceded that some of the blame for poor policy outcomes rested with farmers and farm groups across Australia who were really bad at working from a unified position. He also said that the wheat export debate was a very good example of an issue that had blown out due to different lobby groups presenting different views to Canberra. He said:</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">The biggest trouble with the grains industry is they do not have a united voice.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I make the point that there is no solution that can be delivered in the federal parliament that will satisfy individual states or farmers and the parliament cannot differentiate to please or appease, as I said previously. It is my personal opinion that the logical level of government to address this economy is the states, which have the powers necessary, including price-fixing, total acquisition, fair trading and the office of the ombudsman. In the meantime I just want to send a very, very stark message that I will not be influenced by the backdoor antics of the New South Wales Farmers Association. They have put out a standard letter to their members, asking them to write to me. I have answered each and every one of those letters—and I might add that there were only seven in total. Nor will I be influenced by personal cowardly abuse by National Party members or vested interests. I will make my decision on the basis of a fair and equitable resolution for growers of export wheat. It is, after all, an amendment to the 2012 export wheat marketing bill that I will be voting on.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The export wheat marketing bill that was introduced by the Labor Party in 2008, before many of my current colleagues in this place were here, was a revamped version of a similar bill that was going to be introduced by the Howard government for the very reasons that I outlined before: to clean the industry up and get the corruption out of the system. Sadly from my point of view—and nobody though about this—from 2000 to 2008, when farmer organisations around the whole country should have been getting together and working out a system that would satisfy all of the states, with their different infrastructure and geographical problems, nothing happened. It was only when the government of the day decided that it would move down the path of further deregulation and brought in this amendment bill that people started to sit up and take notice and suddenly realised that they had not sorted out what the Wheat Export Authority was put in charge to do—and that was to come to a consensus of opinion between all the different groups and all the farmer bodies across the country to come up with something that controlled the very issues that are of concern to growers.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">That saddens me, because we are now going down the path where people are excited for various reasons about the further deregulation. Further deregulation can be undertaken if it is allowed now to go down the path of a two-year delay—that is, no further action done until 2014 to allow the Wheat Export Authority and the farmer groups to get together to come up with a solution that is going to be acceptable to everybody. At the same time that that is happening, it is incumbent upon the farming groups to get to the state governments of the day and talk to them about why they cannot come up with some sort of legislative process through the ombudsman—and, indeed their ownership of the infrastructure that carries a lot of this wheat—and put a restriction on the people that are leasing that infrastructure to the extent where there is some control on stopping them from using that infrastructure as a monopoly to hit people with costs and charges of up to $52 a tonne in an environment where they are carting coal, as an example, under the same system for $18 a tonne. You cannot do that to people. You cannot do that to producers. I understand their concerns about that issue, but the producers have an obligation with their farmer bodies to get together and fix this up now.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">It is because of the conversations that I have had with people and assurances I have been given by both the Leader of the Nationals and the Leader of the Liberal Party on this side of the parliament that I will be supporting the coalition on this bill, as distinct from what I was talking about a week or so ago. </span>

                      <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Mr ADAMS</span>
                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Lyons</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">20:54</span>):  Thank you to the honourable member for Hume, who just spoke, who I work with on committees in this parliament. He is somebody who has a strong view about this. I see his honesty in   where he has come from to reach his position on the Wheat Export Marketing Amendment Bill. This bill implements the Australian government's response to the Productivity Commission's review of wheat exporting marketing arrangements, which was also considered under the House of Representatives standing committee on Agriculture, Resources, Fisheries and Forestry.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">In June this year that committee made a number of recommendations to be included in the bill. The Productivity Commission review was done early on because the coalition insisted that this clause be included in the Wheat Export Marketing Amendment Bill 2008. So there had to be a Productivity Commission review early in the process. The government had argued for this to be conducted at a later stage. The committee was aware that the current supply chain infrastructure is divided into regional monopolies developed through historical circumstances. However, delaying deregulation would not necessarily improve these trading conditions. Indeed, probably the entrance of new players into the market may be aided by deregulation and the abolition of accreditation.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">In relation to market information, the committee agreed with the evidence that information relating to wheat stocks should be improved and freely available. A number of submissions and witnesses explained that wheat stock information currently available would be insufficient for a deregulated wheat market to function properly. I would have thought that industry would have wanted to make this information as freely available as possible. The committee, therefore, on this occasion recommended that the industry funded entity be developed to deliver services to the industry in the areas of quality, standards and stock information, and that the government consider appointing an industry funded grain industry ombudsman for a five-year period.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The industry should manage quality, and in fact the current laws reflect this situation. I would think that the customer would let you know what he wanted. If it was not up to the standard, the miller might say, 'I don't think it's what I want. You'd better give me what I want, otherwise I won't buy it off you.' The ombudsman, as we recommended, would be paid for by industry, by those that needed to use an ombudsman if there was a dispute. There are several models in Australia along these lines. Also, the committee recommended that the government support improving the sharing of wheat stock information and that this process might be initiated through using funds from the Wheat Industry Special Account.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The transition to a fully deregulated bulk wheat export market began on 1 July 2008 with the abolition of the single-desk wheat marketing arrangements. The decision to abolish the WEA was taken, of course, after consultation with all industry sectors, including development of the Wheat Export Marketing Amendment Act 2008 and the Productivity Commission review. There has been no task force dominated by large grain marketers. The Wheat Export Marketing Amendment Act 2008 established a scheme for regulating the export of bulk wheat where exporters of bulk wheat must be accredited under the Wheat Export Accreditation Scheme, called the scheme, administered by Wheat Exports Australia and primarily funded from the wheat export charge. The Productivity Commission report on its inquiry into the wheat export marketing arrangements was tabled in parliament on 28 October 2010. This bill will implement the commission's recommendations relating to the act, but under a staged approach to ensure that full benefits of the 2008 reforms are released. It will abolish the scheme and the WEC on 30 December 2012 and wind up the WEA on 31 December 2012. This will give the WEA time to complete outstanding tasks, such as the final annual report and the 2012-13 report for growers.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The requirement for providers of grain port terminal services to pass the access test as a condition for exporting bulk wheat will be retained until 30 September 2014. This is a bit of a contentious issue. The access test will then be abolished, on the condition that a non-prescribed voluntary industry code of conduct covering access to grain export terminals is in place. That code will apply so that people cannot use their monopoly position to take advantage of market situations. If such a code is approved, the market will move to full deregulation from 1 October 2014. All aspects of the industry will be subject to general competition law administered by the Australian Competition and Consumer Commission, the ACCC, and complemented by the code. If a code is not approved, the access test will continue.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The Code Development Committee is making good progress on port access issues. It is conscious of the need for a strong compliance mechanism, which will be a key element in the government's consideration of whether the code is of an acceptable standard. It has also reached in-principle agreement on the release of increased stocks information. It should be noted that not all growers want stocks information made public, particularly those in WA.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This bill will bring the bulk wheat export market into line with other agricultural commodity markets and promote further competition in the wheat industry, leading to increased productivity and profitability. It will mean that more buyers will be competing for wheat, helping growers to get prices that reflect market value. The bill is expected to drive further marketing innovation and improve the services that marketers provide to secure supplies of wheat. It is expected that the industry will also benefit from the removal of the costs associated with bulk wheat export market regulation.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This is obviously the future of the sale of wheat from Australia. We need to ask ourselves why this bill is necessary. People might remember the scandal in 2007, when the Australian Wheat Board was illegally selling wheat to the Middle East. An article in the <span style="font-style:italic;">Australian</span> in November 2011 states:</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">However, it was revealed in the same article that not all farmers are of the same mind. It says the 'hankering for the glory days of the wheat board monopoly, when it had sole rights to sell Australia's $6 billion a year wheat crop on the global markets' is not shared by some of the younger, progressive farmers, who believe in the merits of trading wheat independently. If you talk to some of them, they will certainly tell you that. The article points out that some of these younger farmers, who were 'privately selling grains such as barley, canola and lupins 15 years ago, long before the wheat board was abolished' enjoy 'the sense that after delivering harvested grain to nearby depots' they can optimise their returns by choices made later on their computer. So modern farmers are using modern technology in a modern world.</span>

                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The Wheat Export Marketing Amendment Bill 2012 requires the ACCC to monitor continuous disclosure rules—contradicting Mr Cobb's statement that the eyes of the WEA will be gone. The ACCC will become the eyes to make sure that nothing wrong is occurring. It only demonstrates what a lack of leadership there is in the opposition on rural sector issues. There have been massive changes in the last few years. We should not be going back to the old Wheat Board days; we should be looking forward. But that is not occurring in this parliament. We are looking at old ways and going backwards instead of forwards with that sort of leadership in rural Australia. It is disappointing for young people like the member for Wannon over on other side. I know his concern about what is occurring in his own party room. I know that he wants to have a free marketing process because that is the way forward.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I think the miller of wheat should decide whether the wheat quality meets their needs, whether it is to make noodles, pastry, Weet-Bix, flat bread or high loaves. The industry needs to work this matter out. Along with the changes that this bill assists, we should have a website to highlight what wheat is available to sell. The industry should be able to work those things out in a modern way, as do many other industries in today's world. The wheat available would be there on the website for people to see. I do not see what could make people think that you could not modernise this industry. This could give a better indication to farmers as to what wheat to grow, helping them to choose by seeing what people want to buy. If the quality is there and it meets the needs of the millers, there are more opportunities to look for new uses and new products.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">As with many other agricultural products, there needs to be research and development in this industry so that a strong future can be mapped out for wheat and other cereals. We need to be on top of the health issues in terms of the effect of food products, especially in assisting allergies by developing alternatives.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Why are the opposition trying to make it harder to market Australian wheat? We need to ensure that we can always be on the cutting edge: looking for new markets, taking on changes, considering the latest in research and looking for other cereals that can complement what we already grow.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">So this bill will complement the many changes and innovations being made in the agricultural industry generally by this government—not with the opposition. I think it is important to allow competition to be part of the process, which means we can be in front of Europe and the United States in opening up our markets to new ideas and new technology without being at the behest and control of the some of the subsidies operating around the world.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I have seen that wheat grain exports in August this year totalled 2.2 million tonnes, or 59 per cent more than in August last year. I know that we have had a good year but I think it is happening—we seem to be out there selling more wheat and servicing more markets and more customers within each market. It seems to be happening; since the wheat board has gone we have diversified where we are selling wheat. We are selling more wheat, therefore our producers will need to grow more wheat and we will need to know what we need.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The discerning Asian market has grown. Here is the opportunity. We have been talking about the Asian century and the opportunity to sell grain. I was in Korea with the trade committee not long ago. I was in a bakery where the guy wanted to buy organic wheat from Australia because he only sells organic products. It is a very modern bakery which has a French sort of theme selling lots and lots of pastries. So I think the opportunities are there but we have to be able to capture them, and we should be able to capture the new markets. I support the bill.</span>

                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">
                    <a href="210911" type="MemberSpeech">
                      <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Mr TEHAN</span>
                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Wannon</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">21:09</span>):  I rise tonight to speak on the Wheat Export Marketing Amendment Bill and the amendment. It is a great honour to speak after the member for Lyons, because, along with the member for Lyons, the House of Representatives Standing Committee on Agriculture, Resources, Fisheries and Forestry undertook an inquiry into this bill. I commend the member for Lyons on the way he steered the committee in getting to its final report, because the final report that was put out the by House committee addresses the issues that are still before us tonight as we debate this bill. It is one of the great pities that work has not been done to fix the issues which we identified in this bill before we had to come here and debate this bill, because if the executive had listened to the committee, which was chaired by the member for Lyons, and had read this House report and done its work, I think we would all be here saying that cooperatively we will move forward in the best interests of the Australian wheat industry. Unfortunately, that has not happened to date.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">So, we are here debating this bill while the issue of port access arrangements, the issue of transparency standards in relation to stock information, and issues to do with minimum quality standards are still up for discussion—while there is still debate and negotiation going on over the voluntary code which underpins the future of the industry.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">It is a real shame that the minister has not done the work required. So, rather than us being in a situation where it seems that the government wants to play politics with this bill, we could actually do what is in the best interests of the Australian wheat industry. And the Australian wheat industry is very important to our nation. The evidence that we took during our House committee inquiry demonstrated that. And the future is bright for the Australian wheat industry. The evidence we took also demonstrated that. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The forecasts that we were given by ABARES show that Australian production of wheat between 2012-13 and 2016-17 will be about 26 million tonnes. And wheat exports are projected to be at about 20 million tonnes, up to 2017-17. This is providing substantial export income for this nation. It is a serious industry and the government should give it the service and the attention that it deserves. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">So what has been done around the issues, identified by industry, that they want sorted out before full deregulation takes place? I just want to get on the record quite clearly that all members on this side of the House support deregulation. This parliament took the first step—basically the most important step and the significant step—to make sure that we had a deregulated wheat industry, when it abolished the single desk. What we are talking about here is making sure that in taking the final step we have the future of the industry at heart and that we set the direction for the industry along the right path into the future. Sadly, at the moment we are not there. That is why it surprises me that we are here debating this bill tonight. We should have had these issues sorted out before this bill was brought before this place.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">What is the process currently being undertaken by the industry to try and get to the stage where they can move to that last step towards deregulation? They are trying to sort out port access arrangements to make sure that the old legacy issues—some of them monopolistic—that have been left through deregulation can be dealt with going forward. And the idea is that we would get a voluntary code which would deal with this. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">But the issue is that the voluntary code has no teeth. There is nothing which requires the players who come together as part of that voluntary code to stay as participants. What is to stop them, come September 2014 or 1 October 2014, from walking away from it? There is no certainty there for players in the process. And there does not seem to be an indication of how that problem can be alleviated.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">There is also the issue with stock information. Once again, a House Standing Committee on Agriculture, Resources, Fisheries and Forestry inquiry took submissions on this issue. Some of the submissions were quite compelling. The acid test on this issue is whether you can have a proper functioning futures market with the amount of stocks information that is available in this country. According to the ASX, at the moment you cannot. So let us not hear from the other side this rhetoric about protectionism going backwards. What we are looking to do is make sure as we go forward that we have the proper structures in place to make sure that a deregulated wheat industry can operate how it should operate. One of the keys to a proper deregulated wheat industry taking place and operating efficiently is a proper functioning futures market which growers can participate in with certainty and with knowledge so that they can hedge along with other players in the industry like they already do. We need in Australia a proper functioning wheat futures market so we are not reliant on what is happening in the US futures market. We need to control our own destiny so that our wheat growers know with certainty that they can operate on a futures market here in Australia. They would not have to worry about all the issues around currency hedging, which they also have to take into consideration if they go to Chicago or elsewhere. What we need is the certainty for them here to control their own destiny.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Quality standards was another concern raised by industry. Ultimately we have the final arbiter and that is the overseas market. If you send poor quality wheat overseas then the person buying that wheat eventually is going to say, 'You are not delivering the quality or the standards we require; therefore, we are not going to buy from you.' That is the final backstop to this issue. There is the market to deal with this issue. But the problem is if you get a couple of shipments rejected then, because of the bulk wheat that we export, it does have the potential to hurt the industry as a whole. What industry wants to do is have the opportunity to come up with a way where it can ensure that there are some controls around basic minimum standards—not a request which is unreasonable or unfair.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">What has the government said to industry players when they have detailed quite specifically that these are the concerns in taking the next step down the deregulation path? They have been given no assurances. They have been given no undertakings. They have not had any of the future direction of the industry or where the government sees this industry going mapped out. They have had no assurances whatsoever. The minister needs to take leadership on this front. It might be that what the minister needs to do in taking this leadership position is say to industry, 'I want to empower you to come up with the solutions yourself.' That would be a very good way forward.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">It has to be said that there are divergent views within the industry. There are divergent views in Western Australia and in South Australia where the bulk of our wheat is exported from and along the eastern seaboard where the majority of our domestic wheat is grown and sold. There are issues of fairness and transparency that need to be worked out as we go forward. We have had full deregulation in the domestic wheat industry and we have seen that that has been successful. In moving to make sure that we get to full deregulation on the export side, maybe we need to look and ask: have we got the balance right? It requires the minister to say to the industry, 'I have confidence in you being able to work this out, being able to show us the way forward. I want to empower you. I want to treat you with the respect that you deserve because you are an industry which is incredibly important to our export performance.'</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Our exports of wheat to Indonesia are incredibly important. It is a part of us supplying the growing middle-class of Asia. We talk about the Asian white paper. We did not see a lot of detail around food processing, around agriculture or around what the government is doing to make sure that linkages into this growth market will continue to grow and develop. Will we get the sort of cooperation that we need to ensure value is added to the food chain along the export path? This is the sort of thing that industry players want to see from the government. More importantly, they want to see that the government has the confidence in them to come up with some solutions to their issues. It might be that they need and they want their own body to help them along this path and maybe they want to fund that themselves.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Previous governments have taken the deregulation path with AWI, with MLA, with Dairy Australia, and done it quite successfully. If you look at the dairy industry, the way the coalition went about deregulating the dairy industry and setting up Dairy Australia, it gives an example to the minister of the type of leadership which he needs to show on this issue.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">So, rather than playing politics with it, read the House report, Minister. See the issues that are identified. The chair was happy to sign off on identifying those issues and say that they need to be fixed. Yet all we are hearing from the executive is silence on this issue.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Those in the industry are calling for leadership. They understand that they need to go down the deregulatory path. They understand that. But what they want is some surety from government that, in going down that path, the government is prepared to stick with them, work with them, and make sure that the path is as smooth as possible—not something which is too contentious; not something which has not been done before. It is something that the minister seriously needs to look at, because if he sits down with the industry and tries to work things out, a path forward can be found because the issues have been identified. What we need now is the time and effort put in to finding the solution. If that can be found—and industry says, 'We are confident it can be found'—then I am sure all sides of this House will get behind this bill and say, 'Yes, this is the path we want to go down.' But putting the cart before the horse and asking us all to take a leap of faith is placing us in an untenable position. So let us step back from that and see if we can work cooperatively to get the solution that we need.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This industry is too important to play politics with. It is one of our key agricultural export sectors. It is one of the keys to ensuring that we will feed that Asian middle class which has been identified ad nauseam by those on the other side. But let us start seeing some substance put behind the theory on the other side. Let us see them work, sit down and do the hard yards, to make sure that the industry knows what its future is and is confident about its future. The Australian wheat industry is too important for us not to do that.</span>

                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Murray</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">21:24</span>):  I, too, wish to speak on the Wheat Export Marketing Amendment Bill 2012. You would think, from the way this government has behaved in relation to this most important agribusiness in Australia, that they have no experience whatsoever of managing an export enterprise and that they just simply do not understand what can in Australia very easily become a monopoly situation. We sometimes imagine that it was the mining sector that rescued Australia from the global financial crisis. It was not; it was the fact that more wheat was being traded out of the country because it had rained over various parts of the wheat-growing belts of eastern and western Australia.</span>
                </p>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Wheat is a commodity. Some people do not quite understand what that means. It means that the importers of the product in Korea, Japan and the Middle East are absolutely dependent on the specification which they have identified for delivery. That specification includes such things as the protein levels, the moisture levels, any chemical residue levels, and things like trash. They need to have the volume, precisely, and the variety that they have ordered sometimes a season in advance. That is because the product that they manufacture out of our wheat has to be consistent if they want to deliver a high-value, high-quality, branded product into their market.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">When it comes to Japan, their noodle products are icon foods. They are even more important to the Koreans. The Japanese and Koreans together regard their noodles as their icon foods—more important than the quality of bread to France, I would suggest. They have depended on Australian noodle wheats now for at least some 25 years.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I was most concerned, when I was in Korea and Japan in the last two months, and asked them about our wheat. These were the big importers of our wheat, the manufacturers, the millers, who put into the market high-value fresh noodles. I asked them: 'How is our wheat going? Are you still quite happy with the product that you are receiving?' And these big buyers said to me: 'Well, we are concerned. We have no longer got the guaranteed specification that we had come to pay a high price for and that we had come to value, above, say, the Canadian product or the American product or products from countries in Europe. We are finding now it is a bit of touch and go. We are not getting the absolutely guaranteed, down to the finest decimal point, specification that we used to order and receive season after season. And we are not receiving,' they were telling me, 'the sort of market information that we used to receive from the single desk, which told us in advance, if there was a problem with drought in Western Australia, that there would have to be a blending of some product from the eastern side and that the specification would need to be a little varied.' They once received notice about that so that they could make adjustments to their other ingredients and still produce, at the end of the day, a manufactured product that was consistent and something they could be proud of.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I am not saying that it is just because we lost the single desk that we are now beginning to lose the strong reputation for Australian wheat in our premier markets. I am suggesting that we have had such a frenzy of exporting occur since we had so-called deregulation of the market that there has not been the attention to quality assurance that needs to happen if the reputation of Australia's wheat is to be retained. And I am sorry to say it but it is a fact that once a nation's reputation for quality is damaged it takes a long while to get it back.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I was never surprised when the United States Wheat Associates or the Canadian Wheat Board were desperate to have our situation of pre-eminent reputation in Australia damaged. They would, year after year, say things like, 'You can't be sure about Australia; it's always drought or flood.' In fact, for a very long time we had a pre-eminent position in the world as delivering as per specification.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">What we have to do now is to make sure that this government understands that it is not a baby-and-bathwater situation. You cannot allow Rafferty's rules to reign if you want to still have a wheat commodity that has a reputation for excellence and for being delivered as per specification. That does require some oversight.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This requires more than a voluntary code, I have to say. Unfortunately, the Gillard government, with so little experience in the real world of business and certainly no experience in agribusiness, is trying to abolish the last remnant of any sort of quality assurance and oversight. They seem to think that standing back and seeing what happens will do. It will not do. That is why we have a proposed amendment to the Wheat Export Marketing Amendment Bill 2012. Our amendments says, 'Give us time; give the industry time; give the wheat export marketing framework a little more time so some quality assurance and oversight can be sorted out.'</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">
                  <a href="M2V" type="MemberSpeech">
                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Mr MATHESON</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Macarthur</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">21:30</span>):  I would like to take this opportunity to commend a fantastic organisation in my electorate which provides early intervention programs for children living with a disability. KU Starting Points Macarthur is an education support program that has helped children with additional needs and their families in my electorate for the past 20 years. At present, the service supports more than 300 families in Macarthur through programs run at its centres in Airds and Camden.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">KU offers a range of early intervention programs for children with additional needs, as well as support for siblings through integrated play sessions and parents through practical advice, guidance and emotional support networks. The play based program has been designed to enhance the development of children living with a disability or developmental delays. KU also runs a transition to school program that is specifically designed to prepare children for preschool or school through a range of fun activities.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Local families who take part in the program are given access to professional support services including a dedicated speech pathologist, psychologist, childcare workers and teachers. The organisation also offers opportunities for families to connect with other families so they can share their experiences and knowledge in a safe and friendly environment. Social activities organised throughout the year are a great way for these families to connect and provide each other with a vital support network.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">In Macarthur, I spend lots of time with families who have children living with a disability. The children are beautiful kids with big hearts and big smiles and the parents are committed to giving their children a life that is full of hope, joy and endless possibilities. I am continuously inspired by their positive attitude and dedication to bring down barriers and raise awareness of their children's condition. But no matter how amazing these parents may be, raising a child with additional needs can be extremely challenging and isolating. KU Starting Points Macarthur has become a lifeline for these parents, offering advice, guidance and support for siblings and parents whilst their children participate in the intervention programs. Mum's from The Right Start, a group dedicated to giving children with Down syndrome the best start in life, are always praising KU and the support they are given by the organisation.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">But it is not just children with Down syndrome or autism who can access the services and support network at KU. Last year I spoke in parliament about Brittney McKenna, a young girl from my electorate who lived with spinal muscular atrophy and sadly passed away in 2008. In total, of the nine years of her life, Brittney spent more than five years in hospital. I cannot imagine how stressful this would have been for Brittney's family, who had no choice but to pass their son Liam between family and friends to give him any hope of a routine and a normal life. When Brittney was born, it was KU Starting Points who gave that initial support to her family and helped them to realise that they were not alone. After Brittney's death, her mum Debbie returned to KU Starting Points as a staff member to help other families doing it tough.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I am very proud to stand here today to thank a service that has supported families in my community for 20 years. Two decades of providing much-needed services for children with additional needs and their families is something that coordinator Larraine Brown and all of her staff and volunteers at KU should be very, very proud of. The thing I like most about this program is that the child's entire family is supported by a huge support network. This is why on Saturday I will attend the KU Starting Points 16th Annual Charity Auction at the Campbelltown Catholic Club, who have given them great support. The annual charity night is a very special event in my community. Local residents and businesses support the cause by donating money and auction items to help raise money. The parents who have received help from KU over the years also play a great part in the success of the fundraiser by calling on all their family, friends and contacts to support the cause with donations and to buy tickets for the evening.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The money raised this year will help KU to extend its building at Airds to include two new therapy rooms and more space to accommodate the increasing number of children in the program. It is a great cause that I am sure will continue to be supported by many people in my community. KU Starting Points is a fantastic example of the community spirit we have in Macarthur. While government funding and medical advancements will always be needed and welcomed by these families, it is the emotional support network that means so much to them.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I am proud to live in a community where people support each other through the good times and bad. KU Starting Points is a great example of this and one of the reasons why Macarthur is such a wonderful place to bring up a family. I commend the organisation for its great work in my community over the past 20 years. And I congratulate all of those parents in Macarthur who refuse to let their children be defined by a disability. Rather, they choose to focus on the bright future ahead and the endless possibilities in store for their beautiful kids. I am extremely proud of the way these parents and families support each other and I am continually amazed, but not surprised, by the way they rally the Macarthur community to support their wonderful cause. <span style="font-style:italic;">(Time expired)</span></span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">
                  <a href="HWA" type="MemberSpeech">
                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Ms RISHWORTH</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Kingston</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">21:35</span>):  Last week, I was delighted to attend Willunga High School, which was host to the opening of the Southern Adelaide and Fleurieu Trade School. This was opening of a cluster of trades training centres funded by this government. It was a wonderful occasion indeed. I was there to represent the Minister for School Education, Early Childhood and Youth. I was welcomed by a number of students there from a range of different schools in the region. They displayed some of their wares from the trades that they are learning.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The Southern Adelaide and Fleurieu Trade School received $9.5 million as part of round 2 of the trades training centres in schools money provided by this government. This money was very wisely used by a group of schools. The applicants for this money were a group of schools in my local electorate and the neighbouring electorate of Mayo. That group include Willunga High School, Hallett Cove School, Reynella East College, Wirreanda High School, Seaford 6-12 School, Mount Compass Area School, Victor Harbor High School and Yankalilla Area School. This group of schools got together and decided that, rather than duplicating trades training in the region, they would cooperate. They have been cooperating for many years in terms of trades training, sharing student experience and ensuring that those in the southern suburbs and the wider region get the opportunities that they deserve.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Indeed, the money that came from the trades training centre—the $9.5 million—could only better enable these schools to deliver a wide range of skills.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We know that academia is not for all students, but we also equally know that finishing a year 12 certificate is critically important for young people's future. If we are able to encourage young people to stay at school and also have an opportunity to experience a trade and get a certificate in that, it is vitally important.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">It was very concerning to me to read the statistic that a person leaving school before finishing year 11 will earn around 20 per cent below average earnings. That is quite significant, so ensuring that there is trades training available at our schools is critically important. And who better to do it than our schools, in collaboration with RTOs and other registered training organisations. It is so critical that we do deliver this to engage young people in the local area.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Some of the certificates being offered by these eight schools are: agriculture, horticulture, construction, automotive engineering, electro technology, hairdressing, hospitality, bricklaying, carpentry, cooking, motor mechanics, plumbing, general electrician, welding, plastering and tiling. I can imagine that many of us in this place could not dream of those types of opportunities when we went to school. But here in the southern suburbs of Adelaide, enabled by the trades training money provided by this government, we are seeing real opportunities for many young people.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I was so pleased to be there and celebrate all the hard work that was done by all the schools in the area. But I think it is important to note the collaboration between these schools, which is something that is quite unique, and many other regions can learn from it. They actually have their timetabling done so that they can move between schools to do the trade they are really interested in. I think that is very exciting.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">These schools were granted in round two, as was the trades training centre at Southern Vales Christian College. I was also pleased to have attended that in September. They have really gone for a focus in hospitality. Being in Aldinga there is a real connection between food and wine. They are just a step away from the McLaren Vale region, so they have really focused on delivering hospitality training. That was also very exciting.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">This program will continue, with money being delivered to Christies Beach High School. As these trades and certificates are rolled out I will be very pleased and I commend all those involved. <span style="font-style:italic;">(Time expired)</span></span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">
                  <a href="00AMU" type="MemberSpeech">
                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Mrs MIRABELLA</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Indi</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">21:40</span>):  This week the Prime Minister and her cohorts have been desperately begging us to talk about the infamous Asian Century White Paper. Adjournment debates are scheduled for five minutes, which provides more than enough time to comprehensively detail the merits of this paper. I have had a look at it, and let me say there is no shortage of grandiose statements, aspirations and plenty of catch Labor phrases like 'pathways', 'collaboration', ' regional and global value chains', ' pillars of productivity', 'sub pathways' and 'people-to-people engagement'. But I just want to list some of my favourites. The paper notes that:</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Small">A world-class school system is essential to Australia’s success in the Asian century.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Well, this is one of the grandest motherhood statements I have heard in my almost 11 years in this place! I would have thought that a world-class school system was essential to Australia's success in any century, be it an Asian century, a European century or an American century.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">But it gets better. The white paper also wants Australia to be one of the top 10 richest countries by 2025. Well, isn't that just fantastic! It is a great aspiration, and it is something we would all like to achieve, but for some reason I do not think that writing that statement in a glossy white paper is going to achieve that goal.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Possibly my favourite objective in the white paper is that the government wants one-third of board members of Australian's top companies to have a 'deep knowledge' of Asia. I simply ask the question: what on earth does the composition of company boards have to do with the government? Sure, we want to harness the opportunities that come out of Asia, but we do not want to stifle the management and administrative decisions of private enterprises. But that is effectively what this is suggesting. It is urging government influence and manipulation of the board composition of private organisations. It would be funny if it were not so serious.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The white paper was accompanied by no fewer than 21 press releases, including one titled 'Boosting innovation in the Asian century'. The report and the accompanying releases talk, for instance, about the importance of R&amp;D, commercialisation and international scientific collaboration. But this is the very government that has forced changes to public support for business R&amp;D, and that has provoked outrage from industry and even from trade unions. It led one expert observer to conclude that they have ushered in 'the worst environment for government support for R&amp;D in this country for the past 25 years'. It is also the very government that has uprooted support for commercialisation activity by abolishing, including without any advance warning to applicants, the highly successful Commercial Ready and COMET programs, and then leaving this crucial facet of the innovation process unsupported by the government for 18 months before eventually stumping up a fraction of the previous funding through a substantially inferior program. It is the very government that slashed tens of millions of dollars for science education programs for primary and secondary school students, before eventually being shamed into restoring these programs by Nobel Laureate Professor Brian Schmidt and the coalition. And it is the very government that has abolished the International Science Linkages program, which for more than a decade provided funding for the same international science exchanges, information sharing and collaboration that the government now tries to pretend it has always recognised the merits of supporting.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">So farcical was its ineptitude on this subject that we had the Keystone Cops style sight at an estimates hearing of the then science minister, Senator Carr, trying to deny he had axed a program and eventually being dragged—along with the embarrassed public servants around him—into admitting that all funding to it had been discontinued. This is just another distraction, another farcical attempt of the government to pretend it has some policy and some ideas for the future prosperity of this country. It is bankrupt of ideas. The very policies that have fostered science, that have fostered innovation, have been gutted and will continue to be gutted. It is all well and good making great motherhood statements, but it is a cruel hoax when actions fall far short of the actual sentiments expressed.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">
                  <a href="DZY" type="MemberSpeech">
                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Mr GEORGANAS</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Hindmarsh</span>—<span class="HPS-MinisterialTitles">Second Deputy Speaker</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">21:45</span>):  I was very pleased on Friday to have a cuppa with some great people in my electorate and to be taking part in one of the 1,700 DisabiliTEA events that were happening across the country that day, part of countrywide disability morning and afternoon teas to promote the NDIS, to get people talking about it and to enable them to talk to people who would be in the thick of things with the NDIS.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I want to thank Margaret Gadd, a local campaigner in my electorate, for making Friday possible. She invited a few friends around to her place down at Glenelg, where I visited. We had a cup of coffee and a piece of cake and discussed the NDIS. I want to acknowledge what great people Margaret and all her friends were during that morning tea. We discussed an area of public policy that for far too long has been left on the sidelines of our social awareness, and that is the plight of people with disabilities.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Most of us have heard dreadful stories about non-existing services for people with disabilities, and we know that many of us, in all electorates, hear those stories on a regular basis. These horror stories are very real. The impact on family members and on their carers is very real. Our responsibility, as a government of the nation, to offer these people a better life could not be more necessary. Margaret Gadd, who was the host of this morning DisabiliTEA in support of change for people with disabilities, and her friends who were there to discuss the NDIS with me, clearly recognise that not all things are as they should be at the moment, or as they could be. Margaret and her friends are very good people to the core. They recognise that we as a society can and must do more for those who are unable, due to their disabilities, to do for themselves.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I have met many more people around my electorate of Hindmarsh who think and feel very similarly to Margaret and her friends. With the support of all of these people in my electorate and around the nation we will see improvements in the way people with disabilities are treated, the options they are presented and the prospects they can entertain through their lives. With their support, we will see a National Disability Insurance Scheme developed and rolled out around the nation. We have no option. We must do this. If we are half reasonable people we must embrace this change and do what we know to be right and good. So, again, I would like to thank Margaret Gadd for inviting me to her morning DisabiliTEA and also thank her friends for their interest in this critical area of public policy. I look forward to speaking with them again on a regular basis.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I also attended an afternoon DisabiliTEA that same day at an institution that is known by South Australians to be synonymous with care for the disabled: Minda, at Brighton. At that afternoon tea it was not I who spoke of the government's plans for the NDIS; the Prime Minister herself was there. In this very different setting from my morning tea, with a different collection of people, I saw the same recognition that we as a nation must change the way we treat and provide for people who are in need of assistance.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The Prime Minister was very warmly received in that context, as I was in the previous tea—and so was the Premier, Jay Weatherill, who was also there. These DisabiliTEA events—over 1,700 of them across Australia—clearly illustrated, in my mind, how receptive the Australian public is to what this government proposes and how right the time is now for the development of a National Disability Insurance Scheme. Of course, we hope everyone in this place will jump on board and support it. I fully expect that this government will continue with these trials and that through the experience of development of systems we will see Labor continue with the development of the NDIS and its creation—a fully operational national scheme in the years ahead.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I was very pleased to see that South Australia—my home state—was one of the very first states to jump on board, and there will be a trial pilot program starting next year. It will be launched in mid-2013 for children aged nought to four years, and it will expand to 14-year-olds over the launch. That is nearly 5,000 children who will be benefiting from this. The federal government will be investing about $30 million for this launch. <span style="font-style:italic;">(Time expired)</span></span>

                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Mr RAMSEY</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Grey</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">21:50</span>):  On Saturday 20 October I was given the pleasure—and, indeed, the honour—of meeting the Clarke family from Port Augusta. David and Jo are, by any standards, great young parents. They have three children, and they are just the type of family we all love to have in our electorates. They are motivated, good parents. David was a tiler and has just become a train driver, and I congratulate him. He is looking forward to his new career.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">But their life has been a little rockier than that of most young families. A little over two years ago their daughter Lexi, now six, was diagnosed with type 1 diabetes, or juvenile diabetes. My meeting with the Clarkes was part of the Juvenile Diabetes Research Foundation walk for diabetes. It was a great pleasure to sit down with Lexi and her mother. Lexi told me about her challenge in life—how she spent a good part of the last 12 months in and out of hospital with chronic asthma; how her mother, Jo, gave up work so she could spend time with her daughter through that period and do what caring parents have to do: be with their children and make sure they get the best outcome.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I tell you these stories about Lexi, and she sounds sick, but she certainly did not look sick on the day I met her—she was an absolute delight. I must say, if the aim of the Juvenile Diabetes Research Foundation with the Walk with Diabetes is having these young people meet with parliamentarians and pulling our heartstrings, it certainly worked. But we did get to discuss the serious issues about how to tackle life. Lexi had done a beautiful little drawing for me, and gave me a jar of jelly babies, which I am yet to attack but which I have put on one of the desks in my office so that we can explain the cause.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I walked the 3.2 kilometres with Lexi. I got to carry her a bit of the way too, I must admit, and pop her up on my shoulders, which I used to do with my own children. That was a great pleasure for me—as I said, it was an honour—but the challenge that the Juvenile Diabetes Research Foundation places on us parliamentarians is that we do something to help find a cure for this disease.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">On 28 and 29 of November the JDRF will again be in parliament for the Kids in the House, and I know most members will be making sure they meet their local representatives. Since 1970 the Juvenile Diabetes Research Foundation has put more than $1.6 billion into research, trying to find a worldwide cure. I know they are currently seeking funds to try and have advanced clinical trials in Australia, and I know this is one of the issues that reaches across all sides of parliament—trying to find really good outcomes for the kids, not only in our electorates but right throughout Australia.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">My own niece was diagnosed with juvenile diabetes at the age of 17, which is really quite a rare occurrence. She deals very well with her life. And the advent of the pumps has certainly made a real difference to the many people who suffer from this disease, and has certainly made a great difference to Lexi's life. I congratulate the way the family faces their challenges, and I urge all members to make time to speak to this fantastic organisation when they come back in the next week of parliament.

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">
                  <a href="172770" type="MemberSpeech">
                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Ms SMYTH</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">La Trobe</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">21:54</span>):  Many things have happened in the electorate of La Trobe in recent weeks, and I hope to update the House on a few of them. Specifically, and firstly, a community discussion that I held, together with the Minister for Housing, Minister for Homelessness and Minister for Small Business at Ferntree Gully Uniting Church during the course of Anti-Poverty Week a couple of weeks ago, which focused on housing and homelessness initiatives undertaken by this government and the circumstances that many people find themselves in in relation to housing affordability and homelessness, throughout Victoria and indeed around Australia, and in respect of which the government is doing much—and, of course, it need not be said that much more remains to be done; but the government has done great work. I must thank the Ferntree Gully Uniting Church, and also the Tecoma Uniting Church, for their involvement on the day and for hosting it.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I thought I would update the House particularly in relation to this because, in my electorate alone, the government's Social Housing Initiative has meant that over $19 million has been spent on 66 new dwellings, with 60 completed to date. Of those which are tenanted, 75 per cent have been tenanted to people who would otherwise have faced homelessness, 15 per cent to elderly people and 22 per cent to people with disability—noting that tenants can be in more than one category. So these are practical ways in which this government is making significant commitments to people who would otherwise potentially face hardship or difficulty in finding housing.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">It was appropriate that we held the forum in Ferntree Gully, not terribly far from the site of two significant social housing developments, one of which I have visited with the minister on a previous occasion, which has seen 14 one-bedroom units and 18 two-bedroom units developed. The facility incorporates six-star energy ratings including water tanks and energy-efficient lighting and heating. It is an excellent facility and I was delighted to go along and meet with Wilf and Francesca, an elderly couple who had recently moved into social housing there. It was great to hear their story about being able to settle in the community around Boronia.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Likewise, there is another social housing development that has stood to the benefit of residents of Ferntree Gully, on the corner of Dorset Road and Burwood Highway, which has been constructed with the assistance of this government—and, it must be said, with considerable opposition from the opposition, both in terms of the commitment to funding for that project and for projects of its kind right around the country using stimulus funding. It was additionally opposed quite vehemently by local members of the Liberal Party at the time of its construction, which was most disappointing.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Victoria has stood to benefit very significant through the federal government's investments, not only in relation to the construction of dwellings through social housing and the Social Housing Initiative but through repairs to around 90 dwellings, for instance, with over $400,000 being committed to that in my electorate alone. It is regrettable against that backdrop that, at the same time as the federal government consistently makes significant investments in social housing and initiatives to reduce homelessness, and initiatives to improve housing and rental affordability, the Victorian government has elected to decrease funding to the Social Housing Advocacy and Support Program by almost $3 million in the 2012-13 financial year. It is most regrettable indeed, and certainly noted by Victorians.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The second matter about which I will briefly update the House in the time remaining to me is a forum which I held with the Minister for Ageing in recent weeks at the Emerald U3A. I am delighted to continue my engagement with University of the Third Age organisations throughout my electorate, and have recently had the opportunity to visit the Knox U3A, the Casey U3A and the Emerald U3A for a range of activities. The Emerald U3A generously hosted an event, which was extremely well attended. Many people were clearly very interested in the government's proposals in relation to aged-care reform under the Living Longer, Living Better package, which members will no doubt recall provides around $3.7 billion over five years and is focused on trying to give elderly Australians and post-retirement Australians an opportunity to remain in their homes for longer and to give people an opportunity to have greater choice in relation to their aged-care options. There was great interest in Emerald U3A, and my thanks go to the president, Michael Allery, for that; and my congratulations go to the Knox U3A, and its president Lawrie Gaylard, and to Casey U3A, and its outgoing president, Pat Stone, for their recent initiatives also. <span style="font-style:italic;">(Time expired)</span></span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">
                  <a href="HWO" type="MemberSpeech">
                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Mr HAWKE</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Mitchell</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">21:59</span>):  I rise to speak today on a fine legacy of my predecessor, the Hon. Alan Cadman OAM, and that is the Mitchell Youth Leadership Forum, established by him some 10 years ago as a visionary new initiative for youth in the Mitchell electorate. The Mitchell Youth Leadership Forum is a 2½-day live-in program for year 11 students, strongly based around the three core values of service to others, integrity and courage. I have had the privilege of being the president of this organisation for five years. The forum is a great chance for year 11 students to come together and share their thoughts and ideas on how to be great, inspirational leaders in their schools and in our community. Each year every high school in my district—public and private—sends 10 children of year 11 age to this forum, and each year they come away having had a very special experience with each other and with leadership, which produces a better quality person.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Earlier this year, I was delighted to host a 10th anniversary dinner to honour this incredible milestone in excellence in leadership in the Mitchell electorate. The celebration brought together over 200 past and present students, leaders, speakers, sponsors, principals, volunteers and committee members. In 2002, it is key to note, only 95 students attended the inaugural forum, and now we have up to 160 each year attending. This year we had about 130, from 14 schools across my electorate, who were ably led by 55 young leaders.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I would like to thank all those who have come and spoken to the forum from 2002 onwards, who have given their time and imparted knowledge to the next generation of leaders. I would like to mention all of our sponsors, who have so generously contributed over many years. For 10 years, B Braun, based in my electorate, has been a visionary on-board sponsor of Fuelhouse, the underlying fundraising vehicle for the Mitchell Youth Leadership Forum. I want to mention Nature's Sunshine Australia, and particularly Stephen Webster, the founder of this great community-minded business in my electorate. I also want to mention Parker Hannifin; PricewaterhouseCoopers Australia, and the Norwest office in particular; Shelton's Quality Meats; Smiling Bakery; Allan Drew Funerals; and Redeemer Baptist School, who faithfully donate all their school vehicles every year for the forum.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I would particularly like to note the following schools: Baulkham Hills High School, Castle Hill High School, Crestwood High School, Evans High School, Galston High School, Gilroy Catholic College, Kellyville High School, Model Farms High School, Muirfield High School, Northholm Grammar School, Northmead High School, Redeemer Baptist School, Redfield College, Tangara School for Girls, The King's School, Rouse Hill Anglican College and William Clarke College. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I want to thank the principals who had the vision 10 years ago to get on board with this great initiative and the principals of today who continue their support of this excellent service for our community. Each year, part of the program is that these young leaders engage in a community service act. This year's community service was at our local Anglican Retirement Village at Castle Hill, a huge campus where students spent quality time with very elderly and frail residents and worked to complete outstanding jobs and things that were long overdue for the residents of the Anglican Retirement Village.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The Mitchell Youth Leadership Forum is so special because of the voluntary effort of many leaders. The great system that produces this is that each year we have a body of leaders who have come through the forum who voluntarily return to train, to lead small groups and to continue the tradition of the Mitchell Youth Leadership Forum. We have a great committee of veterans, some from 10 years ago and many from today, who form our board, which I chair. I want to make particular mention of Veronica Quinn, our CEO; Alain Vella; Ged Lewis; Ken Shaw; Lukasz Swiatek; Matt Puleo; Steve Edwards; Terry Swan; and Jan Cox. These outstanding individuals do a great job for the youth of Mitchell.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">There is really nothing like the Mitchell Youth Leadership Forum in school curriculums today, which takes year 11 students out of their normal environment, puts them in groups of their peers, whom they have never met before, and takes away their mobile phones and other communications to the outside world so that they can focus, in a small group environment, on leadership and the values of service, integrity and courage. It is a great program. We have great success every year. All the students who participate come away with a greater understanding of themselves and the values that make a great leader.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I want to pay a particular tribute to the Hon. Alan Cadman for his great vision in putting this forward, for having the ability to make it last and extend it to other electorates, including Gilmore and Macquarie—and I believe it is soon to be in Chifley and other areas of New South Wales. I encourage members of this House to have a forum in their own electorates. There is nothing better they could do, because it is an outstanding institution.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Bass</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">22:04</span>):  Launceston, in my electorate of Bass, has always been a pioneering Australian city. Launceston is home to the first licensed hotel in Australia, which was licensed in 1814, and the first country newspaper, and in 1847 Launceston was the first place in the Southern Hemisphere to use anaesthetics in a surgical operation. The Launceston Chamber of Commerce was the first to be formed in Australia, and in 1851 we were the first in Australia to hold a first-class cricket match, between Victoria and Tasmania. The innovation does not stop there. Launceston was the first city in the Southern Hemisphere to be lit by hydro-electric power. In 1896 Launceston had the first X-rays, and it has the oldest continuously operating radiology department in Australia. In 1916, Launceston RSL Club was the first RSL club in Australia to receive its charter. Launceston was the first Australian city to add fluoride to its water supply and we were the first place to use humidicribs and an infant iron lung. I was most pleased to point out the many achievements of Launceston when the community cabinet met in Launceston recently. Launceston was also one of the first cities to start the rollout of the NBN. This is a great investment in the future of Launceston and has great potential for our region. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Yet our state is at risk. We are at risk of the member for Warringah and his colleagues destroying our state by pandering to their state Liberal counterparts about GST distribution. Respected economist Saul Eslake recently expressed his concern about this situation. On radio on 23 October, Saul Eslake confirmed that the Leader of the Opposition represented a big risk to Tasmania's GST revenues:</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Small">Tony Abbott has…indicated a fair degree of sympathy for the outrageous claims that Western Australians have been making for a bigger share of the GST revenue, and I guess he…calculates that there are potentially more votes to be gained for his side of politics from appearing to sympathise with Western Australia's claims than there are votes for him in Tasmania from appearing to reject them.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">This sums it up quite well. Those opposite are after a vote grab at the expense of teachers, police, doctors and nurses in Tasmania.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">When the Leader of the Opposition was last in Tasmania for the Liberal Party state conference, I called on him to rule out cutting our GST. My call was not answered. Those opposite pose a big threat to my state, a threat to the families that make Tassie the great place it is. I will not stay silent on this issue, and it is about time those opposite stood up to Premier Campbell Newman and Premier Colin Barnett and ruled out their populist pleas.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">It is also of great concern to me that the Tasmanian Liberals recently welcomed Premier Campbell Newman to Tasmania for a fundraiser. Premier Newman has shown that he fails the decency test by axing jobs and cutting funding to important services in Queensland. Yet the Tasmanian Liberal Party see him as their poster boy, happily posing for photos with him, listening to his address and backing the decisions he has made in Queensland.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Our Federation has survived for 111 years. The notion of a fair go is being put in danger by the Leader of the Opposition's dangerous pandering to his Liberal mates in the resource rich states. His $630 million cut to Tasmania's share of GST revenue would devastate my state's economy. The Leader of the Opposition, like his state Tasmanian colleagues, talks our state down at every opportunity. They are blind to some of the great projects and innovations that are happening in Tasmania, which I highlight regularly in this chamber. </span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">Australia's economy does have patchwork pressures and, although the economic fundamentals are strong, there are pressures on some industries and some regions. Throughout our history the fortunes of towns, cities and states have shifted with the economic winds of the day. But there is one constant—the benefit of a united Australia has ensured a fair go for all Australians.</span>

I encourage all Tasmanians to contact your Liberal senators and explain to them that you oppose this Liberal change to GST distribution. The Gillard Labor government is working hard to invest in our nation's future in skills, education, infrastructure and technology such as NBN.

                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Mr CHRISTENSEN</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Dawson</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">22:10</span>):  On the morning of 15 February 2008 a disaster was unfolding in Mackay, North Queensland. An extraordinary amount of rain fell in a six-hour period in what was later described as one-in-200-year flood event. It resulted obviously in widespread floodwaters, ruining homes across the city. Again, in 2011, North Queenslanders suffered disaster at the hands of Cyclone Yasi, the worst cyclone to hit Queensland in almost 100 years. But the disaster unfolding in North Queensland today is no less a disaster than those two events. The insurance disaster choking North Queensland this year is the unreasonable and unconscionable actions of insurance companies to whom the Gillard Labor government has given free rein.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Whether home owners want it or not—whether they need it or not—they are having outrageously expensive flood insurance thrust upon them. Homes in West Mackay and Home Hill with insurance premiums of  $1,700 last year are paying more than $3,000 this year. In Mackay, the QBE's premium increase this year has gone from $135.73 a month to $253.38 per month—an 87 per cent increase.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">But they are the lucky ones. An Allianz home and contents insurance premium in Andergrove went from $94 a month last year to $356 a month this year—that is almost a four-fold increase. The premium for a Mackay home went from $1,992 last year to a price-gouging $8,133 this year—more than triple in a single year, and that is for a house that didn't even flood in the one-in-200-year flood event in 2008. A two-bedroom Mackay house with a premium of $2,642 last year went to $13,616 this year. The owner has not paid it because she cannot find that much money.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Home owners are considering dropping cover altogether. But unit owners are compelled by law to have strata title insurance. A set of units in Bowen has seen their premiums rise from $6,668 in 2009 to $48,000 in 2012, with the cyclone excess rising from $100 to $10,000. Mark Faulkner has a property in a five-level residential building in Mackay, where the insurance premium went from $25,000 in one year to $102,000 the next.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">There is also the bizarre case where Mackay resident Karen Leibie is wondering what her insurance premium bill will be when it arrives in a month's time. In the past three years, her insurance bill has risen from $600 to $1,100 and then to $2,200. And what is it for? A shared driveway—just a driveway.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">What is a greater disaster for North Queensland is a complete market failure. When we are seeing homes in Townsville being charged premiums of $20,000 and a home in Ingham charged $26,000, we have market failure. My colleague, the member for Leichhardt, reports that a guest house cannot get insurance at all after 13 rejections and the bank is now asking them to 'show cause'. Faced with a 324 per cent insurance premium increase for Seastar Apartments, Whitsunday resident Margaret Shaw, who lives there, sought alternative cover from QBE, AMP, CHU, Chubb, QUS, Zurich, Allianz, Wesfarmers-Lumley and Vero. None were prepared to quote for North Queensland or for properties of that value except Vero, who offered the same ridiculously high premium as SUU but with a $100,000 cyclone excess.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The House of Representatives Standing Committee on Social Policy and Legal Affairs held an inquiry into strata title insurance affordability last year. Shamefully, the only recommendation the government adopted was one that handballs the problem to the state government, while the other one was the commissioning of a government actuary report on insurance in North Queensland The report they did, though, was nothing more than a regurgitation of the Insurance Council of Australia propaganda that has failed to fool North Queenslanders who have had their budgets gouged by insurance companies for the past two years. The report says, basically, 'I have not found that insurers have been price gouging.' My response is, 'Because you did not look.' Responding to the report, one of the tireless workers in my electorate on this issue, Lester Riley, wrote:</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Small">You have totally misrepresented the situation existing in the actual marketplace. The phrases used in the report have all been heard before from the insurance companies but that does not mean that they are truthful.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Lester is a self-funded retiree, and he says:</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Small">I am watching my life savings and value of the property I live in continue to decline at an alarming rate.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Lester and Margaret Shaw have proposed further ways for the government and insurance companies to solve this issue, and one of those is something the government did not implement, which is the expansion of the Australian Reinsurance Pool Corporation that John Howard set up to avoid market failure for terrorism insurance in the wake of the 2001 terrorist attacks. The government did not want to use the fund to avoid market failure in North Queensland, but, as my colleague, the member for Herbert, points out, it did not stop— <span style="font-style:italic;">(Time expired)</span></span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Reid</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">22:15</span>):  The unending catalogue of denials and distortions that the opposition uses in its foolish campaign against the government's clean energy policies shows that they are willing to go to any length to court the ignorant, the misinformed and the vested interests that fund the opposition. I draw the House's attention to increasingly disturbing reports which, more than ever, support the government's policies to reduce emissions of carbon dioxide from burning fossil fuels while the opposition claims that nothing needs to be done.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Following the publication in 1830 of Charles Lyell's <span style="font-style:italic;">Principles of Geology</span>, palaeontologists have discovered that the history of life on this planet has been punctuated by a series of mass extinctions—most recently, in geological terms, the extinction of the dinosaurs 65 million years ago, which ended the Cretaceous period. A 180 kilometre wide crater in Mexico and deposits of soot and the element iridium, common in meteorites, at the well-defined boundary in the rocks between the Cretaceous and Tertiary periods shows that the dinosaurs and other life forms were wiped out by the impact of an asteroid that exploded with the power of a million megatonnes of TNT. That mass extinction was preceded by four other major mass extinctions, most notably the one at the end of the Permian period, 250 million years ago, which killed over 95 per cent of all life forms on the planet and came the closest of the known mass extinctions to wiping out all advanced life forms.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">This unparalleled mass extinction is relevant today because it was caused by a massive release of carbon dioxide from the largest volcanic eruptions in the last 500 million years in what is now Siberia. This started a runaway greenhouse effect that roasted the planet and poisoned the seas. The scientific evidence shows that the carbon dioxide emissions from the Siberian event were at rates less than presently produced by burning fossil fuels, such as coal, oil and natural gas, and raised average global temperatures by up to five degrees, an increase below that predicted for temperatures by the end of this century. Those increases of average global temperatures triggered a massive release of methane from seabed sediments that led to the largest mass extinction in the planet's history.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The conditions that characterised the Permian extinction are being duplicated as I speak. We are already seeing a rapid expansion of dead zones, areas so depleted in oxygen that sea life cannot exist. More than 400 ocean dead zones were reported by oceanographers around the world between 2000 and 2008, compared with 300 in the 1990s and 120 in the 1980s. University of Queensland Professor Ove Hoegh-Guldberg, from the Australian Research Council Centre of Excellence for Coral Reef Studies, says there is growing evidence that declining oxygen levels in the ocean have played a major role in at least four of the planet's five mass extinctions. While the dead zones exist only in pockets of ocean today, Professor Hoegh-Guldberg warns that a far greater area will be affected in the future unless steps are taken to reduce the impact of human activities on the world's oceans and their life forms.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Our government bases its policies on evidence, not on ignorance or prejudice or political opportunism, and is willing to act on what the evidence increasingly shows is no longer a moral threat but, rather, a mortal threat to the lives of every Australian, young and old. The evidence is there for all to see: carbon dioxide emissions are driving up global temperatures and the acidification of the oceans at a greater rate than that which occurred at the time of the Permian extinction. Unless emissions of carbon dioxide are quickly curtailed by very significant reductions in the consumption of coal, oil and natural gas, it seems that we will soon duplicate the conditions that led to the Permian extinction. Although this time the cause of the mass extinction event will be human greed and stupidity rather than uncontrollable natural forces.</span>

                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Mr BRIGGS</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Mayo</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">22:19</span>):  I rise to table a petition which has 6,000 signatures. It relates to the McLaren Vale &amp; Districts War Memorial Hospital, which state and federal Labor policies have affected in quite an adverse way. This petition from McLaren Vale, McLaren Flat, Willunga, Clarendon and Kangarilla residents, and certain citizens of Australia, draws to the attention of the House the cost impact of the carbon tax on McLaren Vale &amp; Districts War Memorial Hospital and also the South Australian Labor government's report which recommends cutting the hospital's funding by $1.5 million. The carbon tax is expected to increase the hospital's operating costs, particularly its electricity costs, and any decision by the South Australian Labor government to cut funding to the hospital would force it to close. We know this because the chairman of the hospital, Mr Bryan Hearn, wrote to the member for Kingston. McLaren Vale is currently in the electorate of Kingston, but after a redistribution it will be in the electorate of Mayo at the next election. Mr Hearn copied me in on that letter. He made the point that the annual increase in electricity costs for the hospital will be $5,000, with no relief at all from the government. So there is a big increase in costs and a report issued by the South Australian government suggesting that there should be a cut of some $1.5 million a year to the hospital's funding—which of course would have shut it down.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">As the shadow parliamentary secretary at the table knows, the state Labor governments across the country have been implementing a model of centralising hospital services no matter what the impact on local communities. It has taken away significant local services from across our country, across our regions, particularly in electorates like mine and the member for Barker's in South Australia. That electorate has famously seen the Keith hospital become a very contentious local issue in South Australia, and it has been for some time. The South Australian local government cut the funding to the Keith hospital because of its bureaucratic mindset on the way that it believes it should run health.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Since 6,000 people have signed this petition which will be tabled this evening in this place, there has been a backdown of sorts by the South Australian Minister for Health and Ageing, Mr Hill, who has given some commitment for a period of months to ongoing funding while negotiations continue. We are pleased that Minister Hill has come to his senses in that sense for that short period. I note today a story on the adelaidenow website which says 'People power saves McLaren Vale hospital'. I would add 'not quite yet'. Certainly it has given the McLaren Vale hospital some additional time, but what we need to see from state Labor is a real commitment to regional health services being delivered to regional communities like the McLaren Vale.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We need to see from federal Labor their carbon tax abolished. We know that will not happen, so what we really need is a change of government to get rid of that carbon tax, because it has no real environmental benefit and it damages health services like this to the tune of $5,000. The government does not care at all. It has the effect in the end of putting at risk the services delivered into this area, not just to McLaren Vale and Districts War Memorial Hospital but to the surrounding areas of the Fleurieu Peninsula and other areas in a growing part of Adelaide—delivering services, taking pressure off the health network across the country.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The double whammy of these federal Labor and state Labor policies is having a genuine effect on this community. I congratulate the chairperson, Bryan Hearn, and the CEO, David Fechner, for their work so far. But I say to them and to the community: continue the fight. There are 6,000 petition signatures here. It should start to wake up both state and federal Labor to the effect on your community. We will continue to fight on your behalf for continued and better health services in your region.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">
                  <a href="HWG" type="MemberSpeech">
                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Mr DREYFUS</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Isaacs</span>—<span class="HPS-MinisterialTitles">Cabinet Secretary, Parliamentary Secretary for Climate Change and Energy Efficiency and Parliamentary Secretary for Industry and Innovation</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">22:25</span>):  The government's white paper published this week, <span style="font-style:italic;">Australia in the Asian </span><span style="font-style:italic;">c</span><span style="font-style:italic;">entury</span>, deals with a matter of great importance to all Australians. Put simply, it is the government's plan to make sure that Australia is a winner in the Asian century. It takes a particularly negative approach to label a white paper such as this, on a matter of such significance to all Australians, a 'waste of time'. But that is what the member for North Sydney did, and that was before even reading it.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Tonight we have had the member for Indi—who claimed she had read the white paper, at least enough to quote from it—with more of the hallmark negativity we have come to associate with this opposition. After two years of running all over the country repeating the gross misrepresentations of the Leader of the Opposition about the carbon price, the member for Indi is realising, it would seem, that the carbon price scare campaign is running out of puff. So she has turned her negativity and misrepresentation tonight to the Asian century white paper. The anti-carbon-price campaign has run out of puff because the crazy predictions of Whyalla becoming a ghost town or the coal industry coming to an end or $100 legs of lamb simply have not happened, and they are not going to happen. The mad forecasts of prices going up and up and up, and job losses, and the madder forecasts of business failure have not come to pass either, and they are not going to come to pass.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">From the member for Mayo we have just had a little bit more misrepresentation about the alleged effects of the carbon price on the health system. They are without foundation. They ignore the arrangements between the federal government and the state governments over the health system, in particular hospitals. Instead of apologising to the people of Australia for the falsely based scare campaign that we have now had to endure for over two years from those opposite, instead of apologising to the people of Australia, which is what the Liberal Party should be doing, the negativity is now turned to other topics. For the member for Indi, that apparently means selectively and sneeringly quoting from the Asian century white paper rather than giving it serious thought and actually debating something that is of great importance to the future of our country. This is from a party with no plan for the future, no plan for a modern Australia and no plan for a deeper engagement with our region—just negative and destructive carping and sneering.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I do not have time to canvass more than a couple of aspects of the Asian century white paper which this opposition is so quick to condemn. It is important to understand it for what it is. We have been working to get our nation ready for the century of change that is upon us. The white paper brings together the policy directions that our government has already been working on, and it adds to those policy directions. It is a policy paper not just for the government but for the whole of our community. So for the member for Indi to deride this paper on the basis that it offers some suggestions to the business community as to how they might better engage with Asia is to entirely and apparently wilfully misunderstand the purpose of a white paper and to misunderstand the purpose of this particular white paper. The direction we are heading in is higher skills, higher incomes, more job opportunities for Australians. As the white paper explains, we are aiming to see a growth in national income for all Australians. We are aiming to see our country put in the top 10 in the world and, by 2025, to see an average increase in incomes of $11,000. We have been working very directly to get our nation ready.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The passages in the white paper I would commend to all members of this parliament dealing with language education—far from being sneered at—grapple with one of the great inadequacies that we have in Australia, which is an inadequate understanding of languages of other countries, and particularly the languages of Asian nations. That is why this white paper contains three national objectives to increase our Asian literature as a core requirement so that all students will have an opportunity to study an Asian language from their first day at school through to year 12.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Casey</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">16:01</span>):  It is my pleasure to pay tribute to three ladies: the Pinker sisters—Sue, Catherine and Kim—who were raised in the Yarra Valley. Back in 2007, five years ago, Kim was diagnosed with breast cancer at the age of 31. As a result of this, the sisters were spurred to take action to try and bring about greater awareness of breast cancer within the local community of the Yarra Valley and the broader electorate of Casey, which I represent. Specifically, they wanted to build on the great work being done by many breast cancer organisations. But they wanted to do so in a way that focused attention at the community level—to raise funds in the local community for the local community and to raise awareness as well as dollars. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">As a result, they decided to create the Melbourne Breast Cancer Bra Walk. Last year this walk took place in the centre of Melbourne at Federation Square and achieved its objectives of raising both money and awareness. This year, it was decided that they would hold the walk locally and they did so on Sunday, 21 October, at the Lillydale Lake—and they did so with more than 240 other participants. I was pleased to be there to participate in the walk and to help the sisters on the day. The money raised from both the walk and from a VIP fundraising night earlier in the week has enabled some very important funds to go to the Maroondah Breast Clinic and to the Yarra Valley Ladies in Pink, who do so much to support those with breast cancer in the Yarra Valley. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I want to pay tribute to a few people. Narelle King was the auctioneer for the VIP night, which Tamara Lloyd from Ray White in Croydon helped to organise. Jill Rule and her team from the Mt Evelyn and Montrose Bendigo Bank were sponsors and supporters. Yvette Boase, from Yvette's Facepainting, helped paint the faces of many kids—and a few adults, I have to say—on the day of the walk. Finally, I pay tribute to Sue Calder, one of those sisters who did so much work. She is a true champion of the local community. She did so much work and showed such passion and dedication to bring this great event about. I know she will be very involved in the years to come. <span style="font-style:italic;">(Time expired)</span></span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">The federal Labor government delivered $2 million towards this $3.1 million project, so I am very proud, as the local MP, to have delivered that funding and to be opening this outstanding centre. It is replacing a very small centre that has been there for a long time, and I would like to congratulate everyone in the community who worked very hard to make this project a reality. It has been thought about and spoken about for many years, and it is certainly needed in the area.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Prior to the last federal election, in August 2010, the then Minister for Infrastructure, Transport, Regional Development and Local Government, Mr Anthony Albanese, and I made the announcement on the site of the very old community centre that if the Gillard Labor government was re-elected we would be delivering $1.5 million in funding. We delivered on that election commitment, and we also delivered an extra half a million dollars through the Regional and Local Community Infrastructure Program, so a total of $2 million from the federal Labor government for this outstanding project. As I said, we announced that in August 2010. We turned the first sod in November 2011. That was a great occasion as well. The community centre provides space for a large number of offices and a whole host of different activity rooms. It is a major centre where they can provide a whole host of services to the community. There is also going to be a youth centre. I understand it will be incorporated as well. As I said, it will be located on the site of the current centre, which is very small.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">When I look to the funding breakdown, I would like to acknowledge a major community contribution as well. The Lions Club of Murwillumbah have contributed $300,000 towards the project, which is an outstanding contribution. They, along with many other members of the community, were very much involved in making sure that this community centre became a reality. I would also like to congratulate the Tweed Shire Council, which has been very committed to this for a long time and is contributing more than $600,000 for the project. It is an outstanding community centre for the area that will provide much-needed services right across Murwillumbah and right throughout the Tweed Valley. I particularly congratulate everyone in the community who is involved with it, particularly the management committee of the community centre. They have been very much involved in advocating for the new centre and the design of it and making sure that the services there are wide-ranging. Congratulations to them and to the entire community, who have worked incredibly hard for many years. As I said, I am very proud as the local MP, to deliver $2 million towards this—part of the $1.3 billion that I have delivered for delivered roads, education, health and community infrastructure—and we all look forward to a great community day on Saturday, 24 November as we officially open the Murwillumbah Community Centre.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">

                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Mr WYATT</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Hasluck</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">16:07</span>):  I have rise to speak on the Harper Street, Woodbridge, unit development. On Tuesday, 16 October I met with residents of Harper Street and the surrounding streets of Woodbridge to hear their concerns relating to a 39-unit development in the cul-de-sac at the end of their street. At 4 pm on Tuesday afternoon, more than 30 people gathered to represent the many residents of the area who were extremely disheartened with their local council about the matter. Many of these residents have lived in the area for years and had planned to retire there, while others have built homes and had plans to raise their families in this particularly family-oriented and friendly suburb of Woodbridge.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">While these people are not opposed to development in their local area, the concerns they have are legitimate. The overwhelming feeling in the community is that there has not been enough consultation or acknowledgement and that they have not been listened to when they have approached the local government with their concerns. Most significant amongst these concerns is that of safety issues, including that of the fire and emergency service access. There appears to be only one point of vehicle entry to the whole development of five separate three-storey buildings with only one walkway access to the rear units on the development. If a fire breaks out there is a very real danger to the surrounding properties.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The next issue is the traffic flow, with 39 car bays designated for the development. That allows for one car per unit. The development is at the end of a cul-de-sac, so even with just 39 extra vehicles coming and going, and with only one point of entry, the congestion, noise, parking issues and general business will be unacceptable and dangerous. Another major issue is that of the rubbish collection. There is very limited access to the small area for rubbish trucks to negotiate for the rubbish collection. The development plan proposes combined bin storage at the rear of the property, which skirts the residential property behind. The direct neighbours are concerned that the bins will cause unpleasant odours, encourage rats from adjacent wetlands and provide a breeding ground for flies. There are environmental concerns as well, as the site was previously used as a dump for asbestos, tyres, refrigerators, hospital waste and car batteries and it has taken 10 to 15 years to get the adjoining wetlands back to a vibrant state.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The valid concern about the enormity of the development is that it will once again put the area at risk. One of the issues that most residents faced was the lack of consultation and consideration in the planning processes. The point I want to make is that often residents have no real process of engaging with the three tiers of government to express their concerns and frustrations when developments occur in areas where they have planned to have families and to be in a family oriented suburb. <span style="font-style:italic;">(Time expired)</span></span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">McMahon</span>—<span class="HPS-MinisterialTitles">Minister for Immigration and Citizenship</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">16:10</span>):  I want to pass on my condolences following the loss of Mr Stanley Anderson, who passed away yesterday. I received a call around lunchtime yesterday to let me know that Mr Anderson passed away yesterday morning. Although Mr Anderson had had some health issues in recent years, his death comes as a great shock to the Smithfield community and I know to his family, and I wanted in the House of Representatives to pay tribute to him and to extend my condolences to his family.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Stan was President of the Smithfield RSL Club, and he had been on the board for a long time and a member for over 30 years. He was also a long-serving member of the New South Wales Police Service in various capacities. Most particularly, he was a well-known figure in the Smithfield community—a man who made a great contribution. Personally, when I asked him if Smithfield RSL could host my annual pink ribbon morning tea, he would say yes, or our annual seniors morning tea, he would say yes. He would always provide an opportunity for Smithfield RSL Club to contribute to the broader community. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">He was also a great character—a larger than life figure; a big man with a big heart who was great company. As honourable members would understand and appreciate, at RSL functions and other community functions I would have the opportunity to spend time with Stan. He was always good for a laugh, good for a joke and good for a colourful insight into the local community. He was President of the Western Region of Clubs New South Wales, and therefore made his contribution on a broader scale than just Smithfield. He wanted to make sure that Clubs New South Wales continued to make its outstanding contribution to communities across the country.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I did want to take these few moments to record in the parliament my personal condolences and I am sure the condolences of all members for Stanley Anderson. I extend our condolences to his wife Barbara, whom I telephoned yesterday. I know that she is going through a great period of loss, but she has much to be proud of in her contribution with Stan and the contribution that her family has made. My best wishes go to Stan and Barbara's children, Scott and Robyn—Scott followed Stan into the New South Wales Police Service—and to their grandchildren, Jessica and Mark, Dale, Travis and Cooper. They were proud of all their grandchildren, and proud when Dale became captain of Smithfield Public School a couple of years ago. I was captain of Smithfield Public School in 1984, and I had a number of chats with the Anderson family about Dale's role as captain of Smithfield Public School, and I was pleased on my visits there to see him fulfilling that role very well. I extend my condolences—Stan Anderson will be missed; may he rest in peace.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Forde</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">16:13</span>):  I rise to speak on education, which seems to be a common topic at the moment and a matter of great importance to all of us in this House. As usual it is the coalition side of politics that will ultimately provide the real answers and the real solutions. It is interesting that the government sought to hold the Gonski education forum in my electorate last week, hosted by the member for Rankin, Mr Emerson, along with the Minister for School Education—the member for Kingsford-Smith, Mr Garrett. The event was held at Marsden State High School. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I am sure many of my constituents would have been very interested to find out more about Labor's plans for education, but a forum during the middle of the day does not really work that well for most working parents and teachers in my electorate. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">From what I hear they did not miss out on much. They did not miss out on hearing about how the government plan to fund the proposed $6.5 billion a year increase from 2014, because they did not have an answer for that except to say that they will find it somewhere in the magic never-never. They also did not explain how much extra, given the announcements this week, will be required on top of that $6.5 billion to implement the latest addition to Labor's education crusade, or revolution or whatever you want to call it, to fund the implementation of the government's Asian language policy.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I think it is a very relevant question for everybody in our community: where will the money be found? It certainly does not exist in the Mid-Year Economic and Fiscal Outlook. Ironically, this update only shows that the government will cut or delay around $2.4 billion in education programs. This is a government that parades around talking about its commitment to education, but has just announced billions of dollars of cuts. For example, it announced a delay of $175 million from the National Partnership for Teacher Quality that would have gone to the states next year. Another $304 million has been cut from trade training centres as the program is further delayed and only 208 of the 2,650 promised centres have been finalised.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Students at these schools will be the ones paying for Labor's education point-scoring match when they inherit the debt of this Labor government when they enter the workforce. My constituents deserve to know where the money will be coming from to fund education. That is what they want; not a form in the middle of the day full of spin and political campaign fodder.</span>

Today I rise to inform the House that I have collected over 1,300 signatures from people in the Geelong area and surrounds demanding that the state government stop their reckless cuts to the TAFE sector in Victoria, particularly Gordon TAFE that services the Geelong community and surrounds. These cuts will devastate training and skills in the Geelong region with, potentially, up to 43 courses being shut and the end to VET training in our schools. The Gordon TAFE has delivered the VET in Schools program for almost 20 years across the Geelong area, with more than 1,000 students from 28 secondary schools taking part in this year alone. The Liberal Party's cuts to VET training will disadvantage students who wish to take up vocational training opportunities rather than, perhaps, taking the opportunity of going to university.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The Geelong community simply will not accept these TAFE cuts that have been announced by the Victorian state government. All people in the Geelong area, one way or another, have a very strong connection to the Gordon TAFE college. This is an institution that has been providing training opportunities for Geelong people for more than 125 years. It is an institution that the Geelong community is very proud of, and I am certainly prepared to work very closely with the Geelong community to hold the Victorian state government to account for these TAFE cuts.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Last week I had the opportunity to present these petitions, with over 1,300 signatures, to my state parliamentary colleague in the area, Gayle Tierney, who will be presenting them to the Victorian parliament in the coming weeks. I thank her also for showing her support to the TAFE college, for those that work within the institution and for young people that continue to be educated by this very fine institution. Ted Baillieu must stop these TAFE cuts.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Swan</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">16:19</span>):  On 4 October the shadow minister for ageing and mental health, Senator Fierravanti-Wells, visited my electorate of Swan to meet with the aged-care sector and discuss pressures on the aged-care industry. It was a productive meeting, and I thank the shadow minister for making the trip over to Western Australia to meet with my constituents and providers. Many of the participants in the forum were not from management but actual front-line staff who work each day on the coalface and feel the effects of poor government management.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">According to the Department of Finance and Deregulation, the costs of providing aged care are predicted to double in the next 40 years. Australians are living longer and creating an ageing population which is, in my view, the biggest social issue facing Australia and of key importance to this and future governments. To give an insight into the scope of this challenge, it is over-85-year-olds who are the main users of the aged-care services, and these will increase from 400,000, or 1.7 per cent of the total population, in 2007 to 1.6 million, or 5.6 per cent, by 2047. It is clear that we need to provide the most advantageous environment possible to the providers if they are to thrive and meet the future challenges of providing services to our communities. Not only is the ageing population resulting in potentially unsustainable increased costs as we age, but we have more complex health conditions and changing disease patterns, resulting in increasing and changed aged-care needs. I have particular interest in this area—as you do, Mr Deputy Speaker Georganas; you are the chair and I am the deputy chair of the House of Representatives Standing Committee on Health and Ageing, and we have both spoken many times since entering this parliament on the challenges that the community faces in these areas.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">If there is one thing that I took from the meeting, it was the view that, whilst plenty of noise has been made in Canberra, what actually matters to those running these organisations and those on the coalface is that we formulate policies that can actually be delivered. Until there is a proper structural reform of the aged-care sector, the care and wellbeing of senior Australians is and will continue to be at risk. Despite promises for reform, five years on there is very little evidence of real change on the ground. Labor has failed to deliver on promises and refuses to make the hard decisions. As is common with this government, it undertook a litany of reports and reviews but very little action has been achieved. The coalition has been calling on the government for much-needed reform for some time, and at the last election we set out our framework for real reform through the first ever four-year aged-care provider agreement with the sector, including consideration of the Productivity Commission report. In closing, the industry and clients that I have met all want 100 per cent of the Productivity Commission report implemented, not just the five per cent the Labor government is introducing.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Reid</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">16:22</span>):  Shortly the United Nations First Committee will consider a resolution calling on nations to take a precautionary approach to the use of depleted uranium weapons. The resolution calls for greater transparency in the use of depleted uranium weapons so that user nations reveal where they have been used so local communities are aware they may be affected. In line with representations made to me by my constituents, I urge the Minister for Foreign Affairs to support a yes vote on this resolution aimed at protecting civilians from long-term harm.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Depleted uranium, or DU, has been used in conventional weapons since 1991 because of its armour-piercing capabilities. It is radioactive, chemically toxic, carcinogenic and genotoxic. About 700 tonnes of DU has been dispersed in Iraq, affecting soldiers and civilians and contaminating land. There was a sharp increase in cancers and child deformities in Iraq after 1991 and after 2003. I have met Donna Mulhearn, an Australian campaigner who has witnessed firsthand the impact of DU on human health when living and working in Iraq. The greatest victims are women, children and the unborn, as well as entire communities struggling to use land for agriculture in a toxic ecosystem.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I note that the Australian Defence Force does not use depleted uranium and holds no stocks of depleted uranium provisions, nor does the government allow other states to use depleted uranium on Australian territory. The Australian Defence Force and the government are wise to take such a precautionary approach considering the well-documented hazards of DU weapons. It would therefore be consistent to extend this precaution to assist civilian communities caught up in conflicts where DU weapons are used.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">This concept of simply requiring greater transparency regarding the location of DU weapons is at the heart of the upcoming UN First Committee resolution; therefore, supporting it would be consistent with the cautious approach already taken by the Australian Defence Force and the Australian government. Further, I note that the December 2010 agreement between the government of Australia and the government of the United States of America concerning peaceful uses of nuclear energy specifies that Australian uranium not be used for DU munitions. This is a significant and intentional inclusion and again reflects the precautionary approach taken by the Australian government in relation to depleted uranium weapons. This agreement was signed after the previous First Committee vote two years ago, at which Australia abstained. To be consistent with this precautionary approach, it is logical that Australia would change its vote from abstaining to voting yes.  </span>

On Friday night, I attended the 2012 Territory Research and Innovation Awards with my friend and colleague, the amazing Alison Anderson, who is the new Minister for Regional Development and Indigenous Advancement in the new Northern Territory Country Liberals government, along with another friend and colleague of mine the member for Sanderson, Mr Peter Styles. It was great to see so many innovators on the night. </span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The winner of the Minister for Business Innovation Award was Mike Crowe, from Desert Knowledge Australia. The winners of the Menzies School of Health Research and Desert Knowledge Research Award were Fiona Walsh, Josie Douglas and members of the (Food from the Creation Time) Reference Group. The winner of the Southern Cross Television Tropical Knowledge Research Award was Professor Stephen Grant from Charles Darwin University. The winner of the McArthur River Mining Indigenous Innovation Award was Anne Hanning from the Menzies School of Research. The winner of the Charles Darwin New Generation Award was Donna Lewis from the Department of Land Resource Management. The final award for the evening was the Tall Poppy Award, which was won by Dr Jaquelyne Hughes from the Menzies School of Health Research. I would like to congratulate all of those innovators. </span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">On Saturday night, 27 October, I attended the Australian Institute of Management's Northern Territory 2012 Management Excellence Awards. The member for Drysdale, Lia Finocchiaro, and the member for Sanderson also attended the event. This event is great because it recognises the contribution of a range of managers throughout the Territory who have a real capacity to lead and inspire others. The Young Manager of the Year winner was Amelia Moloney from Apprenticeships Plus. Owner Manager of the Year was Amalie Andropov, who is the Managing Director of the Territory Medical Group. The Non-for-Profit Manager of the Year was Alexia Hohipa, who is the CEO of YMCA Top End. The Professional Manager of the Year was Mark Moller from Commonwealth Bank. And the Professional Manager of the Year for public service was Noelene Swanson, who was the Executive Director, Territory Housing Development and Operations for the Department of Housing, Local Government and Regional Services. She has recently joined the new Country liberals Territory government as an adviser. </span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">
                  <a href="HWR" type="MemberSpeech">
                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Ms PARKE</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Fremantle</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">16:28</span>):  Today I want to mark a sad occasion and pay tribute to the Deckchair Theatre Company, which has announced that it will be closing its doors after more than 30 years of operation. Its 'end of an era' party will be held this Friday, 2 November. Deckchair, as it is known to so many people in Fremantle, is a cultural icon in Fremantle and has contributed significantly to the artistic vitality and diversity of the community through its production of theatrical performances and through its related development programs for emerging performers and writers.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Founded in 1983, the Deckchair Company is based in the heart of Fremantle at Victoria Hall and, in the past 30 years, has delivered a number of memorable and high quality Australian theatre pieces. Indeed, since opening its doors, the company has premiered over 100 multi-award winning plays to audiences locally. Some of these productions have gone on to appear before audiences across Australia and around the world. Memorable performances that I have attended in recent times have included <span style="font-style:italic;">The Danger Age</span>, <span style="font-style:italic;">Taking </span><span style="font-style:italic;">L</span><span style="font-style:italic;">iberty</span>, <span style="font-style:italic;">Krakouer</span>, and the <span style="font-style:italic;">Modern International Dead</span>, the latter of which was a play about UN peacekeeping which had a powerful impact on me, personally. Deckchair's recent production of <span style="font-style:italic;">The Fremantle Candidate </span>presented an illuminating and poignant snapshot of a critical time in the life and career of former federal member for Fremantle, the great John Curtin.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Along with a long list of inspiring performances, Deckchair throughout its history has played an important role in nurturing new talent through its mentoring programs for aspiring thespians. The playwrights in residency program has offered free mentoring and office space for young playwrights to produce original scripts with assistance from seasoned directors while the Umbrella Program has given emerging theatre groups a venue to perform original Australian works without the burden of overhead risks. The Emerging Artists Program has fostered many young and talented performers on to bigger and better things both at home in Australia and around the world.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The closure of these programs will be a great loss to the Western Australian theatre community and future generations of Western Australian artists. I would like to acknowledge the incredible work of artistic director Chris Bendall. He has given enormously of himself, his talent and his energy over the last few years and he has done so with the assistance of a great board but under difficult and unstable circumstances. Chris Bendall's clarity, creativity and steadiness of vision has seen the production of works of great and distinctive artistic merit and brought original work into the world that has affected people and will stay with them, as art does.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Chris commented recently that, while the journey ends, the story continues through the staff, artists and crew. It is clear that all who have worked with Deckchair feel a deep affinity for the work they have undertaken. Indeed, they should be proud of their achievements. Deckchair is a theatre company of national significance and international quality. It is a terrible shame it has to close.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I want to conclude by thanking everyone who has made this wonderful theatre company a success for so many years. I sincerely hope that one day we may see it reopen its doors in one form or another.</span>

                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">
                    <a href="IYU" type="MemberSpeech">
                      <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Mr BRIGGS</span>
                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Mayo</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">16:31</span>):  I rise today to respond on the opposition's behalf and on behalf of the member for Stirling, the relevant shadow minister who is not here this week. He is at home with his new baby, Theodore. We congratulate him on that achievement.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The Crimes Legislation Amendment (Serious Drugs, Identity Crime and Other Measures) Bill 2012 contains a range of measures to improve Commonwealth criminal justice arrangements, including amendments to ensure that the Commonwealth serious drug offences framework can respond quickly to new and emerging substances, expand the scope of existing identity crime offences as well as enact a new offence for the use of a carriage service in order to obtain and/or deal with identification information. The bill aims to create new offences relating to air travel and the use of false identities. There are minor amendments to improve the operation of the Law Enforcement Integrity Commissioner Act 2006. The bill contains a technical amendment to clarify that superannuation orders can be made in relation to all periods of a person's employment as a Commonwealth employee not only the period in which a corruption offence occurred. The bill makes amendments to increase the value of a penalty unit and introduce a requirement for the triennial review of the penalty unit.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The measures have for the most part been swept into the one bill as a housekeeping exercise to ensure that Commonwealth criminal law is improved and clarified. The coalition support the bill in principle; however, we believe it is important for the bill to be thoroughly examined by the Senate Legal and Constitutional Affairs Legislation Committee due to the wide-ranging nature of the proposed amendments to the criminal law.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I turn now to schedule 1 of the bill, the purpose of which is to strengthen the Commonwealth serious drug offences framework. Illicit drugs have a serious impact on the Australian community and cause a wide range of social, economic and personal harms. The bill's explanatory memorandum states that the amendments in this schedule ensure that Commonwealth laws are up-to-date and allow for flexible quick responses to new and emerging drug threats, such as substances that seek to mimic the effect of other illicit drugs. This amendment will transfer the list of substances to which the Commonwealth's serious drug offences apply from the Criminal Code to the Criminal Code Regulations 2002, establish conditions and criteria for listing controlled and border controlled substances in regulations, improve emergency determination mechanisms by extending the listing period and refine the criteria that must be satisfied before a determination can be made.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The Australian Customs and Border Protection Service are responsible for managing the security and integrity of Australia's borders, including the detection of illicit drugs and other contraband. Customs officers work hard, day and night, to detect and deter unlawful movement of goods and people across the border. Australian Customs officers do a great job under tough circumstances, particularly considering the damaging staff and budgetary cuts that this Labor government has inflicted on them. Unfortunately, they are also being stretched due to the government's mismanagement of Australia's borders.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Since coming to office five years ago, Labor has cut funding to Customs for cargo screening, making Australia's borders less secure and our nation more vulnerable to the threat of illicit drugs. In the 2009-10 budget, Labor cut the budget for Customs for cargo screening by $58.1 million. This cut to screening by the Rudd-Gillard government reduced the number of potential sea cargo inspections by 25 per cent. Labor's cuts also resulted in a reduction of 75 per cent of air cargo inspections. In the recent Customs annual report it was revealed that only 4.3 per cent of sea cargo is X-rayed and only 0.6 per cent of sea cargo is physically examined. It was also concerning to find out that a staggering 95 per cent of all sea cargo consignments are not X-rayed. We on this side of the House care very deeply about Customs issues, as do many people in Western Sydney.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">It is no wonder illicit drugs are slipping through onto our streets under Labor, when only 13.3 per cent of air cargo consignments are X-rayed and only 0.6 per cent of air cargo is physically examined. That means that 86.7 per cent of all air cargo consignments are not X-rayed. What has become quite clear is that Labor's cuts to Customs cargo and vessels inspection systems put Australians at risk by giving a boost to organised criminal gangs that smuggle illicit drugs and weapons into this country. This Labor government prefers to tinker around the edges rather than ensuring our law enforcement agencies are appropriately resourced to perform their tasks.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I turn now to the serious growing threat of identity crime. Schedule 2 aims to expand identity crime offences in the Criminal Code Act 1995 and to create new offences and powers relating to air travel and the use of false identities. Law enforcement agencies, such as the Australian Federal Police, have identified identity crime as a significant threat to Australians and have identified it as one of the fastest growing crime types in Australia. Australians have been quick to adopt the internet in their lives and businesses. For many Australians, it is now part of their daily routine for talking to friends and family, studying, shopping and paying bills. Similarly, businesses have embraced the internet and other information technology to improve efficiency, improve the quality of service and gain access to new markets. Regrettably, our use of the internet has also created new prospects for criminals who seek to access our personal and corporate secrets, steal our resources and intimidate internet reliant businesses.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Additionally, the global community continues to experience an increase in the scale, sophistication and successful penetration of cybercrime and identity theft. As the extent and the importance of electronic information has increased, so too have the efforts of criminals and other malicious actors who have adopted the internet as a more convenient, anonymous and profitable method of conducting their criminal activities. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">At this point I would like to acknowledge the good work of the Australian Federal Police and all that they do, along with their state and federal territory police forces. Again, it is unfortunate that this Labor government does not appreciate the key role that the AFP plays in protecting Australia's national security. Labor has cut a staggering $264.5 million from the AFP since it came to office, including $133 million in the 2012-13 budget.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The AFP's High Tech Crime Operations centre, led by Assistant Commissioner Neil Gaughan, does an outstanding job, considering the limited resources it has available and the constant evolution of the cyber threat.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I will now turn to the amendments within the bill that aim to help law enforcement agencies to fight these emerging cyber and identity crimes. This amendment serves to expand existing identity crime offences to include using identification information to commit foreign indictable offences, in addition to Commonwealth indictable offences. This will capture individuals who are located in Australia and who engage in international identity crime. It is no secret that the internet and other new technologies provide ideal vehicles for organised criminal syndicates to capture and exploit the identity information of others.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Part 1 of this schedule seeks to introduce a new offence of dealing in identity information using a carriage service such as the internet. This will capture individuals who use the internet to make, supply or use identification information with the intention of passing either themselves or someone else off as the person identified in the information for the purpose of committing an offence. Part 2 of schedule 2 includes amendments that are aimed at enabling law enforcement agencies to target individuals who travel by air under false identities. The aim is specifically to prevent individuals involved in organised crime from taking flights under false identities in order to commit or facilitate crimes and avoid police detection.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The coalition has long been of the view that more needs to be done on this front, including in our maritime and aviation sectors, which have been infiltrated by organised criminal networks. The Parliamentary Joint Committee on Law Enforcement held an inquiry into the adequacy of aviation and maritime security measures to combat serious and organised crime, and it reported in June 2011. The committee heard evidence that individuals involved in organised crime had regularly been travelling by air under false identities in order to avoid police detection in order to facilitate criminal activities such as money laundering and illicit drug trafficking. It is not currently an offence to use false information to travel by air. The committee recommended the creation of this new offence to reduce this vulnerability which is exploited by criminal networks.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This amendment will also give police officers the power to request identity information from individuals where the police officer holds a reasonable suspicion that the person has committed or intends to commit a serious criminal offence. The coalition supports measures that will thwart attempts by criminal syndicates to take advantage of lax conditions; however, it is unfortunate that it has taken the government almost a year and a half to act on these recommendations and respond accordingly.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Schedule 3 of the bill makes some technical amendments relating to the functions of the Law Enforcement Integrity Commissioner, the value of penalty units and superannuation orders. The bill makes wide-ranging changes across Commonwealth criminal law, largely to tighten and clarify existing laws. The bill also creates new offences for identity crimes, which need to be thoroughly examined by the Senate committee I mentioned earlier. The coalition reserves the right to move amendments in the Senate, pending the recommendations of that committee. I commend the bill to the House.</span>

                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Gellibrand</span>—<span class="HPS-MinisterialTitles">Attorney-General and Minister for Emergency Management</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">16:43</span>):  It is normal in the summing up speech to thank those who have contributed to the debate. I think that is a little difficult after the member for Mayo's contributions because they were, I have to say, a bit half-hearted in what is a serious piece of legislation. I certainly do not criticise the opposition's wanting to reserve its position following the Senate's committee process, because that is a normal step that can be taken for legislation. But I think to be rambling, quite frankly, about Customs cuts really does show—and I know that you are acting for the member for Stirling while he is on paternity leave—a lack of understanding that intelligence based screening is actually delivering better outcomes for identifying, through customs, prohibited goods being brought into Australia. Obviously that is also not especially relevant to the bill.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">But I am pleased that, in the middle of all of that, the member for Mayo made it clear that the substantive changes to the bill primarily modernise and tighten criminal legislation. It is important that we make sure we can quickly respond to the changing types of drugs being brought into the community. It is important that we deal with new offences, such as identify crime, which are becoming much more prevalent. That is what this bill seeks to do.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We know that organised criminals can adapt and change their behaviour to try and evade detection and escape prosecution. They can seek out loopholes and turn to new and different ways to prey on their victims—be that through seeking out new drugs to import, developing more sophisticated financial fraud or exploiting the opportunities the internet provides to facilitate identity fraud. Our response has been to provide law enforcement with the tools to respond quickly to these emerging trends now and into the future. That is exactly what this bill does, as well as providing for significant increases in the financial penalties for those offences. I commend the bill to the House.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Kooyong</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">16:46</span>):  As I was saying yesterday, the 10th anniversary of the Bali bombing is something we should all commemorate. Through the initiatives of people on both sides of this House, we have done much to stamp out terrorism, both at home and abroad, and ensure that we never see a repeat of those events in Bali. As I said, one of the benefits, one of the small rays of light, that came out of the tragedy in October 2002 was the high degree of cooperation between Indonesia and Australia. We are not just neighbours; we are friends and we are partners in the fight against terrorism. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Susilo Bambang Yudhoyono, who was the security minister for Indonesia at the time of the Bali bombing and in 2004 became the President of Indonesia—and he got a second term, so he will be there until 2014—has worked with successive Australian governments in an effort to stamp out terrorism. I wanted to share a quote from Susilo Bambang Yudhoyono, President of Indonesia. He said:</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Small">The Bali bombings created a set of critical chain reactions.  The Bali bombings created a set of critical chain reactions. The public debate over whether terrorism was a real or imagined threat to Indonesia was laid to rest. We recognised that freedom, democracy and tolerance cannot be taken for granted.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">He also said:</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Small">The entire nation galvanised to defend freedom, democracy and tolerance. Internationally, Indonesia became a key player in the fight against terrorism. Indonesia also became an active proponent of interfaith cooperation.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">He went on to say:</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Small">The Bali attack was also a turning point in relations between Indonesia and Australia. Our relations with Australia suffered challenges brought forth by the events in East Timor. It produced a compelling reason for Jakarta and Canberra to explore new ways of cooperation in a world haunted by new, unfamiliar threats. The Bali bombings cemented an emotional connection between Indonesia and Australia. A connection that grew stronger following the tsunami tragedy in Aceh and Nias, and the development of the Comprehensive Partnership and Lombok Treaty. As we remember 10 years since the Bali bombings, our thoughts are with those who have endured the terrible loss of their loved ones.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">That was Susilo Bambang Yudhoyono, the President of Indonesia, who put it so succinctly, saying that in the days, the weeks, the months and the years after the tragedy of the Bali bombings our two countries have come together in a way that is unprecedented to fight a common enemy. Indonesia looked within itself and saw the radical elements of Islam: the Noordin Tops, the Mukhlas, the Samudras, the Abu Bakar Bashirs of this world, who conspired to kill 88 innocent Australians and 202 people representing countries as diverse as the Europeans, the Americans and other countries in our region. That is what they did. They ruined the innocence of hundreds of Australians and many others around the world, but they do not have and have not had the last say. The people who have had the last say are the survivors and the families of the victims, who have committed to go forward with courage from this day and to ensure that the memories continue and that the lives lost on that tragic night in October 2002 were not lost in vain.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We, both in the time of the Howard government and in the coalition since then, with our colleagues across the political divide, have worked in a considered and concerted manner to tackle terrorism at its source, to fund our law enforcement agencies and to do better at the cutting edge of the fight against terrorism. So, as we look back on those tragic events, we can say that, as a result of what happened in the nightclub district of Bali in 2002, we have bonded together and we have made a difference to ensure that the world is a safer place for Australians and our other friends in the world.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Higgins</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">16:52</span>):  On Friday, 12 October, we commemorated with great sadness one of the darkest days in Australian history—a specific moment in time when the people of Australia were attacked, albeit in a foreign land, and when the people of Australia realised that we are not immune from extremism and some of the more horrific aspects of human nature. On 12 October 2002, Australia lost its innocence in what was and to this day still is the worst terrorist attack in our short history. Eighty-eight Australians were slain in the most random and brutal way. What was meant to be a joyous and cheerful time in people's lives as they shared vacation time with family and friends in the tropical oasis of Bali turned into a nightmare as three bombs went off in a coordinated and sinister attack throughout Kuta and at the United States consulate in Denpasar. In these attacks, 202 innocent people lost their lives, including, as I have mentioned, 88 Australians in a deliberate plan to cause as much damage as possible, a single backpack-laden suicide bomber entered Paddy's nightclub and, without warning, detonated the explosive. This in turn had people flooding into the street to try and avoid the chaos and confusion. As they ran for what they thought was safety, a second, larger car bomb was detonated outside the Sari Club across the road. The devastation was endless and the destruction was horrific. We remember in this place those that lost their lives. We grieve with their families and we honour those who came to their aid. The pain and mental anguish of those who survived is immense and enduring.</span>

At 11.09pm on October the 12th 2002 we were at the Sari Club having been in Bali for less than 12 hours. Life and the World changed forever. I had travelled to Bali with a group of 19 mates from The Kingsley Football Club in Western Australia on a end of season trip. Only 13 returned. I was 44 years old and had a life time of experiences and memories. 5 young men had yet to see their 21st birthday.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I think we in this place have a duty to provide a small gesture to them and their surviving families, and I think a small amount of compensation is that appropriate gesture to help people get back on their feet. That is why we in the coalition have committed to support Australians who are victims of terrorist attacks overseas. A $75,000 payment brings them into line with the level of assistance provided to domestic victims of violent crime. We know that no amount of money can ever fully compensate for what these people have endured, but we hope that this gesture allows those in need to find some solace as they cope with the very significant changes in their lives that they never expected, as they need to continue to rebuild their lives.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">It is said that every cloud has a silver lining, and it often takes the worst in human nature to bring out the best in human behaviour. This was true in the case of the Bali bombings and those that responded. From the first emergency workers on the scene to the doctors who treated the many burns victims to the psychologists and counsellors who continue to this day to work with those affected, we saw the best in the Australian spirit and in the human spirit on show. The first people to arrive at the Sari Club risked their very lives to bring the injured and wounded to safety. Within 26 hours, the first patients arrived at the Royal Darwin Hospital. Sixty-one patients arrived at Darwin, and 48 were then taken throughout Australia to receive specialised services. We honour and thank those that worked so hard to save the lives of others—not just the Australians that responded but the Indonesians that responded as well. They came together in the spirit of solidarity.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We remember those that lost their lives, and we forever stay vigilant to rid the world of violent extremism. Together Australia stands with Indonesia against violent extremism, and we hope never to have to stand in this place and move such a condolence motion as this again.</span>

                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Mr WYATT</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Hasluck</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">17:02</span>):  I rise to talk on the Bali bombings. They are a point in Australia's history at which a traumatic event impacted on families, on individuals and on the psyche of Australia, because we had never experienced such a traumatic event in the way that it transpired on Friday, 12 October 2002 at 11.05. It will always be remembered, like the assassination of John F Kennedy or September 11. We will always remember where we were, what we were doing, how the visual images in the breaking of that news story impacted on us, and our reactions of disbelief at seeing the carnage that was a result of the event.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">At the time my wife and I were in Caporio in Italy. We had just sat down to lunch with Antonio and Concerta, two of her cousins, and their family. We were having a discussion, and while we were talking Italian news broke the story. It led with 'Australians killed in Bali', and we stopped the conversation and tuned into the television. What we saw was footage that we could not believe happening in Bali, and the Italians that we were with said, 'Why would anybody want to do this to Australians?' Then it came out that there were Italians affected as well. We had a discussion at that point about the senseless slaughter of people. The loss of life because of extremists was something that was hard to comprehend, particularly when you know that all of those there were holidaying and it was something that they were looking forward to.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The disbelief, though, I think was a significant factor for us around that table. Later on that night we sat and watched the news again and rang home to see if any family members had been affected—or friends or people that we knew. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We came back fairly soon after that event. We came through Singapore and gleaned news items that we happened to see. The media coverage was very explicit on the impact that it had on those who had gone there for a good time. I always remember reading those articles, looking at explicit nature of the events as they occurred—the footage and photographs. I could not comprehend the damage to another human being in the way that I saw. I understand there are conflicts where there are battles and wars that are fought and the weaponry that is used, but not in terms of innocent people. To see that brought back the reality that the world was changing.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I watched coverage by Nick Ray, who was working for one of the commercial stations—I am not sure which channel—and his comments after filing some stories,. Him then saying, 'I find this extremely challenging,' looking at limbs separated from bodies, bodies that were not recognisable. There is one  thing that I always think about in terms of the Bali bombing—it does not matter when the context is; I think it was brought home very sharply with the memorial service held here in the parliament, when Professor Fiona Wood made her profound comments about the humanity of goodness in a time of crisis and in a time of need. It was her comments about the resilience of individuals. She spoke of a particular person who she said had serious burns. But the thing that struck her was the hope and aspirations of that individual. She said that the person eventually recovered and she challenged them in a sporting event. She got beaten but what she liked was the fact of the resilience and the recovery.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Fiona, who I know personally and have worked with and enjoyed her professional approach to much in the health area, was quite affected by those who she saw with the degrees of burns that people experienced. She was affected by the stories that were shared with her about those who were affected and hospitalised—both in Perth and Darwin—about the way in which heroism was extremely noticeable. It was evident in the way in which, at a time of confusion and in a time of your world being turned upside down, individuals looked around to see who needed help and those that they were able to help, they took them to the nearest medical facility or they stayed with them until help arrived. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The thing that was even more amazing was the way in which health professionals—medical specialists, those who specialise in burns, those surgeons that were needed, the allied health professions that became involved, the nurses who gave their time—Australians and Indonesians, worked together to ensure that those who had been injured were given every level support and assistance.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Then came the second phase after evacuation and after treatment—that is, the trauma that individuals experience. Here it was the psychologists, psychiatrists and the counsellors that were needed to help people through something that, in a sense, you would not comprehend, because it was something that you would not then be prepared for nor had you ever anticipated occurring to you. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Then I looked with great pride at fellow Australians who gave their time to work closely with the Indonesians in Bali—the Australian Federal Police in the identification of people, and those who assisted to ensure that family members who were killed were brought back to Australia.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">One point that always stuck out in that list of people that were killed—the 202 of which 88 were Australians and 38 were Indonesians—was this. At the bottom of the list there were two who were never identified and were cremated in Bali. I always thought, 'I wonder whose family was affected. Did they ever know that those two, who were family members, would never return back to where they had come from?'</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I admire the resilience of those affected, because all of them have got on with their lives. When we saw a photographic display of those who had lost lives and when we saw family members put flowers on the wreath of flowers in the Great Hall, we could see their emotion but we also saw their resilience and acceptance, that they were still acknowledging somebody that they had lost.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The attack involved the detonation of three bombs, but I note in particular the two which inflicted the terrible loss of life: a backpack mounted device carried by a suicide bomber and a large car bomb, which were both detonated within 20 seconds of each other. They would have created, in anybody's mind, a considerable level of confusion because any explosion near you disorients you. If you are directly affected then you have this double impact, so the surrealness versus the reality of what you experience becomes a challenge but your survival hopes kick in.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I note the way in which we responded, in partnership with the Indonesians, was incredible when you give consideration to the logistics of responding to such an event. When I saw the photographs and the images, both electronically and in media stories, I noted the damage was immense, with the scorching of the earth, with the glass that would have flown, with the impact on buildings several blocks away a reality jolt of the brutality that was inflicted by people who set out to kill innocent holidaymakers, people who had no regard for the fact that they were not involved in their war of terror. What they should have done was look at other opportunities of expressing their dissatisfaction than to take the lives of family members.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">When you looked at the hospital facilities that were available then in Bali, you saw they were not adequate. I am reminded in memory of the number of people who had severe burns and were taken to buildings around there that had swimming pools in which people could immerse those people with serious burns to alleviate their pain. Then I am reminded of the memories of reading newspaper articles about people who then went looking for family members and who knew that they were missing but did not know where they were and about the experience that they went through.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">But the plus out of all of this is that Australia committed resources to provide in Bali a hospital that would enable future people that required treatment to have access to good services. Additionally, Professor Fiona Wood and those within Darwin worked together to create two units that in the future would serve Australians well and also others who would need any specialised treatment. I think the thing that was important for all of us was the fact that we had given a special place to all of those who were affected through the memorials that had been established, here in Canberra and other parts of Australia and certainly in Bali.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">As a mark of respect, a permanent memorial was built on the site of the destroyed Paddy's Pub on Legian Street. The memorial is made of intricately carved stone, set with a large marble plaque which bears the names and nationalities of each of those killed. It is flanked by the national flags of the victims. The monument is well maintained and illuminated at night. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I could spend time talking about the perpetrators, but I do not intend to do that. I want to remember those families who suffered the loss of a son, a daughter, a mother, a brother. In Perth, the memorial at Kings Park lists the WA victims of the bombing. It was opened on the first anniversary and is situated on the ridge of Mount Eliza in Kings Park, overlooking the city. The memorial is specifically designed to frame the sun's rays at dawn on 12 October each year, and it faces in the exact direction of Bali. The family names on there reflect the diversity, in a sense, of those families affected. The Kingsley Football Club, which had a number of members killed in the Bali bombings, had in it kids from an area that I taught in. My sons were friends of some of those footballers. When I rang home from Italy I was talking to my youngest son and I asked him whether he knew anybody and he said yes, and he said some of the people from the Kingsley Football Club were schoolmates. I want to acknowledge what the member for Cowan, Luke Simpkins, said yesterday when he spoke of the Kingsley Football Club and the way in which they have dedicated both their memories and an area to the young men. He spoke of the club and the young men who died—Dean Gallagher, Byron Hancock, Corey Paltridge, David Ross, Anthony Stewart, Jason Stokes and Jonathon Wade. Inside the clubroom, under the sign for the boys, there is a memorial room for the seven footballers who went to Bali on 12 October 2002 with 13 of their best mates, and they died that night. In the Kuta Beach nightclub district they were celebrating reaching their first grand final when a backpack bomb that went off in Paddy's Bar and a massive car bomb outside the Sari Club destroyed seven of them. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The bonds between Indonesia and Australia, and our joint approach on terrorism and our combined efforts with other nations to tackle terrorist groups who inflict injury on innocent people and families, has been heightened and strengthened over that period of time. Our commitment and resolve to never allow any terrorist group or group of extremists to affect our way of life, our beliefs and our compassion about what we stand for and what we are as a nation will never change. But I hope we never again see something of the magnitude of what occurred in Bali.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I acknowledge all of the families affected, and certainly acknowledge every Australian who contributed to the efforts at that time and our service men and women and the police forces who in the future will continue to ensure that we are protected and accorded the safety that is important to us as a nation of people.</span>

                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Mr IRONS</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Swan</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">17:19</span>):  I rise to speak on the tragedy of the 2002 Bali bombings—a matter close to my heart. I have previously spoken on this topic, as have many of my colleagues. I am following the member for Higgins and the member for Hasluck, and I thank them for their contributions. These bombings were an event that had a profound impact on our national identity and one which Australians everywhere have managed to find inspiration and hope from amidst the pain and suffering. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">On Friday, 12 October 2012, Australians everywhere stopped to remember the tragic blasts that killed over 200 people, including 88 Australians, at the Sari Club in Kuta. As a country we were horrified that such a popular Australian tourist destination was the victim of barbaric terrorists with no regard for human life or for the livelihoods of the local Balinese. I recall the strength shown by former Prime Minister John Howard as he responded to his own and to the Australian people's outrage, loss and grief as we mourned the loss of those lives. Mr Howard used the tragedy as an opportunity for subsequent cooperation with Indonesia. In the aftermath he ensured that the world knew Australia would stand side-by-side with Indonesia in ensuring those responsible were brought to justice.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Australia's response to this tragedy was instantaneous. Our armed forces, police and medical professionals joined their Indonesian counterparts in providing on-the-ground support for the victims and families of those affected by the attacks. Over the following weeks the fledging partnership between Indonesia and Australia grew into a strong cooperation. Our armed forces assisted with the clean-up and with the provision of medical supplies. An initial medical team of seven doctors as well as nurses and surgeons worked from the ground in Bali to provide urgently needed medical treatment for the victims.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The bombings were an event that could have driven a wedge between Australian and Indonesian cooperation; instead our partnership strengthened. The partnership between our police forces and intelligence agencies was further strengthened. Immediately after the attack, Mick Keelty, Commissioner of the Australian Federal Police, began work with the Indonesian chief of police to ensure the safety of possible targets in Bali and to secure the apprehension of those responsible for these heinous attacks. It is in this spirit that Australians and Indonesians come together on 12 October every year, not just to remember and honour those who lost their lives in the Bali bombings, but to recognise and celebrate the joint achievements of our two nations and the ever-strengthening bonds we have between us.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">At 5 am on the morning of 12 October this year I had the privilege of joining the Western Australian Premier Colin Barnett, survivors, friends, families of victims and many other Western Australians in a moving dawn memorial service at Kings Park in Perth. This service honoured the courage of the survivors, friends and families of the victims as well as those volunteers who provided support and services in the aftermath of the attack. It was a cool morning and as the sun rose a lone piper walked down from the War Memorial towards the Bali Memorial at Kings Park. Premier Barnett gave his speech. It was simple, but straightforward and to the point. It was a moving speech, as were other parts of the ceremony, which had enormous effect on people in the crowd. The service even affected those who were participating in a traditional Perth morning ceremony of having a drink. That time of the morning is when you usually see some of the parents and footballers of the Kingsley Football Club. The service also had an enormous effect on my wife, Cheryl, who had never been to a Bali memorial service. Being with the families and survivors at the service brought tears to her eyes. I know some of the survivors from my electorate flew back to Bali for the ceremony. They were friends with my sister, who passed away in 2004. She had a close relationship with those survivors and I hope they had a great experience when they went back for the ceremony in Bali.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Ten years on it is inspiring to see how far all those affected by this tragedy have come. The impact from many of those in my home state of Western Australia was devastating. Many Western Australian's often frequent Bali's warm welcoming shores and, naturally, many local families were affected. In all, 16 Western Australians were killed in the blasts and many more were injured, which had a devastating impact on the WA community. Western Australia was vital in providing assistance to those injured, with many receiving treatment in our hospitals due to close proximity of Perth to Bali. The efforts of Dr Fiona Wood, the Perth burns specialist, are well known and were instrumental in treating and saving the lives of many injured in the attacks. Dr Wood pioneered the revolutionary spray-on skin treatment that saved the lives of countless burns victims and provided hope around the world to many families affected.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The first face many people watched on the news coverage of the Bali bombings was that of Western Australian Peter Hughes.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">His swollen and badly burnt body resonated in the minds of viewers around the globe. Although badly injured, he was shown quietly telling rescuers to go and help others worse off than him, saying, 'Mate I’m OK, I’m doing OK—there's lots of people worse off than me.' </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Peter has recovered from the trauma of the Bali bombings and continues to run his own successful roofing business. He also established the Peter Hughes Burn Foundation, to see burns victims successfully transition back into active life after a burns injury, becoming burns survivors. With co-patron Professor Fiona Ward and Peter Overton, the Peter Hughes Burn Foundation works with burns victims to provide inspirational support and help them achieve their dreams. Peter is a shining example of the hope that can spring from tragedies such as the Bali bombings.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Ten years on, it is successes such as these that the Australian people and the international community can look to to provide inspiration, even in the face of tragedy. Who could ever forget the vision of Jason McCartney running out for his game in North Melbourne—an inspiration! So many good things have come out of the Bali bombings.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Before I conclude, I would like to take the opportunity to speak about an inspirational community organisation which began in Western Australia: the Bali Peace Park Association. It comprises survivors, supporters, friends and families of victims of the Bali bombings, which provides support for all those affected by the bombings. The organisation aims to establish a Peace Park Memorial on the site of the Sari Club, where the bombings occurred in 2002, where people may reflect upon and acknowledge the terrorist attack on 12 October 2002, along with all the acts of terror worldwide. The Bali Peace Park Association has the backing of the Australian state and federal governments, as well as the Indonesian government, and is currently engaged in negotiations to acquire the Sari Club site.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I met with the Governor of Bali, Governor Pastika, in Canberra, when the President of Indonesia came to Canberra. I had a meeting with him and I asked him to support the aims of the Bali Peace Park Association. He has been instrumental in helping and assisting that association. So I thank him for that.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The association has also developed the Beyond Bali Education Kit, which aims to use the tragedy of the Bali bombings to try to counter violent extremism and home-grown terrorism by educating high school students across Australia. In a positive move forward the experiences of the survivors, including Aussie Rules footballer Phil Britten and Balinese Muslim leader Haji Bambang, will be used in the educational kit available to all Australian high schools in 2013. The education package was developed by the Bali Peace Park and Curtin University, in my electorate of Swan, and was trialled in two Western Australian schools—Perth Modern School and the Australian Islamic College in Kewdale, which is also in my electorate. This fantastic initiative was made possible by a $55,000 grant from the federal Attorney-General's Building Community Resilience fund. It is a testament of the spirit and compassion of the Australian people who were able to turn around a horrific and shocking event such as the Bali bombings into a movement of peace, inspiration and renewed cooperation with one of our closest neighbours, Indonesia. May our strength and friendship continue to grow and thrive for many years to come. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">In finishing, I do support the call of the opposition leader—and we also heard from the member for Higgins—for compensation. You can never be compensated enough for anything like that but, at the same time, these people could use that compensation to get on with their lives and to assist them and their families in moving forward. </span>

I express my personal condolences and those of the entire Townsville community to his parents, Murray Smith and Katrina Patterson; his sister Roxanne; and his partner, Liv.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Townsville is the home of the largest defence base in the country. When someone in our military falls, we feel it—no matter where they are from or where they served. They are one of us. Scott Smith, you are a proud member of the ADF family. To be this man, you must be incredibly brave; you must push the envelope right to the edge. But you would never be foolhardy. To be this man, you have to trust your training and your mates. To be this man, you must realise that some may fall. To be this man, you have to know that it could be you. These men are out the front.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">As the member for Fadden so eloquently put it yesterday, others literally walk in his footsteps. That is what these guys do. They lead the way and clear a path so that others are safe. These men are highly trained. They are tough and highly professional. They possess skills and reflexes few of us will ever witness. He died among friends, protecting them. He died with his mates saying he was brave and strong. If I were the parent, brother or partner of someone killed in action, I could take very little comfort from this. But, as a citizen of Australia and my city's representative in the national parliament, I take huge pride in the fact that we have people like this in our midst. Scott Smith died too young and he will be missed. Lest we forget.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Higgins</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">17:31</span>):  I join with my colleague the member for Herbert in speaking with great sadness on the death of Corporal Scott James Smith. On Sunday, 21 October 2012, 24-year-old Corporal Scott James Smith was killed on his second tour of Afghanistan by an improvised explosive device. Australia has lost an exceptional soldier who possessed all of the qualities of a great leader. I wish to express my deepest sympathies to his partner, Liv; his parents Katrina Paterson and Murray Smith; his sister, Roxanne; his friends; and the fellow soldiers who knew and served alongside him.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Corporal Smith was a member of the Special Operations Task Group and was from the Special Operations Engineer Regiment based at Holsworthy Barracks in Sydney, New South Wales. Corporal Smith joined the Army in February 2006 and moved quickly up the ranks, proving to be a leader. He is described by his unit as a genuine, honest and dedicated member who was probably one of the best junior non-commissioned officers the unit has seen. Corporal Smith's family describe him as a man who lived life to its fullest, had a great sense of humour and loved being outdoors. He pursued many sports, such as cricket and waterskiing. He was the lovable character that held the family together. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">In addition to having been deployed twice to Afghanistan in 2010 and 2012, Corporal Smith also served in the Solomon Islands in 2006. Corporal Smith was awarded various honours, including the Afghanistan Campaign Medal, the Army Combat Badge and the Australian Defence Medal. The loss of Corporal Smith is indeed very sad. On Remembrance Day, in just a few weeks time, we will be honouring those who have given their lives for our country. It is a great tragedy that Corporal Smith's name will be amongst those.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Corporal Smith's death is again a terrible reminder to all Australians that our soldiers in Afghanistan work in an extremely dangerous and life-threatening environment on a daily basis. Their dedication, courage and sacrifice can never be taken for granted and we honour them for it. I offer again my sincerest condolences to his family, who will feel Corporal Smith's loss for their lifetime. We honour him. We honour them for their sacrifice. Lest we forget.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Lingiari</span>—<span class="HPS-MinisterialTitles">Minister for Veterans' Affairs, Minister for Defence Science and Personnel, Minister for Indigenous Health and Minister Assisting the Prime Minister on the Centenary of ANZAC</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">17:34</span>):  I thank the previous speaker for her contribution. I rise to associate myself with the remarks of the Prime Minister, the Minister for Defence, the Leader of the Opposition, the shadow ministers and all other members who have been involved in this expression of condolences to the family, friends and comrades of Corporal Scott James Smith. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Our thoughts and deep sympathy go out to his loved ones and to his family by choice, the Australian Defence Force. In particular, we send our condolences to those with whom he served alongside in Army Special Operations Engineer Regiment. Corporal Smith was a young man, just 24 years old. But, as we know, he was an experienced soldier, having spent seven years with the Army. He had already undertaken deployments to the Solomon Islands and had had one prior tour of Afghanistan. Among our elite forces he has been acknowledged as 'one of the best junior non-commissioned officers that the unit has seen'. That high praise from his peers and superiors, along with the many decorations he received during his too-brief career, show that he was a strong, smart and very committed professional soldier.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Behind the indescribable sadness for his family and friends, there should be pride for his service to our nation. I offer my deepest sympathies to his parents, Katrina and Murray, and to his sister, Roxanne. I also offer my thanks for raising a wonderful son. Scott was a young man who found his calling wearing this country's uniform. Thank you for the support you provided him to undertake a career of service. I would also like to express my sincere sadness and condolences to Corporal Smith's partner, Liv. I cannot imagine the pain she is going through, but she needs to know that the thoughts of our nation are with her.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">There was another family that knew Corporal Smith very well, his second family, as his family dubbed them: his comrades. Those he served alongside of are mourning the loss of one of their own, a man they described as 'genuine, honest and dedicated'. What goes unsaid, though, is that he was brave, capable and committed to serving his country. His death is being deeply felt across his unit and the Army more widely. Corporal Smith was tragically killed when an improvised explosive device detonated during a clearance operation in Afghanistan's Helmand region early this month. He is the 39th Australian killed in the ongoing conflict in Afghanistan. He is the 19th member of the Special Operations Task Group to make the ultimate sacrifice.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We acknowledge the burden borne by our special operations forces in Afghanistan. Their role in this conflict is intense and extremely dangerous. We know that the operation Corporal Smith was undertaking was critically important. We know that, through his operation, an estimated 100 improvised explosive devices and a bomb-making factory were destroyed. We know this was an important operation. IEDs are a terrible, indiscriminate weapon, deployed without thought about who they kill or maim. The destruction of this bomb-making factory will save many, many more lives, including the lives of Australian and allied forces, Afghan civilians, women and children who can be caught in IED blasts.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Australia's mission in Afghanistan is ongoing and our commitment remains strong. That strength comes in no small part from the dedication, drive and professionalism of our forces on the ground. Our men and women in Afghanistan know that the work they are doing. What they are fighting for is a young nation to stand strong and resist terrorist forces intent on plying their evil trade. As the Minister for Defence pointed out, we will not be in Afghanistan forever. Work towards transitioning Afghan-led security in Uruzgan is on track. We have also been a nation that sees these things through and gets the job done. We are a nation that honours its fallen by finishing what we have started. All Australians owe our forces who serve in Afghanistan, who have served in Afghanistan, those who continue to fight and, sadly, those who have been lost in the conflict an incredible debt of gratitude.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Corporal Scott James Smith will have his name added to the Roll of Honour on the Australian War Memorial. His sacrifice will be remembered forever, alongside 102,000 others who have given their all in Australia's name. Lest we forget.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Greenway</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">17:39</span>):  I rise to add my voice to this motion of condolence on the unfortunate and untimely death of Corporal Scott James Smith. I note that it was at age 24, certainly so young for a life to be taken. I cannot remember what I was doing at age 24 but I certainly was not serving my country in the way that Corporal Scott James Smith did and I think none of us in this place probably were. It is something that I do not think you are prepared for when you go into parliament for the first time and I note some of my colleagues opposite are relatively new, like me, and I do not think they prepare us for the sadness that we feel in having to listen to yet another condolence motion being moved on the death overseas of another one of our finest. But I think I certainly speak for all here when I say that his life and certainly his death would not have been in vain.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">As has been mentioned, Corporal Scott James Smith is our 39th Australian soldier killed in Afghanistan. A corporal with the special forces combat engineers, he grew up in the Barossa Valley but was more recently based in Holsworthy. By the age of 24, at his death, he had already been honoured with many awards including the Australian Active Service Medal with Clasp International Coalition Against Terrorism; the Afghan Campaign Medal; the Australian Service Medal with Clasp Solomon Islands; the Australian Service Medal with Clasp—Counter Terrorism/Special Recovery; the Australian Defence Medal; the NATO International Stabilisation Assistance Force Medal with Multi-Tour Indicator 2; the Army Soldiers Medallion; the Army Combat Badge and the Returned from Active Service Badge. It is important that these awards be mentioned because I think it says something of the character of a person that by such a young age they could have amassed so many well deserved honours.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">There is really nothing that can speak greater about the life of Corporal Scott James Smith than the statement that was given by his family which I was extremely touched by when I read it. I think it duly honours them to have it read in to the <span style="font-style:italic;">Hansard</span><span style="font-style:italic;">. </span>His family said:</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Small">Scott was a tremendous soldier. It is openly acknowledged that he was well respected within his workplace and by those who knew him. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Small">We knew the Army was Scott’s second family, his home away from home. Scott truly believed his actions made a difference; he was a truly dedicated soldier, who also knew how to relax in his time away from work.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Small">Scott lived life to the fullest. He was born in the Barossa Valley and was water skiing as soon as he could stand—it was one of his great loves.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Small">Scott attended school in the local area and used his school holidays to learn to barefoot water ski. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Small">Liv, Scott's German princess, met him when she was an exchange student in Australia. After that, the pair could be found in all sorts of mischief together. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Small">Scott loved being outdoors and keeping fit throughout his lifetime and pursued many sports—from long distance running, to cricket and any sort of competition he could be involved in.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Small">Scott had a great sense of humour and was very much into practical jokes. He could also be very relaxed when not at work—becoming renowned for his cheeky smile and kind words.  But mostly Scott will always be renowned for being the loveable character that held the family together.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Small">Scott had a lot of time for those who had time for him, and his generosity in all things was often spoken about. One of the things you could rely on Scott for was calling whenever he was able and was thinking of you, at midday, midnight, or anywhere in between. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Small">Scott had a larrikin charm that endeared him to all those around him, and these qualities ensure he will always be held in the hearts of those who knew him.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Small">Our family is united in grief as we try to come to terms with our loss.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Small">We thank everyone for their heartfelt wishes and messages of condolences, but ask that our privacy be respected during this difficult time.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I have discussions with people in the community and colleagues here about the mission in Afghanistan and now and then I come across incidents which remind us of why we are there and why and how Australians are making a difference. I think of all the issues that we can single out the treatment of women and girls in Afghanistan by both the community and by the legal system is one that is a stand-out in terms of us making a difference. Also, it highlights the difference that we need to keep making. I would like to quote Cynthia Dill, a human rights lawyer who wrote recently in the <span style="font-style:italic;">Huffington Post</span> an article, 'The Taliban Attack: Why Women's Issues Are A Top Global Concern'. I will quote some of this article, which talks in particular about 14-year-old Malala Yousafzai, who has been called a 'peace icon' for her tireless activism for the rights of women and girls. It reads:</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Small">How far will the Taliban go to silence the voices of women and girls?</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Small">How far will its hatred extend to destroy any advances given to women and girls under the banner of freedom and liberty, in the name of basic human rights?</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Small">The world learned the answer this week.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Small">And it was appalled by the savagery.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Small">In cold blood, in a planned political assassination, a Taliban extremist shot and wounded a young teenager activist in Pakistan, targeting her for holding Western views.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The young girl, 14-year-old Malala Yousufzai, who has been called a peace icon for her tireless activism, was brutally attacked during the day while sitting on a school bus. The attacker asked for her by name and then shot her in the head. She was critically injured. I think it is fair to say, as highlighted by the <span style="font-style:italic;">Guardian </span>in an article by Emma Graham-Harrison, that ongoing slaughter is occurring at the behest of Taliban commanders in Afghanistan. The article reads: </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Small">The Taliban have killed 17 civilians—reportedly by cutting their throats—in a remote and violent corner of Afghanistan's Helmand province that government officials admit is entirely beyond their control.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Small">The reason for the slaughter was variously given as a fight between two Taliban commanders over women, Taliban anger over a music and dance party, or an insurgent crackdown on suspected government informers</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I think it is fair to say that these were the things that Corporal Scott James Smith would have known that he and his unit were fighting for. I think these ideals are ones which he as a soldier, one of the best of the best, would have held very closely to his heart. Although I did not know him, I admire him. I pay my deepest respects to his family on his loss and wish to record my deepest sorrow at the passing of someone who Australians can hold in the highest esteem, whose name will be added to that honour roll at the War Memorial. Lest we forget. </span>

I know that all our words are heartfelt as will be the words of those who will follow my speech about our fallen hero. </span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">There is a tremendous debt of gratitude and responsibility felt by parliamentarians for our service men and women who are actively engaged in operations overseas. Today, we mourn for and pay tribute to Corporal Scott James Smith from the Incident Response Regiment who was killed on 21 October 2012 while serving with the Special Operations Task Group in Afghanistan. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Corporal Smith was killed instantly by an improvised explosive device during a joint Australian-Afghan compound clearance and disruption mission in the north Helmand province. Corporal Smith has been described as a soldier who exemplified what it took to be a Special Forces Combat Engineer. Commander of Australian Forces in the Middle East, Major General Michael Crane described Corporal Smith as:</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Small">… a fine soldier and a good bloke, a wonderful Australian who devoted himself to the service of our country.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">Major General Crane knows a good soldier when he sees one. He was the commandant at Kapooka, Wagga Wagga, where all the Australian Army's recruits undertake their initial training, from January 2000 to January 2002. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Corporal Smith had been in the Army for six years and was on his second deployment to Afghanistan after transferring from the Darwin based Number 1 Combat Engineer Regiment to the IRR in 2008. He had been deployed to the Solomon Islands in 2006. Corporal Smith was the 39th Australian soldier to fall in Afghanistan, the seventh this year and, as we heard from the veteran's affairs minister, the 19th Special Forces member, the sixth elite soldier and the 15th digger overall to be killed by an improvised explosive device. As the veterans' affairs minister said, IEDs are indiscriminate weapons of war. They are intended to maim and kill and do destructive damage absolutely indiscriminately. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">At the time of his death, Corporal Smith was engaged in a mission against an insurgent network specialising in IED attacks in the north Helmand province. Defence said more than 100 IEDs in other places were destroyed in the fatal mission, dealing a blow to the network. Comrades described Corporal Smith as:</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Small">… a genuine, honest and dedicated member who was probably one of the best junior non-commissioned officers that the unit has seen. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The Special Operations Task Group Commanding Officer, who cannot be named for operational reasons, told Corporal Smith's comrades that the 24-year-old South Australian:</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Small">… exemplified what it took to be a special forces combat engineer.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Small">"Scott’s sense of obligation, his sense of loyalty and his sense of purpose made him the epitome of the calling of combat engineer," said Lieutenant Colonel I.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Small">"The type of physical and moral courage required of our special forces combat engineers is what we all hope for ourselves, but in the case of this man he displayed it every time he deployed on missions and tasks."</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The officer also made a solemn vow to Corporal Smith's family and partner that he would not be forgotten. He said, 'It is our task to tell others of the type of man that Scott was and the wonderful things he did.' The motto at Corporal Smith's old school, Nuriootpa High in South Australia's Barossa Valley, is per aspera ad astra—through adversity to the stars.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">To underline his courage, skill and service Corporal Smith had been awarded the following honours and awards: Australian Active Service Medal with Clasp International Coalition Against Terrorism, Afghan Campaign Medal, Australian Service Medal with Clasp Solomons, Australian Service Medal with Clasp Counter Terrorism Special Recovery, Australian Defence Medal, NATO International Stabilisation Assistance Force Medal with Multi-Tour Indicator 2, Army Soldiers Medallion, Army Combat Badge and Return From Active Service Badge. During Corporal Smith's service in the Australian Army he was deployed on the following operations: Operation ANODE in the Solomon Islands from November 2006 to December 2006; Operation SLIPPER in Afghanistan from February 2010 to July 2010; Operation NORWICH in Australia from November 2011; and Operation SLIPPER, again, in Afghanistan from July 2012 until his untimely demise.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">His passing is a grim reminder of the sacrifices our military personnel make on our behalf in the war for freedom. Our soldiers are directly protecting our freedom to move unencumbered by the threat of terrorist activity, as well as establishing new peaceful communities in strife torn Afghanistan. As we heard the member for Greenway say, they have made such an inroad, particularly on behalf of women and on behalf of educational opportunities for those people in Afghanistan. Even though their hard work is of great importance, the price Corporal Smith has paid is a heavy one for his family, friends and, indeed, for our nation to bear.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Corporal Smith is survived by his partner, Liv, his parents Katrina Paterson and Murray Smith, and his sister Roxanne. We are forever indebted to him for his sense of duty, his bravery and his sacrifice. He has, as his alma mater's motto suggests, passed the test of adversity and now belongs to the heavens. May he rest in peace. Lest we forget.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Ryan</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">17:52</span>):  I rise to offer my respects to Corporal Scott James Smith, who has paid the ultimate price fighting for Australia, fighting for all Australians. Corporal Smith died while on operations in Afghanistan on 21 October 2012 in northern Helmand province. Despite his comparatively young age, he was on his second deployment to Afghanistan, having served as part of Operation SLIPPER from February 2010 to July 2010 and again from July 2012. Corporal Smith was a member of the Special Operations Task Group and was from the Special Operations Engineer Regiment based at Holsworthy Barracks in Sydney.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Corporal Smith was born in the Barossa Valley in 1988. He joined the Army in February 2006 and upon completion of his initial employment training was posted to the First Combat Engineer Regiment in Darwin. In 2008, Corporal Smith was posted to the then Incident Response Regiment as a search operator. Corporal Smith is described as an exceptional soldier, who possessed all the qualities and charisma of a great junior leader. He is described by his unit as a genuine, honest and dedicated member, who was probably one of the best junior non-commissioned officers that the unit has seen. Corporal Smith sadly, like so many sappers, paid a heavy price for his work in Afghanistan. Our sappers are on the front line. They find and dismantle improvised explosive devices and in doing so, they protect the special forces soldiers who follow them and walk in their footsteps.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">They are brave men, men of extreme courage, who often deal with sophisticated explosives at night, under fire and in a hurry. Corporal Smith was killed in a battle that destroyed an insurgent network specialising in IED attacks. The Special Operations Task Group subsequently removed 100 IEDs from the battlefield. Australians and Afghanis are safer because of Corporal Smith's courage and bravery. On behalf of the Ryan electorate, I extend my sincere condolences to Corporal Smith's family, friends and colleagues. Lest we forget.</span>

                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Mr PERRETT</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Moreton</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">17:54</span>):  I commend the previous speakers on their contributions to this condolence motion for Corporal Scott James Smith. Many speakers have had a particular connection, either through the training bases or by having a large military presence in their electorate. I would like to make a contribution as well, not having known Corporal Scott James Smith but knowing that hopefully, in some way, these eternal words by the representatives of the people of Australia will also recognise the eternal sacrifice by someone way too young to make the ultimate sacrifice—not that there is any age that would be appropriate for the 38 soldiers who had already died in Afghanistan and now for the 39th. All too often I have been on my feet in this chamber recognising the passing of a great Australian in this sacrifice in Afghanistan.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">As a corporal with the special forces combat engineers, given the way soldiers talk, Corporal Smith would have known how closely and how often he and his comrades would have been in harm's way. I am sure he would not have known that growing up in the Barossa Valley. We have heard from other speakers about his passion for waterskiing. As someone who grew up in rural Australia, I know how much waterskiing is such a great joy and I think of him now doing that—and I am sure his family will—and the laughter and the jokes from his time as a bit of a scallywag, from what we have heard from previous speakers, the media coverage and the reports from his family. I think of him laughing and having a great time waterskiing and joking with his friends and his family, and particularly with his partner, Liv. I am sure they are the memories that will be of great comfort to his family in the years ahead. As I said, this is one small contribution in terms of having my words, and the thoughts of the people who reside in the electorate of Moreton, recognise his sacrifice.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I do not have a significant connection with the Army; I am more connected with the RAAF. As with many of the people in the parliament, my other interaction with the military is through the parliamentary placement program, where we get to see the incredible professionalism of our ADF personnel for a week, normally in Australia or around the place. It was from that that I was tempted to see what contribution I could make to the military, and I joined the RAAF Reserve as a legal officer. The other day, as part of a training day, rather than going to Amberley where we normally go—it is nice and safe for RAAF personnel—we went to Enoggera, an Army base, and it was one of the hottest days already this summer. It was in the mid-to high 30s at this training base, for a room full of lawyers. When we broke for lunch, it gave me an insight into the character of our special forces and combat engineers when I saw soldiers running around, on a Saturday, in the middle of the day. You could not get more genteel than RAAF lawyers, specialist reserve people, and here we were seeing the hardcore soldiering at Enoggera. Then, if you take another step higher to someone like Corporal Smith, in terms of the special forces combat engineers, to be back in Afghanistan on his second tour, at such a young age, just puts me in awe of the honours that he has been deservedly awarded.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The family of Corporal Scott James Smith will read these words, hopefully, in the years to come and take some consolation from the incredible awe and respect that this Parliament of Australia, on behalf of all Australians, has for the sacrifice that they have had to endure. I know that none of this will make it particularly easy for them, but I hope that in the years to come they will recognise how appreciative we are of the great professionalism of our soldiers.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We heard from the member for Greenway about the great changes that have occurred in Afghanistan, a particularly troubled nation. Before this condolence motion, we were acknowledging the 10th anniversary of the Bali bombing. Sadly, the two are horribly linked, because we know that we have to take the initiative in this modern world where terrorism is easily exported. That, sadly, means putting Australians in harm's way. We have to take the initiative in places like Afghanistan. We have to engage in our region, in places like those parts of Pakistan where terrorism is rife. Nearly 40,000 people have been killed there—6,000 or 7,000 of those in the military and police. We have to be constantly on the alert and that means we have to make that horrible decision to send Australians overseas. On behalf of all Australians, I thank the family of Corporal Scott James Smith for allowing him to go over there and I acknowledge his great sacrifice. Lest we forget.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Cowan</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">18:01</span>):  With the same sadness that other members have expressed, I consider it an honour to be able to stand in this place to pass on my condolences to the family of Corporal Scott James Smith. As we have heard, Scott James Smith was doing important work—important work for the people of Afghanistan and important work for his colleagues in the Australian Army. He was doing things that needed to be done. As we know, sometimes, in order to get important things done and to protect freedoms and liberties—and to make Afghanistan a better place—somebody has to step up and somebody has to put their life on the line. On this occasion, the person who put his life on the line for a good cause was Corporal Scott James Smith. We thank him for that and I also thank his partner, Liv; his parents, Katrina Paterson and Murray Smith; and his sister, Roxanne. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">There have been 39 Australian deaths in Afghanistan and just yesterday we spoke about Sapper Penpraze and his tragic death at the Holsworthy range. We acknowledge that, with service in the military, the reality is that one's life will always be on the line, whether in training or in operations. Corporal Smith was a combat engineer within the Special Operations Task Group. The task of clearing and searching compounds for improvised explosive devices falls to such soldiers. Corporal Smith was just 24 years old but already a veteran, given his many years of service to our nation. He was an exceptional soldier with the highest qualities and he possessed charisma—clearly he was a very good junior NCO and a young man who no doubt had great potential to rise through the ranks. Corporal Smith was clearly respected by his unit and by his colleagues and he was loved by his family</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">This is a reminder to us all that the decisions we make in this place to send our soldiers, sailors and airmen around the world can sometimes have the gravest of consequences. It is encouraging, though, that we have, overwhelmingly, seen great signs of progress in Afghanistan. The country is a better place for the presence of our soldiers and for the sacrifices they have made. We have more work to do in the next couple of years and we hope that there will be no more deaths from within our forces, but we must nevertheless face the reality that there may be. That happens when we put our people in harm's way. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I thank his family for the sacrifice he made and offer my sympathy for the gap in their lives that they will no doubt feel for years to come.</span>
              </p>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">I express my condolences and my gratitude on behalf of the people of Cowan for the sacrifice that this brave young soldier made and wish his family all the best in the very difficult times ahead.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Kooyong</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">18:05</span>):  I rise to join a chorus of colleagues in paying our deep respects following the death of Corporal Scott James Smith who tragically died in Afghanistan on 21 October 2012. Corporal Smith was only 24 years of age. He was a member of the Special Operations Engineer Regiment based at Holsworthy and he was involved in clearing an area where he was subsequently killed by an improvised explosive device, an IED. He is, tragically, the 39th Australian soldier to die in Afghanistan—more than 240 have been wounded—and he is the 19th fatality from the Special Operations Task Group.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Corporal Smith was a leader among brave men and women. Despite his youthful age he had been in the Army for nearly seven years and during that time he had previously served in Afghanistan as well as in the Solomon Islands. He had received medals of commendation for his service—the Australian Active Service Medal with clasp International Coalition Against Terrorism; the Afghan Campaign Medal; the Australian Service Medal with Clasp Solomon Islands; the Australian Service Medal with Clasp—Counter Terrorism/Special Recovery; the Australian Defence Medal; the NATO International Stabilisation Assistance Force Medal with Multi-Tour Indicator 2; the Army Soldiers Medallion; the Army Combat Badge; and the Returned from Active Service Badge. These were for his participation in Operation ANODE in the Solomon Islands, Operation SLIPPER in Afghanistan, Operation NORWICH in Australia and Operation SLIPPER again in Afghanistan. He was clearly a man who was very accomplished and who served his country well.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Special Operations Commander Australia, Major-General 'Gus' Gilmore spoke of Corporal Smith’s lasting legacy. He said:</span>

                <span class="HPS-Small">Scott was universally respected by everyone in the Special Operations Engineer Regiment, and well liked by all who crossed paths with this fine young man … His fellow combat engineers will honour his sacrifice through continuing the tough and dangerous work they undertake in Afghanistan, with courage and distinction.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">I have been to Afghanistan where I travelled with colleagues from both sides of this House. We saw firsthand the bravery and the professionalism of more than 1,500 Australian men and women who were acting in Afghanistan to make Australia a safer place.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Our contribution in Afghanistan is part of the war on terrorism. Let us not forget that more than 100 Australians have been killed in terrorist attacks abroad, be it in Bali, be in in 9-11, or other bombings throughout the world. Australians have not been immune from the pain and suffering of victims of terrorism. But by being in Afghanistan as part of a multinational force with more than 40 countries we are doing our part to make the world a safer place. What is more, we are giving opportunity to men, to women and to children who would never have known freedom, or safety, or security as they do today.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">There are problems still in Afghanistan—nobody seeks to diminish the size of the task ahead. But with a 300,000-strong Afghan National Police and Afghan National Army, with a girls school that Australian taxpayers have helped fund that we went to visit as it was being built and with other aid programs that we are doing on the ground, we are making a difference in Afghanistan and Corporal Scott James Smith did not give his life in vain.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">It is important to understand that Corporal Smith was not just a fine soldier—he was a fine young man, a partner to Liv, a son to Katrina and Murray, and a sister to Roxanne. In a statement from the family of Corporal Scott James Smith, they say:</span>

When we in this House all go back to our offices and to our families at home, Liv and Katrina and Murray and Roxanne will not have their loved one with them. My heart and my prayers go out to the Smith family. I say to you that your son was braver than us here—he volunteered; he was not conscripted. He volunteered to serve in the Australian Army. He put his life at risk not for one day, not for two days but for weeks, months and in fact years as he served his country. In this place we must always seek to uphold the values that make Australia great, because what Corporal Scott James Smith has done is go abroad and make the ultimate sacrifice to see Afghanistan become a better place and also see Australia be a safer place too. </span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Canberra</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">18:13</span>):  I take this opportunity to commend the member for Kooyong for his moving speech and to echo the sentiments in it. It is with great sadness that I rise to support the condolence motion for Corporal Scott Smith. On the evening of 21 October 2012, Corporal Scott Smith was involved in an operation against a network of insurgents in Uruzgan province in central Afghanistan. While he was searching a compound as part of a team of Afghan and Australian special forces, an improvised explosive devise detonated, taking his life.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Corporal Scott Smith joined the Australian Defence Force in 2006 and within just two years had joined the elite—and they are elite—Special Operations Engineering Regiment. In 2006 he served in the Solomon Islands as part of Operation Anode and in 2010 he completed his first tour of duty in Afghanistan. Corporal Scott Smith was widely respected in his unit, and we have heard from many in the past few days about his wonderful warmth of personality and sense of humour. He received nine honours during his six years of service—an extraordinary achievement for such a young man. He has been described as one of the best junior non-commissioned officers his unit had known and also as an honest, genuine and dedicated man.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Corporal Scott Smith had the honour of helping to protect the President of the United States, Barack Obama, when the president was in Darwin last year. He was selected as part of Operation Norwich, which was the ADF's contribution to the operation put together to protect President Obama when he was here in November.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Tragically, Corporal Scott Smith died just a few weeks before he was due to complete his second tour of duty in Afghanistan. He is the 39th digger to lose his life in Afghanistan and the third combat engineer.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We have over 1,500 ADF members and civilians serving in Afghanistan, and their safety is our uppermost concern. Tonight we have heard from many members of both my party and those opposite about Corporal Scott Smith's achievements, his awards and honours, and we pay tribute to what was an exemplary and promising career. We have heard about our losses to date and our current commitment to bringing peace and security to the Afghani people.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">These numbers have significance in and of themselves, as each loss is keenly felt by the families and friends of those who have died and by all Australians. That is very, very true—it is felt deeply by all Australians. Our concern for those men and women currently serving is ever present. But there is more than a matter of numbers or an individual sprint record to reflect on. Corporal Scott Smith was the loving partner of Liv, the much loved son of Katrina and Murray and the brother of Roxanne. He was a mate and he was a young man dedicated to his mission. By all accounts he exemplified the attributes that make is also proud of the men and women who join our defence forces.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I read that Corporal Scott Smith's family said that the Army was his second family, and this is the case for so many Australian service men and women—it truly is a second family for them. It is important that the public at large understand the dedication and commitment of our young men and women and of the service they give to this country. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Our mission in Afghanistan is critical. We are helping young girls to break free of totalitarianism and oppression. For the first time they are able to get an education. Early this month the world was shocked when Malala, a 15-year-old Pakistani girl, was shot for speaking out against the Taliban and their oppression of women—in particular, women are trying to get an education. If we ever need reminding of why we are trying to suppress the reach of the Taliban and al-Qaeda, the attempt to kill young Malala is why. Our mission there is to restore peace and, hopefully, a level of prosperity to a people who have been victims of extreme oppression, extreme hardship, war and difficulty for many, many decades. Australia's role in world events and particularly in peacekeeping is recognised as critical, and our success in gaining a seat at the United Nations Security Council means we now have a more active voice in shaping security challenges such as Afghanistan.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">As we contemplate this loss, our thoughts are on the tragic death of the brave young Australian. We salute his bravery and we mourn his loss. He will be remembered. On the evening of Sunday, 21 October 2012 a man braved incredible danger in the service of Australia, in the service of the world community and he died tragically. I join with my colleagues in paying tribute to Corporal Scott Smith and sending my condolences, my thoughts and my prayers and my deepest sympathies, and those of the people of Canberra, to his family, friends and mates. Lest we forget.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Hughes</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">18:19</span>):  It is with much sadness that I rise, for the second time in two days, to express my condolences over the loss of a sapper stationed at Holsworthy. The role of a sapper is a brave one. The sapper advances even beyond commandos on the frontline, to provide for their safe passage, locating and dismantling improvised explosive devices, mines and bombs, and does this under fire, often at night. It takes a very special soldier to perform this role, and sadly we have lost too many in recent times.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Corporal Scott Smith was a sapper serving with the Special Operations Task Group and was from the Special Operations Engineer Regiment. It says much of his character that Sapper Smith lost his life while conducting a partnered clearance operation against an insurgent network in Uruzgan. In other words, he was doing his bit to improve conditions and increase the safety of his fellow soldiers. Following this operation, more than 100 IEDs were dismantled and removed from the battlefield. We have seen the devastation that just a single IED can cause. His fellow soldiers are safer because of the work he did in Afghanistan. It is impossible to know how many soldiers are safe tonight because of his courage, his bravery, his skill and his professionalism, but we know it is many.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Sapper Smith was an experienced soldier, with significant frontline operational service and was on his second deployment to Afghanistan, having also served with Operation Anode in the Solomon Islands. Sapper Smith enlisted in the Army in 2006. He demonstrated a strong aptitude and made his way into the ranks of the elite 1st Combat Engineer Regiment after initial employment training. Scott's family said of his aptitude for military life:</span>

              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Small">We knew the Army was Scott's second family, his home away from home. Scott truly believed his actions made a difference; he was a truly dedicated soldier ...</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">But he was much more than that. Scott was someone who loved life and someone who lived life to its fullest. Corporal Smith is survived by his partner, Liv, his parents, Katrina Paterson and Murray Smith, and sister, Roxanne. At this time I think we should pause to think of the absolute evil that Corporal Smith was fighting against. In the history of mankind we have seen many evil ideologies but we have seen very few as evil as the Taliban. In the last week we have had a reminder when the Taliban shot in the head a 14-year-old schoolgirl, Malala, simply because she was speaking about the right for girls to have education. This is the evil that Corporal Smith was fighting against. This is that he gave his life to fight. Lest we forget.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Riverina</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">18:24</span>):  The United Nations Security Council, the UNSC, is the powerful body of the United Nations with the power to authorise the deployment of troops from UN member countries, mandate ceasefires during conflicts and impose economic penalties on countries. The Security Council is comprised of representatives from 15 member countries. However, only five representatives are permanent. The permanent members are the countries of the United States of America, United Kingdom, China, Russia and France.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">It is therefore appropriate that the coalition welcome the vote which took place on 18 October, New York time, which saw Australia secure a two-year term during 2013-14 as a temporary member of the UN Security Council. Australia won its seat with 140 votes in a three-round contest against Finland and Luxembourg, with at least 129 votes required to secure the seat. Australia has held a position on the UN Security Council four times. We first held a seat when the UN was created post World War II, with a seat in 1946-47; again, in 1956-57; followed by 1973-74; and, most recently, in 1985-86.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I share the sentiment of the Leader of the Opposition who said, 'Australia's voice should be heard because of our values, and we should always act in accordance with our values.' The executive director and director of the global issues program at the Lowy Institute, Michael Fullilove, stated that, 'With a seat at the G20 and now on the United Nations Security Council, Australia sits at the two biggest global tables, which will allow us to increase our international leverage and reputation and be a source of prestige. However, it will also stretch our foreign policy development.'</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I would like to acknowledge the former Prime Minister, the Hon. Kevin Rudd, who worked hard to put Australia forward for a seat on the UN Security Council and who began the bidding process. Now that Australia has gained a seat on the UNSC, it is important that the government reaffirms and re-embraces Australia's longstanding principles, values and priorities. The Prime Minister has stated that Australia's key priorities on the council will include Afghanistan, Syria, Iran and North Korea and that Australia will also ensure the effectiveness of UNSC sanction regimes, including those targeting individual associations with al-Qaeda.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The government now needs to explain what it plans to achieve from those priorities and detail any commitments that were made to other nations as it campaigned for support to win the seat. If there is a change of government following the 2013 election—hopefully, that will happen; I am sure the member for Hughes will agree with me—the coalition commits to supporting Australia's officials and to ensuring that Australia serves with distinction and integrity for the remainder of our term on the UNSC.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The UNSC oversees 15 peacekeeping operations—and we all know, and we are now joined by the member for Eden-Monaro, who also knows, how great our commitment is to peacekeeping deployments around the world—as well as 13 political and peace-building missions throughout the globe, with 117,000 personnel deployed. This is the largest number of deployed troops, second only to the United States. The Security Council also manages 13 sanction regimes and eight subsidiary bodies, covering topics including weapons of mass destruction, terrorism and armed conflict.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The government paid almost $25 million to secure the seat on the United Nations Security Council, but the true cost is actually much higher. It is likely that indirect costs will run into the tens of millions of dollars but, to date, the government has, unfortunately, refused to release details of the full cost of the bid. Only this afternoon, we heard that the foreign minister is pushing for $34 million to fund our Security Council seat.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The member for Kooyong has just joined us, and I know that he contributed a very well-written op-ed in the <span style="font-style:italic;">Herald Sun</span> on 15 October in which, admittedly, he did state that getting elected on the Security Council 'will be a good thing'. He wrote:</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Small">Australia is a significant player in the world and, as a founding member of the UN and the 12th biggest contributor to its annual budget, we should always strive to sit at the top table.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Small">But whatever the result on Thursday, the Government has some explaining to do.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The member for Kooyong is right in that respect. He wrote further:</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Small">But perhaps one of most alarming aspects of our UN campaign has been the way our multi-billion-dollar aid budget has been redirected to get us over the line.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Small">Africa, Latin America and the Caribbean have all been the beneficiaries, as a growing share of our $5 billion annual aid budget has been dispensed to those regions.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">He wrote that, as the shadow foreign affairs minister had pointed out:</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Small">… this has included funding some very odd projects—</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">As the member for Kooyong termed it—</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Small">including $150,000 for a statue commemorating the anti-slavery movement in Africa and the Caribbean to be located at the UN Plaza in New York.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">…   …   …</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Small">On Australia's doorstep in the South Pacific there is real humanitarian need. For example, 12,000 children under five die in Papua New Guinea each year and a significant number of households in the Solomon Islands do not have access to quality sanitation.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Small">This is where our aid priority should be. Yes, we have global responsibilities, but first and foremost we should look to improve the situation in our own backyard.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I know that the amount of money we are talking about—$25 million to secure the seat and $34 million now to go towards our position on the UNSC—could work wonders; it could support all sorts of projects—hospitals, water infrastructure or whatever—in regional areas. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">However, I take this opportunity to say, 'Well done on securing the seat.' It is important to be at the top table, as the member for Kooyong acknowledged and, indeed, as the Leader of the Opposition acknowledged. We as a coalition supported the government in its bid to get the seat. We have now obtained the seat and we need to make the most of it. I also take this opportunity to congratulate the other nations who also won a temporary UNSC seat—South Korea, Luxembourg, Argentina, and Rwanda.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">
                  <a href="HRI" type="MemberSpeech">
                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Dr MIKE KELLY</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Eden-Monaro</span>—<span class="HPS-MinisterialTitles">Parliamentary Secretary for Defence</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">18:30</span>):  This is a moment of great celebration for this nation. After having missed out on a seat on the Security Council for so many years, to have now secured this position is a massive tribute to the many people who worked so hard on our bid—former Prime Minister Kevin Rudd, who also worked assiduously on this bid while foreign minister; the current Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade, Senator Carr; Gary Quinlan and all the team at the UN mission; so many of our post staff all around the world; and the many members of caucus and the government who used every opportunity at every level of engagement to advance the cause. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">This achievement also has great personal meaning for me. My initial history with this goes back to the Howard government's bid for a seat on the Security Council back in 1996, in which I was heavily involved. With the 1996 bid, we were of the view that the bid was going to be successful—we had been given certain indications from the post in New York to that effect. We had scheduled a meeting over at DFAT for the day after the vote to talk about what we were going to do with this seat on the Security Council. But that meeting became a wake instead of a celebration and a plan for the way ahead. I will never forget sitting in the cafeteria, commiserating with my DFAT colleagues, when the foreign minister of the time, Alexander Downer, came up to one of my DFAT colleagues—I won't name him—slapped him on the back and said, 'Never mind, mate—who cares anyway?' Those were his exact words. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">From that point on, the Howard government's attitude to the Security Council and to the United Nations was completely poisoned. After that time, we were shackled to the Deputy Dawg syndrome—not that there is anything wrong with making sure that our relationship with our No.1 security partner, the United States, is sound and secure. But, from that point on, the Howard government completely turned its back on multilateralism and on recognising what the UN brings to the table in relation to achieving security outcomes. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">This was a dark period. Those of us who were operating at a working level did our best to maintain Australia's relationship, engagement and reputation with various colleagues in UN agencies and UN related supported organisations. I am very proud of my involvement with the challenges of the peacekeeping movement established by the Swedes—arising out of the Folke Bernadotte Academy and, in particular, the efforts of Annika Hilding Norberg, who did such a great job in getting that organisation rolling. The academy featured many of the key players in UN peacekeeping and supporters of the UN organisation. Through those years, we were able to keep Australia's flag flying in the various secretariats and in the organisation itself—so that they understood that the attitudes of the government were not necessarily those of a country with a rich tradition of engagement with the United Nations, as is well known and understood. The involvement of Doc Evatt, Ben Chifley and others in shaping the institutions of the UN and many of its early instruments, such as the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, is a proud part of Australian Labor's history.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">So it is a proud history and we are now picking up the torch again to carry forward. The last time that we had a Security Council seat was of course under the Hawke-Keating government.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The fact that the Howard government never made a subsequent bid and did not understand what the UN was useful for in a security context was well illustrated a number of times through the period of the Howard government. One of these was the involvement in Iraq. During that time it was not appreciated that the instruments of the United Nations are extremely useful in things like political transition, in delivering legitimacy through the operation and management and institution of electoral processes. It was very frustrating for me, being in Iraq, to see the time wasted with the attitude that was evidenced against United Nations' instruments and United Nations' officials on the ground under that great man Sergio Vieira de Mello, who was a good friend of mine, as were many of the staff at the Canal Hotel, the UN headquarters, with whom I had worked—people such as Fiona Watson and Nadia Younes. They were all great people, who would have been very useful in moving the ball forward in Iraq after the terrible problems and setbacks we suffered as a result of the lack of legitimacy in that operation because UN processes were not properly adhered to and worked through and because the war itself was based on a false premise—in fact, on a lie.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">A lot of time was wasted on the ground in Iraq and the great tragedy that followed was the bombing of the Canal Hotel. We lost all those great friends with whom we had worked up until that point, including Nadia, Fiona and Sergio.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">That was one example of the Howard government not adding its voice to advocating for a greater involvement of the UN. Eventually, the US administration at the time, the Bush administration, realised that you had to turn to the UN to effect a transition that would be acceptable to the Iraqis.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Another example was during the second East Timor crisis, in 2006, when the view, held strongly within Defence, was that we should have again turned to a blue-helmeted operation there. That would have not only defrayed costs of the operation but also helped us to accumulate and assemble a more varied and more representative group of participating nations. But, again, the foreign minister at the time, Mr Downer, rejected the advice seeking to place that operation under a UN umbrella.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We have seen Mr Abbott, the Leader of the Opposition, continue with this lack of understanding, this supreme ignorance of multilateralism and its importance to our neighbours in this region. Nothing could be more illustrative of that than Mr Abbott's incredible comments when he condemned the Prime Minister for 'swanning around' at the UN in support of our bid and, as he said, 'talking to Africans, when she should have been meeting the Indonesian President'. He did not understand it because, of course, the Indonesian President was there. Mr Abbott does not understand how important the UN is to the Indonesians, the Malaysians, the Chinese, the Koreans—to all our neighbours, all of those who are concerned about having a mechanism that helps to ameliorate the great power dynamics in this world, that helps get the agendas of small and medium countries dealt with and the protections and rules that govern the international space that give them confidence. There was a total lack of understanding on behalf of the coalition about the importance of the UN to our neighbours. How could he then accuse the Prime Minister of not doing her job when, in fact, she was in New York in support of our bid, talking to Africans and the Indonesian Prime Minister. Of course, not only is there a lack of understanding that the UN is important to our neighbours but also the importance of the growth of Africa and our relationship with Africa is really strongly evident here as well.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I remember well in 1996 our bid failed largely because of the lack of support of Africa and the lack of our engagement with Africa. That was also not understood by the Howard government. One of the great benefits of this process has been the successful re-engagement of Australia with Africa. When people talk about the $25 million that was spent on this bid, they do not appreciate that this is not $25 million that was spent on a bid; this was $25 million that was invested in our broader diplomatic engagement, which was going to produce a payoff regardless of whether we had on this bid or not. It is not well understood by the coalition that there are 300 Australian companies or more operating in Africa these days. Africa is coming continent and it is just as important to us in the longer term as our relationship with our near neighbours in the Asia-Pacific region. Asia-Pacific is certainly more advanced down that trail, as the Asian white paper well and truly illustrates and elucidates, but Africa will not be far behind. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">So it was important for us to re-engage. As someone who has served in Africa wearing a blue beret—someone who has been very, very concerned and seriously interested in re-engaging with Africa—it was a great delight to me to see this happen. It paid off big time. It is hard for us to work out in fact any country in Africa that did not support our bid. That was a great outcome of the investment and the process.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Mr Abbott's comments not only displayed his ignorance but also his disloyalty. The sorts of comments we saw coming from shadow foreign minister and Deputy Leader of the Opposition was like going to a Wallabies match and hearing Australians hectoring their own team. What gross disloyalty this was in the lead-up to the vote and what absolute hypocrisy now for them to say, 'Well, yes, it is a good thing, and of course we supported,' when they did everything to undermine that bid. That was gross disloyalty from people who claim to be good Australians. There was no evidence of it in the lead-up to that bid. There was no assistance from any member of the coalition in that bid. So they cannot claim the slightest kudos for this effort that was mounted exclusively by a Labor government—and overwhelmingly successfully so. As the Foreign Minister claimed, This was big and it was juicy.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">So now what is it we do with success we have achieved? We will do a lot of things that will advance Australia's cause and Australia's interests in this world, which are incredibly interdependent. The globalised world that we live in is globalised not only economically but also in its security concerns. We will advance the benefits of Australians in a more secure and more economically stable world. We have a lot to bring to the table with our experience in peacekeeping and our experience in aid and development. Being on the Security Council will amplify our voice in that space. We will make great use of it, as we have a lot of useful and positive things to say in that space. The benefits that we will obtain over many years from now from the rejuvenation of our engagement in the international community will be evident. Also, of course, it offers us the opportunity to ensure a better environment for the world as a good citizen, as Australians have always sought to do. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">In this context I would like to particularly pay tribute, in addition to, of course, all those who worked so hard and that I have enumerated, I am particular proud of the efforts of the Australian Civil-Military Centre in supporting this effort. They have sailed under the radar a bit, but they worked extremely hard and provided a lot of the substance that convinced people of Australia's benefit of being on the Security Council—what we can actually deliver; the policy outcomes. Many times interlocutors that I engaged with would say to me, 'Australia will win this bid if you can project a positive policy platform for going forward.' The Australian Civil-Military Centre certainly did that. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I was very pleased to be involved in establishing the centre. In fact, it was one of the key reasons why I entered politics in the first place. The establishment of the centre, understood and supported by former Prime Minister Rudd, was a key factor in my green to run for the seat of the Eden-Monaro. I was very pleased to be with the centre when we engaged with the African Union on the protection of civilians concept and advancing that cause, and was with the centre team in Addis Ababa engaging with the secretary and giving flesh to the engagement strategy and the message that we were sending to Africa. It was well appreciated. We have African representatives coming to Australia, and we did a lot of solid work.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I want to pay tribute to Peter Thomson from the Attorney-General's Department who did so much good work in drafting the materials for the protection of civilians policies that the African Union were reaching out for and the substance of how those things were to be implemented in the advice and the assistance that we gave them in that process.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">The centre also engaged very extensively with permanent representatives. In fact, 65 permanent representatives attended many of the seminars that the Civil-Military Centre conducted from 14 June 2011 through to August 2012. I was very pleased to have opened the last of those seminars in August. Lessons learned activities were performed by the centre, including the production of the <span style="font-style:italic;">Partnering for Peace: Australia’s Peacekeeping and Peacebuilding Experiences in the Autonomous Region of Bougainville in Papua New Guinea, and in Solomon Islands and Timor-Leste</span><span style="font-style:italic;">. </span>It is a fantastic product. I was very pleased to have been in New York for a few days with Jose Ramos-Horta. We conducted a number of activities based on the production of this product, conducted lessons learned seminars and talked about Australia's contribution in this space but also what we can bring to the table as a result of that experience and those contributions in the past.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The centre put a lot of hard work into setting up those activities in New York and having many visits from permanent representatives in Australia associated with activities that they were running. That included the International Forum for the Challenges of Peace Operations that I mentioned I had been previously engaged with. They are our instrument in engagement with the challenges process at this time and are doing a lot of hard work and a lot of good work in that space as well.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I want to pay tribute to Dr Alan Ryan; his predecessor, Mike Smith, a good friend of mine and former Army general who got the centre up and running in the first place and who is well-known to our East Timorese friends; and my friend the member for Page, who had extensive experience in Timor Leste herself and whose contacts were also very useful in advancing our cause and acceptance within the Asia-Pacific as a representative of this region, notwithstanding that we are in WEOG. It was most pleasing to see in my engagement with interlocutors in this process that they did generally saw Australia as now a member of the Asia-Pacific community and one of their voices and not as an alien European voice, as we were in the past, particularly during the 'Deputy Dawg' Howard years.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The centre has also conducted many courses and continues to help build relationships in the region with other organisations and institutions that are in the same civil-military space. I congratulate the team on all their hard work. I look forward now to what this Labor government, understanding as it does multilateral security and understanding as it does the cultural, security and economic interests of our region and of the world more generally, will do with the opportunity that this seat now affords us. It is something that at the end of which all of Australia will and can be proud of. I am hopeful that people like the member for Kooyong, who perhaps understands foreign affairs a little better than Mr Abbott—and he famously acknowledged he does not—and the shadow minister, will contribute to growing the understanding within the coalition of the importance of this seat and what it can be used for in achieving a better outcome for the world, for Australia's interests and for our region.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Brisbane</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">18:48</span>):  On 19 October this year Australia secured what has been and is rightly described as a once in a generation opportunity of filling a temporary seat on the United Nations Security Council. The coalition welcomes this outcome and pays tribute to the hard work of many diplomatic officials and staff in the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade in making this opportunity a reality. Proper respect and acknowledgement should also be paid to the former Prime Minister, the member for Griffith, Kevin Rudd, for setting this aspirational goal. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The challenge now is to make the most of this very rare opportunity. You would think that the uniqueness of this opportunity would mean that the government had a well-developed plan and a strategy for making the most of it. Regrettably, briefing notes obtained under the Freedom of Information Act and prepared by DFAT for the incoming foreign affairs minister Bob Carr reveal that this was not the case. Senator Bob Carr became Australia's Minister for Foreign Affairs on 13 March. The briefing notes for him as the incoming Minister for Foreign Affairs do include a specific reference to the United Nations Security Council campaign.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I note on page 18 of these briefing notes that DFAT refers to the 'commencement of the development of a strategy, including objectives, priorities and resourcing'. That is right, 'the commencement of the development of a strategy'. You would be forgiven for wondering why wasn't there a strategy in place in the first place? Also, on page 19 of the same briefing notes, a reference is made to commencing the development of a strategy for how Australia would use its membership and how we would resource membership. I seek to table the incoming minister's briefing notes.</span>

                  </a>  That is a shame; the truth is in those briefing notes. These were obtained under freedom of information and they show that there was no strategy, there was no clear policy direction on how to make use of the United Nation Security Council bid. It is a shame that the member for Page will not allow me to table these notes.</span>

                    <span class="HPS-MemberContinuation">Ms GAMBARO:</span>
                  </a>  It is hypocrisy. Nevertheless, these statements will support the view that the whole UN Security Council campaign was not planned—it was not strategic in its development, it was done at the last minute, it was done on the hop, it was done on the run—and that is no way to run such an important strategy. We heard from the member for Eden-Monaro what a fantastic opportunity it was to take a seat at this very important council, but that is no way to run a strategy. This may well be due to the fact that it was largely predicated on buying votes. This was demonstrated very clearly to us all by the skewing of the foreign aid budget—I will speak more on that issue shortly—but what is really concerning about the information revealed in the briefing note is that even at this late stage, and at the time of the briefing of Mr Carr as the incoming foreign minister, DFAT still did not know what the government's strategy was for how it would use its membership. Not so great planning on how we could use this once-in-a-generation opportunity.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">It is also clear from the briefing notes that the Australian taxpayer would be up for more money in footing the bill to resource our United Nations Security Council membership. In terms of what a fist Australia will make of this once-in-a-generation opportunity, rather than hit the ground running, Labor's ineptitude and failure to develop a plan or strategy means that we are in danger of just hitting the ground. Much has been said about the secret costs of the bid beyond the $25 million that the government very loosely admits to. What is very clear is that an analysis of the budget ministerial statements and the portfolio budget statements going back to 2007-08 shows that there has been an incredible level of changed expenditure on foreign aid since this time. In fact we are looking at $2.9 billion, and all since the United Nations Security Council bid was announced.</span>

                  </a>  A critical question—I thank the member for Kooyong—that Australian taxpayers really need to ask is: how is Australia's foreign aid objectives and our foreign aid priorities being advanced by some of these notable recent expenditures? I just want to take you through some of these expenditures: $150,000 for a statue to commemorate antislavery in the Caribbean and Africa to be built in the UN Plaza in New York.</span>

                  </a>  The member for Kooyong has every right to be outraged. In terms of priority, what is AusAID doing to ensure the foreign aid money is being spent at the coalface, on the people who need it the very most?</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">I would like someone to explain to me how this statue will assist people in need in Africa and in the Caribbean. Let us have a look at another one: $270,000 for reviewing agriculture and fisheries management in Eritrea between 2008 and 2010. I wonder how the Australian seafood industry feel about that one after Minister Burke's recent announcement that he wants to lock away more of Australia's fishing grounds. What tangible benefits have been delivered to the Eritrean fishing industry as a result of this money? Then there was $300,000 in 2009 for membership of the Convention on Biological Diversity in Kenya. This must be one of the most expensive membership fees around. What tangible benefits has this funding allocation delivered? Maybe we will get some clarity from this one: $65 million for a giant telescope project in Chile's Atacama Desert. Other than being a very expensive gadget for ET to phone home, why was this funding allocation a priority for AusAID, and why did AusAID not make a determination that this money could be spent much more productively in our own region—for example, by tackling the TB epidemic in PNG?</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">If this $3 billion aid increase in foreign aid spending in Africa, the Caribbean, South-East Asia and the Pacific supposedly has nothing to do with the UN Security Council bid, what has changed so much about Australia's foreign aid priorities between 2007 and 2008? Why has there been an increase of 251 per cent in how much we are spending in Africa? That has gone up from $101 million to $354.6 million between 2007-08 and now. Equally, other than the apparent need to build a statue in New York, what has changed so much about Australia's foreign aid priorities since 2007-08 that we have increased our foreign aid spend in the Caribbean from zero to almost $48 million in 2012-13?</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">But the most important question is: how much has Australia's future foreign aid focus been skewed by the success of our bid? In recent estimates, under questioning from Senator Kroger, AusAID Director General Peter Baxter admitted that there had been separate buckets of funding across a range of government agencies for the delivery of projects of foreign countries which just happened to coincide with the timing of the UN Security Council bid. Mr Baxter made this admission while at the same time trying to claim that Australia's foreign aid budget had not been impacted by the Security Council bid.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">But what I find really confusing about all of these statements is that this dynamic must cause significant problems for AusAID, with the apparent lack of coordination in the allocation and expenditure of consolidated revenue for the delivery of projects in foreign countries which are in effect foreign aid projects. An obvious matter of concern is that this lack of coordination creates inefficiencies in that AusAID and other government agencies could well be duplicating expenditure or acting at cross-purposes, therefore decreasing the level of Australia's foreign aid effectiveness.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">It seems very clear from the analysis of the budget papers going back to 2007-08 that the level of foreign aid Australia provides in our own region has been hijacked to facilitate the Security Council bid, and it is indeed telling. It is demonstrated by the following facts: the percentage of Australia's foreign aid budget spent in the Pacific, including New Guinea, has decreased by 4.5 per cent between 2007-08 and now, and the percentage of Australia's foreign aid budget spent in East Asia, including Indonesia, has decreased by five per cent between 2007-08 and now. What we have seen since 2007-08 is a 251 per cent increase in Australia's level of aid to Africa, while we have record levels of tuberculosis infection in PNG and a failed $170 million program to combat AIDS and HIV in our nearest neighbour.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">While the coalition welcomes Australia's appointment to the Security Council, it is very clear that we do not have a plan. We have splashed money all around with little or no way of design or strategy. In conclusion, the coalition urges the government to focus on our region and not to squander the opportunity that has been made available.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">
                  <a href="HWQ" type="MemberSpeech">
                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Mr MARLES</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Corio</span>—<span class="HPS-MinisterialTitles">Parliamentary Secretary for Pacific Island Affairs and Parliamentary Secretary for Foreign Affairs</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">19:00</span>):  It is with great pleasure that I speak on the very successful bid by Australia to become a member of the United Nations Security Council. Principally, I thank the many people involved in this campaign and who have run a fabulous campaign on behalf of our nation. I think this is a moment in which it would be good for there to be a sense of national unity on what has been achieved. It is disappointing to hear a tone of political contest about unquestionably a wonderful achievement for this country, one which is consistent with Australian foreign policy as it has been exercised by both sides of politics since the formation of the UN after the Second World War.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">This is the fifth occasion on which we will serve on the UN Security Council. The first was under the Chifley government. The second and third were under the Menzies government in the fifties and sixties. When we served in the 1980s, the campaign was initiated under the Fraser government but came to its fruition under the Hawke government. When we failed to win in 1996, it was a campaign initiated by the Keating government and brought to its conclusion by the Howard government. Alexander Downer in 2001 was keen to pursue the case again, but ultimately did not. In 2008, we launched the campaign which has been successful in 2012. The point of giving that history is to show that we have regularly served on the Security Council. In a sense we have just gone through the longest drought of not serving on the Security Council, but the urge to serve has been the natural instinct of conservative and Labor government alike, because Australia is a country which seeks to be an activist middle power which pulls its weight in the world.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The process of seeking membership of the Security Council and putting Australia's credentials before the world has been incredibly important for Australia's foreign policy beyond these two years. It is a very healthy act for Australia to engage in, just as it is a healthy act for everybody in this chamber to place our credentials before our constituencies every three years. Since the formation of the United Nations, effectively Australia has by and large put its credentials before the world every decade roughly. That did not happen in the seventies or the first decade of this millennium, but roughly speaking we have put our credentials before the world about each decade. That is a very healthy thing to do.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">In this instance, it has helped to sharpen our foreign policy. We have learnt a lot from the process as undoubtedly we would have learnt a lot from campaigning previously, just as all of us learn about our constituencies when we put ourselves before them in the lead-up to an election. One thing we have learnt is the world is a much smaller place than it was when we last sat on the Security Council back in the mid-eighties. Also, there is no room for isolationism today. It is very important, when the opposition seeks to put forward its critique of Australia's participation, that it does not walk down a path of isolationism in the arguments made.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">When I hear arguments that we should focus directly on our region, as if to take an interest in the rest of the world has no relevance to our region, that worries me. When I hear a criticism about Australia participating in the Giant Magellan Telescope in Chile—one of the major advances in astronomy in this decade and one of the most important areas of Australian expertise where Australia has led the world in astrophysics—I get worried. That is about Australia looking inwards and not pursuing its historical mandate under both persuasions of government, where we seek to engage in the world as a middle power doing our best in our own modest way to influence the world, but most importantly to understand the currents of global politics and global trade so that we can best navigate out way through as a middle power for the benefit of our country. We have done that well in terms of our engagement with Asia post-war, again under governments of both persuasions.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I can point to an area—for example, our engagement in Africa—where we have seen our development assistance increase in the context of an increasing aid budget to Africa. Our engagement in Africa now is vastly better than it was before we entered this exercise, and it will set the tone for Australia's engagement in Africa well beyond our participation on the Security Council. Why should we have an increased engagement in Africa? In fact, resource companies of Australia are playing a critical role in the resource development of Africa, which in turn is one of the key reasons that that continent is enjoying an economic emergence. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">It is missing the point for Australia at a government level to not make sure we do everything we can to support our private sector engagement in Africa. The kind of development assistance we are engaging in with Africa supports that, with mining for development initiatives and scholarships—1,000 across the continent, many within the mining industry and within government so that this continent can best utilise the phenomenon it is experiencing in its economic emergence. That is in Australia's national interests. It is a good thing for Australia to do. There are Australian companies and Australian citizens who will benefit by virtue of that better engagement in Africa, and there is no doubt that our campaign for the Security Council and the exercise of placing our credentials before the world has helped enhance our engagement in Africa. There are many other examples: Latin America, Brazil and other parts of the world. This is a good thing. To start criticising it because it is beyond a three-hour shift in our time zone from Sydney is an act of isolationism. It worries me greatly in terms of where the opposition currently position themselves in foreign policy.  </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">This leads to the second point. There are so many lessons to be learned from around the world in relation to our own region. In the Caribbean, we have an aid program—a pretty modest one at $60 million over four years—which is supporting an engagement and a level of cooperation between the Caribbean and the Pacific. It stands to reason that we are likely to learn more about the process of developing countries with small island developing states when we look at and examine the more developed small island states of the Caribbean. Similarly, when we want to see how there can be a social dividend from the resource projects in Papua New Guinea, we do learn a lot from seeing the very successful example of that in Botswana. It stands to reason that examining world's best practice across the globe is the best chance we have of implementing world's best practice at home. That is exactly why our engagement—modest as it is—in the Caribbean actually helps people in the Pacific, because we are learning lessons that can be applied in the Pacific. It is why our engagement in Africa helps Papua New Guinea. This is not rocket science. You need to look at and engage with the world if you are going to draw the best practice world lessons to apply at home and within our region. To say that to go any further than a three-hour shift in our time zone in terms of our engagement is to put a blinker on about what is going on in the world in the context of a globe today, which is much smaller, where information is being shared much more than it ever has been before.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I think it is really important for our friends on the other side of politics to understand that lesson, because this is very much the tradition of conservative politics when they have been in government. Making the isolationist argument that is being made now in the critique about the UN is running completely contrary to the way in which former conservative governments in this country have engaged with the rest of the world. It really does behove the opposition to think carefully about its own traditions in managing our foreign policy when it has had the opportunity to do so. But, unfortunately, right now the mean-spirited critique that we are seeing in relation to Australia's success in getting elected to the United Nations Security Council evidences how ill-prepared the opposition is to lead Australia's foreign policy. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">That said, there is no doubt that the election of Australia to the United Nations Security Council is a wonderful moment for our country and is a wonderful achievement for Australian diplomacy. There are many people who deserve this government's thanks in bringing this about. Can I start by mentioning the two prime ministers who have been in place during the period of this campaign, Kevin Rudd and Julia Gillard. Kevin Rudd, obviously, began the process of seeking a seat on the Security Council and he deserves much credit in terms of what has ultimately been achieved. But there is also no doubt that Julia Gillard brought this home. I was with the Prime Minister in New York during the leaders week a few weeks ago and her performance was utterly critical to seeing Australia ultimately be elected to the Security Council.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We have had three foreign ministers during this time. Stephen Smith began the campaign and was wonderful in the work that he did. Kevin Rudd as foreign minister continued the work that he had done as Prime Minister with an amazing amount of energy and vigour which really set the tempo for all of us in terms of the way in which we went about this campaign. Of course there was Bob Carr who introduced to the world the eloquence and charm that he has shown to the people of New South Wales over the last couple of decades. That charm unquestionably hit its mark at a global level and was very important in terms of seeing the result that we were able to celebrate a couple of weeks ago.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I would like to acknowledge Dennis Richardson, the Secretary of the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade, whose steadfast advice was so important throughout this whole process, and Gillian Bird, currently Acting Secretary, who was the relevant deputy secretary of the department for much of the time and who played such an important role as well. Within the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade in Canberra a task force was established for the UN Security Council campaign, and that was headed by Caroline Millar whose work was tireless in bringing about this result. She has done an amazing job. She has also participated significantly in the very successful campaign for the election of the Director-General, an Australian, of the World Intellectual Property Organization. So, Caroline Miller can now lay claim to being DFAT's prime numbers person. She deserves an enormous amount of credit and this is a great moment of satisfaction.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Can I also mention those others in the UN Security Council task force team—Blanca Amado, Bassim Blazey, Shae-Lee Burnell, Toni Caggiano, Madeline Chmura, Kate Duff, Julia Feeney, Ian Gerard, Laura Kemp, Isabelle Kremer, Michael Kulesza, Lizzie Landels, David Lewis, Rachel Lord, Emily Luck, Craig Maclachlan, Simon Mamouney, Paul Martin, Dieter Michel, Helen Mitchell, Anne Moores, Will Nankervis, Lara Nassau, Christopher Nixon, Therese O'Meally, Gaia Puleston, Hugh Robilliard, Scott Rutar, Arthur Spyrou, Jen Vanderstok and William Underwood. My thanks go to every one of those people.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">In New York the campaign was spearheaded by our ambassador and permanent representative to the United Nations Gary Quinlan. If this is any person's triumph, it is Gary's. There is absolutely no doubt that his efforts in the final few years of this campaign were so vital in getting the result that we did. The extent to which those countries, who had committed their vote to us, ultimately stuck on the day is an enormous tribute to the sense and confidence that ambassadors in the United Nations of other countries had in our Ambassador Gary Quinlan. He deserves our nation's gratitude. He has done an amazing thing.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I would also like to acknowledge Australia's former ambassador and permanent representative to the United Nations Robert Hill, a former minister in the Howard government, who played a very important role as well. Unquestionably his role, both as the permanent representative and the ambassador to UN, and also as a former minister of the Howard government, gave this campaign from the outset a bipartisan flavour and we are very grateful to the work that Robert Hill did.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I would like to acknowledge Philippa King, the deputy head of mission to the United Nations and her predecessor Andrew Goledzinowski, both of whom have done fantastic work. I would like to acknowledge the UN Security Council campaign manager in New York, Anastasia Carayanides, and her team of Chelsey Martin, Peter Stone and Sally Weston, all of whom I worked closely with. They all deserve our thanks.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">They were the key people who pursued the campaign but they were supported by a range of other people in New York—both Australian posted officers and locally engaged staff who either contributed directly to the campaign or supported the general operations of Australia's UN mission in New York and Australia's consulate in New York. Each contributed to the overall success of the campaign. In that context I would again like to acknowledge Will Nankervis but, in addition to Will, Damian White, Caroline Fogarty, Sue Robertson, Jared Potter, Claire Elias, Tanisha Hewanpola, Emil Stojanovski, Ian Robinson, Dean Cottam, Lauren Patmore, Ryan Neelam and all their predecessors, plus all the locally engaged staff who worked for DFAT in New York.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The staff of the Australian consulate in New York have also carried a significant burden in the context of this campaign. I would like to acknowledge our Consul-General in New York, Phil Scanlan, and I would also like to make special mention of Rebecca Smith—Bec took great care of me during my numerous visits to New York, particularly in the week of the vote. I also acknowledge the AusAID team in New York led by Peter Versegi, the Defence team in New York led by Brian Walsh and the AFP staff in New York led by Terrance Nunn and all of their predecessors.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I visited a number of countries around the world in this campaign, and I went to a number of multilateral meetings all of which involved  significant amounts of work. I would like to acknowledge Paul O'Sullivan, our High Commissioner to New Zealand during the 2011 Pacific Island Forum and all his team; our current High Commissioner to New Zealand and the Cook Islands, Michael Potts, who looked after the Pacific Island Forum this year; our then High Commissioner to Sri Lanka but in this context the Maldives, Kathy Klugman, who looked after our presence at the SAARC summit in the Maldives last year; Ambassador Patricia Holmes in Argentina, who is also the Ambassador to Uruguay, who looked after the Mercosur summit in 2011; High Commissioner Philip Kentwell in the Caribbean, who was with me during the COFCOR conference in 2012; Ambassador Lisa Filipetto, who was with me in Ethiopia during the African Union summit; and of course during leaders week this year Gary Quinlan led his team. I acknowledge all of those who provided support to those heads of mission in all of those efforts.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I would also like to acknowledge all the other heads of mission who are currently posted overseas and their teams of locally engaged staff and Australian staff, particularly in those small posts with multiple accreditations who did so much work with all the countries with which they engaged. There is so much work that goes into a campaign of this kind, and there are so many people behind the scenes in each of those posts, but all of their efforts count. They in turn are supported by a range of people at DFAT headquarters in Canberra who have worked on policy and strategy across many countries, as well as those who have worked on incoming and outgoing visits associated with the campaign.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">With regard to my visits overseas, I acknowledge in particular the work of Paul Myler, former head of one of the Europe branches at DFAT and his team; Dave Sharma, head of the Africa Branch and his team; John Richardson and Rowena Thompson, who have overseen work associated with my recent visits to Central America and the Caribbean; Jennifer Rawson, who heads the Pacific Division; and the team in the Executive Branch led by Bryce Hutchesson.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The contribution of other departments has also played a very important role—Defence, AFP, the Department of Climate Change and others. I particularly acknowledge AusAID and Peter Baxter and his entire staff, both in Canberra and overseas. Finally I would like to acknowledge—</span>

                  </a>  This is important, because these people played a very significant role in what is a very significant achievement for our country, and it is a moment we should be celebrating in the right spirit. I would like to acknowledge the special envoys, who did an incredible job in visiting countries around the world: Bob McMullan, who was appointed to a number of anglophone African countries and is a highly experienced and distinguished former minister and member of this place; Joanna Hewitt, a former Secretary of DAFF and DFAT deputy secretary, who looked after a number of other anglophone African countries; Bill Fisher, who was the envoy to the francophone countries and La Francophonie, an organisation including 53 francophone UN member states; Dr Russell Trood, a former Liberal Party senator who did a wonderful job not only in the week itself but in the years leading up to the vote as our special envoy to Eastern Europe, the Balkans and the Caucuses; John McCarthy, the special envoy to Latin America; Neil Mules, who was the special envoy to the lusophone countries; former Deputy Prime Minister Tim Fischer, who was our special envoy to Eritrea, Rwanda, South Sudan and Bhutan and who, again, did a wonderful job in each of those places; and Peter Tesch, who was our special envoy to Central Asia. I would also like to acknowledge Ahmed Fahour, who was our special envoy to the Organisation of Islamic Cooperation.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Each of those people played a very significant role in this win. In acknowledging the very many that I have tonight, I hope it gives some indication of the size of the effort in getting Australia elected to the United Nations Security Council for the fifth time. In many respects, the names that I have been able to put into <span style="font-style:italic;">Hansard</span><span style="font-style:italic;"></span>tonight are just the tip of the iceberg of the incredible effort that was done on behalf of our country. Those people, both those I named and all those who supported this effort, deserve Australia's thanks.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Kooyong</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">19:20</span>):  It is my pleasure to follow the member for Corio in this place to welcome Australia's election as a temporary member of the UN Security Council. The member for Corio is a good man and he did pay tribute to a number of people within the Department of Foreign Affairs and elsewhere who have contributed significantly to this win. He also placed a straw man before this parliament when he talked about the isolationist tendencies of the coalition. That is absolute rubbish. His comments, together with those of the member for Eden-Monaro, who made some outrageous slurs against Australia's longest serving foreign minister, Alexander Downer, and Australia's second longest serving Prime Minister, John Howard, should have been retracted because they overtly politicised this debate and gloss over the significant foreign policy achievements of the Howard government.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">When we talk about multilateralism, how could we forget INTERFET and East Timor? How could we forget what we have done in Bougainville, what we have done at a multilateral level to take on the terrorists and stamp out terrorism in our region and the highest level of cooperation with our most important near neighbour, Indonesia? How could we forget the many FTAs, what we did at the Doha Round on the free trade agenda and the counter-terrorism bilaterals? I could go on. There was a significant foreign policy legacy from the Howard government, and it has been glossed over in the comments from the member for Eden-Monaro and the straw man placed before this House by the member for Corio. This coalition, both in opposition and in government, stands ready to play its part at the multilateral level in a way that is consistent with Australian values and in a manner that furthers the national interest.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We are here to pay tribute to those who contributed to our election as one of the 10 temporary members on the UN Security Council for 2013-14, where we will join the permanent five: United States, Russia, China, France and Great Britain. It was interesting that the member for Corio mentioned the contribution of former Prime Minister, Kevin Rudd. One would have thought he would have voted for him, but he did not. The member for Corio referred to the three foreign ministers, Stephen Smith, Kevin Rudd and Bob Carr, who all contributed to this election campaign. The fact that we have had three foreign ministers in less than five years is a reflection of the disunity and chaos we have seen on the other side. In contrast, the coalition had the same foreign minister for nearly 12 years of government. We have seen three on the other side in less than five years. The member for Corio referred to the charm of Bob Carr. I thought he was going to bring out a bouquet of flowers. That charm did not do much for the infrastructure needs of New South Wales during the time of his premiership.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Australia is a significant country on the world stage. We are the 12th biggest donor to the United Nations. Since 1947 we have contributed more than 65,000 personnel to UN peace and security missions. This is the fifth time that Australia will be serving on the Security Council. The UN plays an important role in international security, giving mandates for major missions, whether it be Afghanistan or East Timor; in the work of its agencies, the World Food Organization and the World Health Organization; in conventions such as the Convention on the Rights of the Child; and in transnational crime. And the list goes on. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Australia needs and deserves to be at the top table when it comes to the United Nations. There is no disagreement from the coalition on that point. The fact that we have such hardworking and effective members in our diplomatic corps, who act in a non-partisan manner to execute the wishes and the policies of the government of the day, is why we have been successful in this campaign. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">To the former Secretary of the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade, Dennis Richardson; to our ambassador in New York, Gary Quinlan; to deputy secretary Gillian Bird; to the Prime Minister's Special Envoy, Joanna Hewitt; to the former ambassador in India and elsewhere, John McCarthy; to Special Envoy Bill Fisher; to head of the task force Caroline Millar; to people like Bassim Blazey; and to those on the coalition side, Tim Fischer, Robert Hill and Russell Trood, I say to you: thank you for the work that you have done to help make Australia's campaign for the UN Security Council successful.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">But the reason why the coalition has raised questions about this bid is not that we should not be at the top table on the UN Security Council. Of course we should be. And, when we get there in 2013-14, we have to do a good job and there are plenty of issues like North Korea and Afghanistan and the war on terrorism and Iran's quest for nuclear weapons. They are on the table and we will have a seat at the table. It is a good thing for Australia and it is a good thing for the world. But why we have raised questions in this place and outside this place is that the manner of the government's campaign compromised our values. And it came with a cost and it is dishonest of those on the other side to ignore that reality. It is one thing to celebrate the victory, but it is another to ignore the reality of the campaign itself. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Our Governor-General was sent on an unusual 18-day tour of Africa in order to win votes. That is not a normal role for the Governor-General. We have changed our vote on Israel in the UN Security Council, in order to placate some in the Arab world, to win votes in the campaign. We have increased our aid budget and directed it at certain parts of the world in order to win votes—$5 billion goes towards our aid budget and that is growing. We have seen increasing amounts of money, hundreds and hundreds of millions, sent to the Caribbean, Latin America and Africa. Yes, we have interests there; there is no question about that. But that money has gone to those places in the world in order to curry favour. I ask: what is the Australian interest and responsibility in paying $150,000 for a statue to go outside the United Nations to commemorate the antislavery movement in the Caribbean and Africa? That statue should be there, but it does not necessarily need Australian dollars.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Our foreign minister has also changed his travel itinerary in order to win votes. He went to Mongolia and Malta ahead of India and Papua New Guinea. Papua New Guinea is our nearest neighbour, and in Papua New Guinea we have a terrible situation where 12,000 children under the age of five die every year. If I had a say, I would be saying put some of that money towards eradicating the dangers that lead to the untimely deaths of those 12,000 children. Go and visit Papua New Guinea and India before you go to Mongolia and Malta.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The other issue I want raise is Australia's participation in a conference for the Non-Aligned Movement in Iran. Australia is not a member of the Non-Aligned Movement; however, Australia decided not to send its ambassador but rather to send the Prime Minister's special envoy and our ambassador to the UN in New York to Tehran. Tehran is a state sponsor of terrorism. Tehran is hell-bent on getting a nuclear weapon. Tehran, under Ahmadinejad and the ayatollahs, is a danger to the world. But Australia closed its eyes to that reality in order to ensure that we had a high-level delegation present in Teheran at the meeting of the Non-Aligned Movement to which Australia is not a member. I say shame on the government for doing that.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I finish where I started. Australia is an important nation in the world. We are the 12th biggest contributor to the UN budget. We should have a bigger footprint in countries around the world, but instead this government has starved DFAT, seeing more than 100 people cut in the last budget alone. There is no disagreement from the coalition that having a seat at the top table, at the United Nations, is a good thing. The UN does important work to better the lives of people, whether it is health and education, whether it is the cultural sphere or whether it is the security sphere. The world is a better place with the United Nations. Australia, as a significant country, should be at the top table.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">But I say to you with experience that the way this government has gone about the campaign has compromised our values. It has done so in a way that has come at a cost. If $24 million was the only expense, I would say that was money well spent. But $24 million is a fraction of what has been spent. As I said, hundreds of millions of dollars has been diverted from the aid budget. The United Nations is an important body. Australia's role in the United Nations at the top table is an important development. But please, as this government prepares our diplomats and our representatives to participate in the deliberations of the UN Security Council as a member of that body, do not compromise on our values. Stay true to our national interest and remember that in diplomacy it is values and interests that count.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">
                  <a href="HWR" type="MemberSpeech">
                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Ms PARKE</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Fremantle</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">19:34</span>):  It will come as no surprise to anyone that I am absolutely thrilled about Australia's election to a temporary seat on the United Nations Security Council and I thank everyone involved in achieving this wonderful result. In my capacity as the Chair of the UN Parliamentary Group, the UNICEF Parliamentary Association and Parliamentarians for Global Action's Australia branch, as well as being a member of the Joint Standing Committee on Foreign Affairs, Defence and Trade, the Joint Committee on Human Rights and the Joint Standing Committee on Treaties and having been a staff member of the UN for eight years, I have had the opportunity to see, both at close range and from the vantage point of this place, the workings of the UN and its importance in so many ways to the world. I have also witnessed the extent of the impact of Australia's interaction and involvement with the UN, how we value-add to that body and to the international community.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Of course, peacekeeping by the blue helmets is a key part of the work of the UN Security Council and is probably the aspect most well recognised by people throughout the world. Australia has a proud history of being involved with UN peacekeeping from the very first days of the UN, and Australians have served with distinction in both military and civilian roles. I am proud to have been one of those civilian peacekeepers during my time with the UN peacekeeping mission in Kosovo from 1999 to 2002.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Australia's peacekeeping and peace-building efforts can only be enhanced if the government responds positively to this week's report from the foreign affairs committee inquiry into Australia's overseas representation, in which the committee recommended that a mediation unit be established within AusAID to prevent conflict and thereby avoid the much greater costs—in human and economic terms—of humanitarian emergency aid and post-conflict reconstruction and development.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Australia's seat on the UN Security Council also ties in well with our forthcoming hosting of the G20 and membership of the G20 troika, where issues of food security and eliminating global poverty must be central to addressing the root causes of conflict and terrorism. Also important to that effort will be the UN arms trade treaty which aims to control the global trade in the small arms and light weapons that do so much damage to already fragile nations. It has been said that AK47s are the real weapons of mass destruction in the world today. Australia has played a key role in the negotiation of this treaty and will be able to use its influence on the UN Security Council to encourage members of the UN General Assembly to return to negotiations on the arms trade treaty. This is a matter that Parliamentarians for Global Action has taken up as one of its key campaigns including collecting more than 50 signatures from Australian federal MPs and senators in support of the arms trade treaty. Of course, most of the victims of the conflicts powered by small arms are women and children. Australia being on the UNSC will enable us to directly focus on UN Security Council resolution 1325 on women in armed conflict.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">A further area where Australia's leadership would be pivotal is in relation to nuclear nonproliferation and disarmament. Of course, Australia is already a co-chair, along with Japan, of the nuclear nonproliferation and disarmament initiative and the UN Security Council position will enable further promotion of the comprehensive test ban treaty and the fissile material cut-off treaty as well as the expansion of nuclear-weapons-free zones, but Australia can also take the opportunity presented by the UN Security Council position to move the international community towards abolition of nuclear weapons through a nuclear weapons convention.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">It is also important in my view that Australia use its position on the Security Council to be a firm and constant advocate of human rights. The preamble to the UN Charter states:</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Small">We the peoples of the United Nations determined</span>

              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Small">to save succeeding generations from the scourge of war, which twice in our lifetime has brought untold sorrow to mankind, and</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Small">to reaffirm faith in fundamental human rights, in the dignity and worth of the human person, in the equal rights of men and women and of nations large and small, and</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">

                <span class="HPS-Normal">The United Nations Association of Australia has recommended that a primary focus for Australia on the UN Security Council should be to strengthen the responsibility to protect doctrine. In a submission to government, the United Nations Association of Australia quotes Professor Ramesh Thakur as follows:</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Small">There is a striking depth of consensus in support of R2P principles among state representatives, UN officials and other policy and civil society actors …Yet there is also deep disquiet among many, verging on outright distrust in some key countries like Brazil, China, Germany, India, and Russia, about how far UN authorisation for the Libyan operation was stretched. As a result, over the next two-three years, a priority UN agenda will be to formulate an agreed set of criteria or guidelines to help the Security Council in the debate before an R2P military intervention is authorised, and a monitoring or review mechanism to ensure that the Council has an oversight role and exercises supervisory control over the operation during implementation. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The UN Association of Australia also quotes Andrew Hewett, the Executive Director of Oxfam Australia, in relation to the need to clarify the scope and application of protection of civilians. Hewett noted:</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Small">As played out in Libya we have also seen that what the Council means by ‘protection of civilians’ can have extremely wide interpretations. There has been a conflation of the protection of civilians obligations under customary and International Humanitarian Law and with the Responsibility to Protect—the latter being a political agreement among member states that has an unclear normative status. This led to considerable confusion in Libya about what actions were appropriate and allowable for NATO to take in fulfilling its mandate—and the political fallout from this experience is largely responsible for the Council’s slow response to crises along the Sudan/South Sudan border and in Syria.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The UN Association of Australia notes that, having advanced so far, there is a risk that unless the momentum is maintained these doctrines could become discredited. The UN Association argues, and I agree, that few countries are better placed than Australia to lead on these issues.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Finally, I would like to note as apposite the words of one of my predecessors as the federal member for Fremantle, the great Labor Prime Minister John Curtin. John Curtin made his last major parliamentary speech on 28 February 1945 in which he championed the new international peacekeeping organisation that would become the United Nations after the war. In that speech Curtin said:</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Small">If we are to concert with other peoples of goodwill in order to have a better world, there must be some pooling of sovereignty, some association of this country with other countries, and some agreement which, when made, should be kept. For this purpose, there must be some realization that countries cannot always have their own way, if they really wish to live in amity. There must be some give and take. That is the real test, and in wartime the test is not in the taking but in the giving. There is a price that the world must pay for peace; there is a price that it must pay for collective security. I shall not attempt to specify the price, but it does mean less nationalism, less selfishness, less race ambition. Does it not mean also, some consideration for others and a willingness to share with them a world which is, after all, good enough to give to each of us a place in it, if only all of us will observe reason and goodwill toward one another? </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Those are wonderful, timeless words spoken at a time of war. They highlight an aspect of John Curtin's leadership which is perhaps not widely appreciated in this country—a commitment to the international community and to the role that Australia can play as a leading global citizen. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Recently we celebrated United Nations Day on 24 October. As the UN Secretary-General said:</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Small">Never has the United Nations been so needed. In our increasingly interconnected world, we all have something to give and something to gain by working together. Let us unite, seven billion strong, in the name of the global common good.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I welcome Australia securing a seat on the UN Security Council. We have much to contribute.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">
                  <a href="00AMV" type="MemberSpeech">
                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Mr HUNT</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Flinders</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">19:43</span>):  I want to address very briefly the role and the priorities for Australia within the United Nations Security Council. Let me begin with the very simple proposition that the role of the Security Council is, as it is most classically formulated under chapters VI and VII of the United Nations charter, in the preservation and maintenance of international peace, border security and good governance. In particular chapter VII of the charter gives the council responsibility to act in cases of a threat to the peace, a breach of the peace or an act of aggression. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">It is my view that there should be three priorities for Australia during its time on the Security Council. Others will debate the whys and the wheres of the process over which there was a considerable series of questions for the government to answer, but looking forward there is an opportunity to express our commitment to practical international security in the following ways. Firstly, we need to focus on deep regional security issues.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">In particular, I believe that means—and this is a personal view—that we should be working constructively, with China, the United States, ASEAN, India and Australia as part of this, towards a sea lanes partnership to help guarantee freedom of the seas, whether it is in the Strait of Hormuz, the Strait of Malacca or the Taiwan Strait. That is a personal goal, not a party policy. It is a long-term goal, and I think the Security Council could be an opportunity for that. Secondly, in terms of peacekeeping, we should try to export the Timor model. East Timor was an absolute model of everything we should look for in a successful peacekeeping mission. I recently returned. I saw the training, the discipline and the success of the Australians. Finally—because I will also have to speak in the House—our third area should be in countering terrorism and war crimes. I believe there is a role for the right to protect and the development of the formal Security Council mandate. I believe that we will have to take steps to deal with the war crimes which are clearly occurring in Syria now. Part of our role should be to make sure that there is a clear remit for a case to the international war crimes tribunal against the full leadership of those in Syria who are responsible. It is a short list, but it is a priority list: classic security, peacekeeping and making sure that we are protecting the human rights of those most at risk.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">
                  <a href="KV5" type="MemberSpeech">
                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Mr NEVILLE</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Hinkler</span>—<span class="HPS-MinisterialTitles">The Nationals Deputy Whip</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">19:46</span>):  I rise to add my words in celebration of Australia being elected to the Security Council. What I would like to say tonight is that I am appalled that this debate in the chamber, from both sides, has degenerated into tit for tat on a level that is unworthy of us. This is not a time to try to embarrass one party or the other because of a stance they have taken at one time or another at the UN. As the parliamentary secretary, the member for Corio, quite adequately pointed out, a lot of our campaigns as Australians at the UN have crossed the political divide several times: one government has initiated a move and another one has had to carry it out. So, if we have cause to be joyful, it is because we played our part in that. If we have cause to be ashamed, we should be ashamed on both sides.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The UN is a strange invention; there is no question about that. But when Australia goes on the international stage, as it did for this seat on the Security Council, we should be looking to act as one. It was a great matter of international pride. The other reason we should be mindful of it is that 65,000 Australians—note that: 65,000 Australians—have served with the UN in either peacekeeping or security actions. They have been on UN-mandated missions, and some of them—both military and civilian—have given their lives for the UN and for Australia. To turn this debate into a tit-for-tat session is to dishonour their memory and to dishonour the role that those people played in making the world the better place that it is today.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Sure, it could be better. We all know that, and we all know the UN is wasteful and sometimes indulgent. We all know that it can be excessively bureaucratic in its procedures. We know its administration is also bureaucratic. We know that some nations do not pull their weight, either financially or by way of giving assistance to military and peacekeeping operations.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">But let me put this to you, colleagues: what would be there if there wasn't a UN? Who would deliver the aid? Who would go into the drought ravaged areas and provide the relief? Who would fight the disease? Who would provide the water and the agricultural programs? Who would eliminate malaria, polio and the like? As we have known on our own doorstep, we have tuberculosis problem in the Torres Strait. One has to ask whether AusAID should be not more focused on getting that under some sort of mandate. If the state and federal governments cannot agree on it then, for heaven sake, let us bring in some outside body.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">It was my privilege between September and December 2009 to go to the UN. Indeed, my colleague here at the table was at the UN the year before me in 2008. I took my role at the UN very seriously, as did my co-delegate, Annette Ellis, the former member for Canberra. We attended to our duties every day at the Australian Embassy and we went to the UN. We were each members of three committees of the UN. We debated issues on committees. We gave speeches. We represented the ambassador at functions. We participated in the argy-bargy that goes on at the UN—we were trying to put Australia's case. We took it seriously, as well we might. It was a great insight into what the UN can achieve. What I found very impressive while I was there was the quality of our young diplomats. The quality was just superb. When I hear this debate today get down to this tit-for-tat level, I think we diminish their work as well.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">If we go back over the formation of the UN—back to 1946—Australia was a foundation member. The first president of the UN was an Australian, Dr Evatt. We will have been on the Security Council—with this recent appointment—five times. People who want to say, 'Why are we worried about the Security Council?' There are 193 nations in the UN and only 15 of them actually get on to the Security Council. There are five permanent members and 10 others in two rotations. We are there as one of those. If you take the five permanent ones off 193 and you get 188. We are one nation in 18 that have a seat there. That was quite exceptional. When you think about it, we are in a very awkward position in being clustered with the Europeans, because the natural instinct in Europe would be vote for a European country. For Australia to score the largest number of votes—140 votes—when you need about two-thirds of the votes to get a seat, is quite exceptional. That did not come about by just buying our way there.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Let us go back to the World Cup—not that the World Cup of soccer is on the same level as the UN. But there we spent a lot of money and got done like a dinner. This was much more than that. Yes, it is estimated that somewhere between $25 million and $45 million was spent one way and another in securing a seat. But to characterise that as bribes is silly. Much of it was additional aid money—discretionary aid money, if you like—that went to good purpose.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">When you come back to those 193 countries, we in this place aspire to get to cabinet or at least be a parliamentary secretary or cabinet minister. When you get there you are one of a select few. The Security Council is, in one way, like the cabinet of the UN. So if you get there or your country gets there, it is where the business is done. That is where you do start to exercise some real influence.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">For those who denigrate the UN and criticise its indulgence and wastefulness, its bureaucracy and criticise that some nations do not pull their weight financially and so on, let me ask you: what would happen if there was not the UN? Let me ask you: what might have happened in the Korean War if there had not been a UN, because that was its first action? What about the mandatory arms embargo against South Africa, peacekeeping in Cyprus when that country became totally ungovernable, the authorising of forces to oust Iraqi forces from Kuwait where Australians served? Remember all that? Remember setting up war crimes tribunals at The Hague, authorising the East Timor peacekeeping force, INTERFET? You could go on about all sorts of things such as sanctions against North Korea on two occasions because of nuclear testing. There are whole range of these things that have gone on to say nothing of the countless peacekeeping and military actions that we, as Australia, have taken on—South West Africa, the Horn of Africa, in the Pacific, the Solomon Islands, in our own region, and so on. These have all been critical to Australia. As I said before, 65,000 personnel had served over that time since 1946 when Dr Evatt took up the first presidency of the UN.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We might also be interested to know that Australia is the 12th largest contributor to regular and peacekeeping funds, and we are in the top 10 for the World Health Organization, the world food fund, the UN Children's Fund and the High Commissioner for Refugees. So in other words, we are seen as being a capable and dependable international citizen. That, again, annoys me that we let this debate slip into a tit for tat exercise.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I remember one night I went to a cocktail party opened by Ban Ki-moon in the foyer of the UN building, and it was about the women of West Africa. It was very confronting with photos and paintings. I remember one particular photo that has stayed in my mind ever since. It was of a woman with a little baby in her arms, but her hand had been hacked off and it was bandage. Here was a poor woman in desperate poverty, who had probably lost her hand to some rebel group, and she was trying to suckle this little kid. It just touched my inner being. Ask yourself if you are a critic of the UN: what organisation would you put in place to look after those people? Who is going to speak for them? Who is going to go to West Africa and speak for people like that?</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We played a very significant role in the funding and the organisation of the UN, and we have been there since day one. We were a foundation member. We held the first presidency. Winning a seat on the UN has been going on for the best part of four years, if not longer. It is a great tribute to Gary Quinlan, the Australian Ambassador to the UN, that he pulled this off. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">It was when I was at the UN that we were starting to crank up the campaign. All the young diplomats played a part in that. I used to see them at work. I remember one day they were enormously proud. In all the years of the UN, on this particular issue—even though it was not a big issue—the five permanent members of the Security Council had never voted together. Australia was sponsoring this resolution and these young diplomats went out and, for the first time, got the five permanent members to vote for it. I remember one of the ambassadors came back and abused them. I was sitting next to the Australian Ambassador to Geneva, and I said, 'What's all that about?' 'Ah,' she said, 'a loss of face'.</span>

                  </a>  I was congratulating the Australian Ambassador to the UN, Gary Quinlan, and his staff for their outstanding work. As I said earlier in my presentation, I think the standard of our junior diplomats at the UN is quite exceptional. They, I am sure, played extraordinary part in getting this vote of 140. I also congratulate former ambassadors like Robert Hill and ambassadors in other countries, such as the New Zealand High Commissioner, who stitched up countries to vote for us. It was really a teamwork effort right across the world, and I can understand why Australia should take great pride in it.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I would like to return to my theme that I thought it was unfortunate tonight that we let this debate degenerate into a bit of a slanging match rather than celebrating what is a marvellous victory—a victory that puts Australia at the centre of decision making for the UN and where we can exercise our influence, and, hopefully, see some reforms in the UN. We have had a long drought, waiting 27 years for this position. I think we have got to ask ourselves: after two years is up, what strategy have we got for staying in the Security Council from time to time? To finish my presentation tonight, what I would like to say is: I think we could be much more strategic. It is known that as part of the reforms of the UN, the European Community wants a seat at the UN in its own right. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Some people might think it is unwise to take it away from individual countries and have a corporate group, but I suppose that Europeans now have become semi-national is not national in their outlook. But I would support that if the countries that have been clustered with the Europeans, including Canada, Australia, New Zealand, Fiji, Papua New Guinea and the like, were given our own place—call it, if you like, the Pacific basin position—on the Security Council. That would mean that Australia would get two years in every eight or perhaps every 10.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Rather than saying what was wrong with the Labor Party or the coalition in their attitudes to the current win on the Security Council, why don't we work together to get a new strategy to make sure that we do not have another 27-year drought in two years time? Why don't we do some really strategic planning on what would suit Australia's interests? Why should Australia be clustered with Europeans to find our place in the world? We are in the Pacific. We are the lead nation in the Pacific. Canada is not clustered with the US or with Latin America. These countries work together in the UN. They call themselves CANZ—Canada, Australia and New Zealand. It would make a very fine combination. It would provide a leadership roles for many of those smaller Pacific nations, and it would mean that Australia, more frequently than ever before, had a place at the table where the decisions are made.</span>

                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">
                    <a href="00AN0" type="MemberSpeech">
                      <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Mr CIOBO</span>
                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Moncrieff</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">20:47</span>):  I am pleased to rise to speak to the third report of the Parliamentary Joint Select Committee on Gambling Reform, <span style="font-style:italic;">The prevention and treatment of problem gambling</span>. I will say at the outset that coalition members of the committee, like all members of this parliamentary joint committee, have very real and serious concerns about the incidence of problem gambling in Australia. It is not only the incidence of problem gambling that concerns us; it is also the severity of problem gambling.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The focus of this particular inquiry was to look at the extent to which the issue of problem gambling exists as well as measures that could be undertaken to reduce the incidence and severity of problem gambling. In many respects, the committee's inquiry on this particular issue dovetailed quite nicely with a lot of the evidence the committee previously took on mandatory precommitment of electronic gaming machines.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">What is clear is that problem gambling is a very real problem in our community. We know that it affects thousands of people. We know that it indirectly affects tens of thousands more. It is important to recognise—and this is certainly the view that to some extent I had at the outset but which was further reinforced based on testimony and submissions that were made to the committee—that unfortunately problem gambling is not unlike aberrant behaviour that we see in a number of other fields. We have, for example, an alcohol industry which also sees incidences of problem drinking. As well as that, I think it is worth recognising those who have a problem with their calorie intake. I might even be among them—although not too severely, I hope. That notwithstanding, there are people who have a problem with the amount they eat. There are those who have issues when it comes to controlling their spending. There are people who reach a stage where they simply spend too much money. That also has a highly detrimental and negative impact on others. Indeed, there are also those who exercise too much and have a problem because of the endorphins and dopamine released—problem exercising, for want of a better term.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I do not raise these points to be flippant. There are some who would make the attempt to characterise highlighting problem behaviours across a variety of fields as in some way belittling problem gambling, but I make it very clear that I am not tempting to do that. What I am striving to do is to illustrate that there is, thankfully, a small percentage of the community who find that a particular activity or activities trigger in them urges and impulses which they have great difficulty controlling. Gambling is certainly one of them, eating is another and drinking is another—there is a multitude of such activities. The key issue, though, is how as a parliament and as policymakers we react to concerns about such activities. Coalition members were broadly supportive of the tone and findings of the report, but there were elements of it that we could not agree with and that I certainly could not agree with because they overstated and overly simplified the concerns about the report and the responses contained in the report.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">It is important to recognise—and I add this to the <span style="font-style:italic;">Hansard</span> record—the very strong and effective work that industry has undertaken on problem gambling. I know from the good relationship I have with—for example—Echo Entertainment and Jupiters Casino on the Gold Coast that they have on their permanent staff full-time people who are in charge of dealing with problem gambling incidents and with those whose lives gambling has overtaken. They have these people on their staff because casinos, like clubs, pubs and clubs and others that operate wagering facilities, have no desire to have a great subset of the Australian population dealing with problem gambling. I sincerely believe that the industry in toto wants to do what it can to reduce the incidence of problem gambling. I applaud efforts made by casino operators, by Clubs Australia, by the AHA and by others to directly tackle problem gambling. We know that their efforts have had an impact because the incidence of problem gambling has declined over time. That is a good sign. It is encouraging. Of course more needs to be done, but it would be incorrect to assert that industry has not played its part, and I applaud and congratulate the industry on it.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">There is no shadow of a doubt that there is a lack of important data collection on problem gambling and the synthesising of that of data, and the report touches upon this at significant length. I am fully supportive—and I think I can say on behalf of the coalition members of the committee that they too are supportive—of attempts to collate the increasing amounts of data on problem gambling and to use it effectively. There can be no doubt that to do so is to empower people, both those in the industry and others, who want to make a difference in our community and help reduce the incidence of problem gambling.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I am afraid that it is my view that we will never be free of the scourge of problem gambling. But what we need to do is to work out how we can address it more effectively than we currently are. Certainly we are effective to some extent now in addressing it, but there is scope to be more effective. Industry is undertaking initiatives, and government is undertaking initiatives. Having problem gambling as a public health priority is a step in the right direction. But it is important that industry does not become a pariah. It is important that those who dislike gambling because they have seen some of the very real negative impacts of problem gambling take a deep breath and recognise that they need to work with industry to achieve mutually beneficial outcomes which are both sustainable in the long term and can be effectively implemented by industry itself. In many respects it is the staff of gaming houses and pubs and clubs with poker machines who are at the front line when intervening with problem gamblers. That is why I stress to those who would like to turn the industry into some kind of pariah that they need to recognise the importance and value of working collaboratively with industry to ensure that industry does its very best to weed out and identify those who have gambling problems and to help them and provide them with the direct forms of assistance and intervention that they require.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">It was good to be part of this committee. I am pleased to recognise the bona fides of all members on the committee and their desire to make a meaningful difference in this area of policy. I want to acknowledge, as I said, the great work the industry has undertaken. It is also worth stressing that this is an industry that employs hundreds of thousands of people. This is an industry that provides vital infrastructure across communities. This is an industry that helps to drive support for small sports and Aussie kids being involved in sports. This is an industry that helps put lifesavers on our beaches. This is an industry that helps to drive apprenticeships and TradeStarts and all manner of different occupations, both vocational and professional. This is an industry that provides significant dividends to our community. Sometimes that is lost in the debate, and coalition members made some attempts to balance the ledger in that respect. We are certainly pleased to be part of this report. As I said, there are elements that are overstated in their zeal for an anti-industry, anti-problem gambling approach that is not sustainable long term, but we have made our position clear in our supplementary comments to the report. I commend the report to the parliament.</span>

                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">

                      <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Mr DANBY</span>
                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Melbourne Ports</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">20:56</span>):  On Friday, Australian time, the UN decided Australia would be awarded a temporary seat on the Security Council. This win for Australia occurred, in my view, despite our thin diplomatic presence overseas. The government's decision to seek the seat and the process by which it sought it have been criticised by some. Sceptics have been critical of our timely increase of aid to Africa. Some even complained of us, as they described it, 'wandering around New York with Africans'.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Critically, it is Australia's inventory of underrepresented overseas missions that should be really the focus of our attention, as noted by the superb work of the chairman of this committee, Nick Champion, and his subcommittee. Australia's chronically low level of overseas representation is primarily responsible for the low level of public awareness that this country has overseas. For instance, in Nairobi our excellent ambassador Geoff Tooth has to represent us not only in Kenya but also Burundi, Rwanda, South Sudan, Somalia, Eritrea and Tanzania. He is Australia's ambassador to 132 million people. No public servant, however dedicated, can do that effectively.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The Joint Standing Committee on Foreign Affairs, Defence and Trade has also shown that we have been underrepresented in the Maghreb and in Latin America. Our embassy in Moscow is responsible for representation in Armenia, Belarus, Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan, Moldova, Tajikistan, Turkmenistan and Uzbekistan. Not only are we not represented in the 'stans', as the countries which were once called Soviet Central Asia are now known,but we are no longer represented in Kazakhstan. We briefly had an embassy in Astana in Kazakhstan, but it ceased operating after three years. Ukraine, which is a country of only 55 million people, full of mining engineers—I can hear the mining oligarchs salivating—is bereft of an Australian embassy. The country that has 55 million people has an embassy here, but we have no representative there. They have set aside land for an Australian embassy in Kiev. And you cannot represent Ukraine, Georgia, Azerbaijan and Moldova, who are all slightly antagonistic to Moscow, from Moscow. The poor people in Ukraine have to apply for a visa to Moscow before they have the honour of applying for a visa to Australia—a ridiculous situation given the particular capability of so many of its people in engineering, and particularly in mining, which is of great interest to this country.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Earlier this year, as Chair of the Joint Standing Committee on Foreign Affairs, Defence and Trade, I asked the then secretary of the department of foreign affairs, Mr Dennis Richardson, what he would be able to achieve in terms of priorities if we allocated each of three additional increases per year—$25 million, $50 million and $75 million. He responded that with the lowest figure he could seek representation or restart our embassy in Astana, Kazakhstan; Ulaanbaatar in Mongolia, which we in fact may do anyhow; Dakar in Senegal; Phuket in Thailand; and Funafuti in Tuvalu.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Let me address the issue of Africa. The most interesting conference in Australia, in my view, is a conference that takes place in Perth once a year called Africa Down Under. Africa Down Under now has 3,000 people attend it, including many, many delegates from across Africa. That is because Australia is a major player in Africa. Africa is not just a group of people wandering around Manhattan, as someone implied when they were denigrating our bid for a seat on the United Nations Security Council, but it is the only continent that has grown through the global financial crisis. It is a continent where our expertise in mining could certainly be put to great use. People all over the continent are seeking our advice as to how to behave in an open, transparent way in conducting themselves in business relationships, particularly in this new area.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">In relation to the second round of funding, Mr Richardson identified that for $50 million he could add Algeria; Luanda, Angola; Chongqing, inland China; Bogota, Colombia; and Dar es Salaam in Tanzania—Tanzania again, where Poor old Geoff Tooth is off representing us. That is a country of 35 million people, a very serious country. They are not just wandering around Manhattan. It too is a country with which Australia should have good relations.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The third suggestion was that for $75 million we could add representation in Rabat, Morocco; Oslo, Norway; and Bern in Switzerland. I do not particularly agree with Oslo or Bern. I think Kiev would be a far more important place for Australian representation from the national interest point of view. But the point is that Australia is poorly represented overseas. We won the bid at the United Nations despite our level of representation.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Taking it to the maximum that we offered in this excellent report of Mr Champion's, $75 million would only take us to a level of representation which is commensurate with our standing in the OECD. We would not be beating our chests; we would simply be represented at the same level as all other countries with comparable economies in the OECD. We are so far out the back of the G20. We rank as the 12th economy in the world but we have the lowest level of overseas representation in the G20. We are the last and out the back by a long shot. This is very short-sighted.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">As I said in the newspapers in supporting this report, it is not a matter of thumping our chests; this is a matter of representing Australia in consular terms, in aid terms. We have a very big aid program. In naked self-interest, in trade and business, particularly in Africa, and because Australia is considered an important country that contributes to international good order and peace, a country that is taken very seriously all over the world, as a strong, rich and successful country, it is time for us to step up, implement the findings of this report, take Mr Richardson's suggestions very seriously and extend the good work we have done by being elected to the United Nations by being represented overseas commensurate with our interests. I commend this report to the House.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">
                  <a href="219646" type="MemberSpeech">
                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Mr McCORMACK</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Riverina</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">21:04</span>):  Hurtling through the rough terrain of the Gobi Desert as a back seat passenger in a mining company's four-wheel drive vehicle, you do not get much opportunity to snap <span style="font-style:italic;">National Geographic</span> style photographs. Such was the case early last month whilst in Mongolia as part of a five-person delegation from the House of Representatives Standing Committee on Regional Australia visiting that fascinating country.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">That followed a trip to Canada, as part of the same inquiry process. I accompanied the member for New England, who headed the delegation, as well as the members for Capricornia and Durack and inquiry secretary Siobhan Leyne. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">This trip was part of the committee's inquiry into the fly in, fly out, drive in, drive out work practices in regional Australia. Both countries visited are experiencing mining booms and facing the challenges of resourcing massive and sudden upswings in activity with infrastructure and labour while trying to maintain the cultural integrity of their regions. What they told us of their experience has the potential to provide some of the answers to many of the questions raised during our site visits and public hearings in northern New South Wales, Queensland, the Northern Territory, South Australia, Victoria, outback Western Australia and here in Canberra.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">While in Mongolia we visited Oyu Tolgoi, also known as Turquoise Hill, just prior to it going fully operational. While we were down south in the Gobi we also drove for many hours through fascinating terrain inhabited only by traditional herdsmen with wild horses, camels and goats—about the only living creatures, from what the eye could tell. It is a remarkable place—though I am sure there are many more animals in that terrain; they were the ones we could see and they were very sparse. The landscape is the same, kilometre after kilometre. It is one of the remotest parts of the world yet, amazingly, full mobile telephone service is available—far better than what we have in many areas close to major regional cities in Australia and perhaps even in your electorate of Maranoa, Mr Deputy Speaker. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The copper deposits at OT, as it is called, were first explored in 1996, and the place really started to be developed in 2001. The mine, which is 600 kilometres south of the Mongolian capital Ulaanbaatar, will have an estimated life of 100 years. It is the world's largest underdeveloped copper and gold deposit, anticipated to produce 450,000 tonnes of copper and 330,000 ounces of gold per annum. That is what we were told—and they are amazing deposits. Rio Tinto will have spent more than US$5.2 million in the OT project by the end of the second quarter of 2012. Obviously there is a large international FIFO workforce required at OT. We were with the executives of Rio Tinto for lunch but I decided I would go and talk to the workers—I thought it would be good to hear things from people on the ground. Everyone knows what is going on, but these people were hopefully going to tell it to me straight. I found a spare spot at a table and there were two Americans there, and another fellow. I introduced myself and he said, 'I know who you are; I am Kirby Chaney'. He had not long before been working at Tumut, in my electorate of Riverina. You go thousands of kilometres away from your home base and you find somebody you are familiar to and even someone from your own electorate—in one of the remotest corners of the globe. It truly is a small world. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">OT will be the engine of the Mongolian economy. With a population of 2.6 million and a commitment to a 90 per cent Mongolian work force and FIFO turnover rates in other places approaching 40 per cent, a mining town will likely be an important feature in attracting employees. There are challenges for mining developments in Mongolia, as we heard—it will take some years to get a mining think instead of a herding think; to get people away from the sums, away from the traditional herding lifestyle, and get them thinking that this is the way of the future, that this is the way they can help their families to prosperity. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Dr Kern Von Hagen, who we spoke to, said the development of Mongolia would come as a result of leadership; good companies have the long-term view. It is what he called the managed approach, taking a long-term view. Mongolia's Minister of Education, Culture and Science, Luvsannyam Gantumur said:</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Small">As far as the mining sector is concerned, education is one of the most important issues.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The minister supports the building of the capacity of teachers and teacher training. This is one of the key areas where Australia is helping with many Mongolians who have gained tertiary education in Australia and are proud to call themselves 'Mozzies.' Importantly, English has just been adopted as the official second language of the country.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Mongolia will be a real competitor of Australia for resources in the years to come. Our delegation saw a number of coalmining operations, including one which had a remarkable 25-metre seam of coal—the blackest coal you could ever hope to see—just metres below the surface. It is said that, in some places, a metre seam of coal is paydirt. The deposits in Mongolia are quite extraordinary. Once the country gets its infrastructure right, it will be a serious player on the world stage.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Surprisingly, the road network in and around these mining sites is far better than that in Ulaanbaatar where they have just developed a numberplate system of odds and evens to avoid gridlock. Let me tell you that the traffic in the Mongolian capital is absolutely horrendous. Drivers seem to go the quickest way to a particular destination. Whether that requires driving on the wrong side of the road, it does not matter. The new government are doing their best to avoid the gridlock. They have a purpose and a vision. I wish them well in their endeavours to get a better transport system in Ulaanbaatar. They are certainly looking to the future with the mining developments. They have some good plans in place, which is encouraging for their country. Much of Mongolia's mineral wealth is being exported to China. However, that country, as we know, is going through a slowdown at the moment caused by global economic uncertainty and the fact that it has stockpiled resources such that it does not need to continue to build regional centres for the sake of building them.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Like Mongolia, Canada has a strict policy of employing its own people first and foremost. As well, Canadian mining companies are required to do secondary processing in that particular country. To start the trip we visited St John's, Newfoundland and Labrador. At a roundtable with the Department of Natural Resources at St John's we met the deputy minister, Diana Dalton, who described their local mining operations as 'world-class quality.' 'It is our Western Australia,' she said. The assistant deputy minister, Paul Carter, said that there was $50 billion worth of development planned, up to 2020, at Western Labrador. That of course is all underpinned by commodity pricing, as well as obviously having the necessary labour force but, as I said before, a necessary labour force that is essentially Canadian. Employees have to be Newfoundlanders. The mining companies have strict monitoring and reporting processes and their right to mine can be jeopardised by noncompliance. We were told that the rapid growth and outsiders coming in, even though from the same province, had resulted in long-term residents seeing their communities changing drastically. Homeowners are stacking up rents. Rental accommodation in a bungalow, which was $600 to $700 per month a few years ago, now brings $6,000 a month. We were told, 'It's crazy.' This is mirroring what is happening in areas of Australia, particularly in places our committee visited, Moranbah in Queensland, and Karratha and Kambalda in the west. Day Care Labrador West has<span style="font-weight:bold;"></span>had to close because they could not get sufficient staff. We were told that families are being evicted, as a by-product of high rental costs. And haven't we heard that, Member for Capricornia, in our travels throughout Australia? Mechanics are being flown in to work there. Managing growth is quite challenging. In Fermont, the population doubled to 5,600 in virtually no time at all. Fermont means 'iron mountain'. As Mr Carter said, this has concerns for the future if the iron ore industry goes soft. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The Mayor of Labrador City, Karen Oldford, who is a nurse practitioner, told a similar story about the challenges of FIFO and low-paid workers battling to stay in long-term towns. She said, 'We are lobbying very hard not to have a FIFO workforce and want provincial governments to take a stance on that. It decimates existing communities.' Those were her words. A bungalow worth $80,000 five years ago is now worth $400,000. A person on the sidewalk carried a prophetic message: 'I have a job; I have no place to live.' </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">In this part of Canada they have similar problems to Australia inasmuch as the population statistical data is not accurate. I implore our committee, when finalising its recommendations for this inquiry—it will be early next year, perhaps in February—to ensure that something other than census data better reflects the situation in developing mining communities in remote parts of Australia.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">One of the most enlightening places we visited was Bay Bulls, where the mayor, Harold Mullowney, told us of the enormous strides his community had made since having to diversify after cod fishing was banned. A total of 19,000 people lost their jobs on 2 July 1992, when the codfish moratorium was enacted. The local wharf has been diversified to begin operations in crab licences and is even producing gunboats to combat the drug trade in South America. Harold is a retired science teacher and he is proud of the fact that his community is pushing hard for local school leavers to go into trades which will be of benefit to this mightily resourceful place—with a mightily resourceful people, might I add. They are also a service wharf for Greenland.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">One thing the committee picked up on which is different from Australia is the power of local councils in Canada. Local government plays a far greater role in decision making about mining operations than is possible in Australia. There is a view that mining companies should do more for social housing for lower income rentals and there is a fear that the mining companies are only looking after FIFO workers. Local councils are objecting very strongly to that, from what were told.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We saw oil sands mining at Fort McMurray in Alberta. Fort McMurray has a population of 100,000 and about 55,000 camp beds, and that is projected to increase soon to 70,000 beds. The policy for work camps will be a maximum of 30 minutes' drive from work sites. The established community has done some work to deal with the issues of growth, crime, social needs, roads, infrastructure et cetera. There is a saying that if you want to see someone from Newfoundland or Nova Scotia you have only to go to Fort McMurray, because they are from all over Canada. The company Suncor flies so many people into its oil sands operations at Fort McMurray that, if it were operating as an airline, it would be the fourth largest in Canada, which is truly remarkable.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">It was a tremendous trip. There was good camaraderie between the members, and I think we learnt a lot from our travels. We learnt a lot from the people we met. Particular reference should be made to the wonderful people at the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade. We had Tom Fuller in Canada. Nothing was too much trouble for them. They set up the appointments with key players in government and in business and certainly with the mining companies. It was a real insight for our inquiry to help us get some good outcomes for FIFO and DIDO operations in Australia.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">A number of Australian companies are operating in these places. Leighton Holdings, Rio Tinto and BHP Billiton are making significant investments in regional areas in Mongolia. Leighton has investments in coal in Tavan Tolgoi and Rio Tinto has investments in copper and gold in OT which, as I say, is in the remote Gobi Desert. It is a long way from anywhere but they are certainly making great strides to ensure that the things they put in place are good not just for the mining companies. I have to say that you get the impression that they are also doing it for the benefit of the communities. Their mining operations will be around for decades and decades and they do not want to put things in place which will not be beneficial in the long term to the people or to their companies, because they are making big investments.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Australia and Mongolia are facing a similar challenge with the social impact of FIFO work practices—the impact on infrastructure, water, housing costs, food supply, school needs and the social fabric of regional areas. This has been a fascinating inquiry. Certainly it is a big issue in regional areas in Australia. I would like to think that we will get the census data right. I would like to think that from our recommendations, which will come early next year, we will put in place some things which will benefit the regional areas that rely on mining but also do not want their communities and their social fabric destroyed by big mining companies and FIFO workers coming in and not contributing to the towns in those regional centres.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">
                  <a href="83A" type="MemberSpeech">
                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Ms LIVERMORE</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Capricornia</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">21:19</span>):  I am really pleased to join with my colleagues who travelled with me on this delegation to Canada and Mongolia in the last couple of months. I think you can get a sense from the contribution by the member for Riverina that this trip made a very big impression on members of the committee. I am sure that you, Mr Deputy Speaker, as a representative for a region that is experiencing some of these issues, will be listening with great interest to us talk about what we saw overseas and how we hope that will inform the deliberations the committee will be undertaking very shortly for our report for the parliament and our recommendations to government.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The committee received this opportunity as a result of the parliament's annual program of choosing a committee to undertake a trip to two Asia-Pacific countries. In choosing Canada and Mongolia to be the subject of our application to the parliament, we were hoping and expecting that there would be lessons to be learned from the shared experience in those countries of dealing with very fast growth in mining activity and the interactions that were happening between local communities, local populations, and those mining developments. I think we were all hopeful that this would be a very valuable delegation, but we were probably all surprised at just how much we felt we learned. You are never quite sure when you go to another country how much relevance there will be. You will see interesting things, but whether they will actually be relevant and contribute to solutions here in Australia is another question. I think we have come back with a strong sense that there are things that we will take from what we saw on our trip that we will bring into our committee report.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Before I forget—I do not want to leave it till the end because I would hate to overlook anyone—I say a big thank you particularly to Siobhan Leyne, who is the committee secretary, who did a terrific job in distilling our thoughts and our arguments for why our committee should be chosen to undertake this trip. Siobhan did a great job on that submission, putting that case forward, and also, of course, a great job in organising the program and liaising with the DFAT officials and others overseas. Of course, the International and Community Relations Office were a part of that as well. I also want to say thank you to the DFAT staff in overseas posts who were such a big help to us. The member for Riverina referred to Tom Fuller, who looked after us in Canada. Tom and his wife are expecting their first child any day now, on 3 November as I recall, so we certainly send our best wishes to Tom and his wife and await the joyful news that their child has been born safely. Very importantly, I say thank you to Tom for his great work in looking after us in Canada. A similar role was carried out in Mongolia by Natalie Barnes from the embassy in Seoul, and Dean Woodgate was there also. Dean has a role in promoting Australian Education International at the embassy in Seoul.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">As the member for Riverina has described, we started our trip in Canada. We flew all the way to St John's, Newfoundland, in one hit, which was quite an experience. That is where we really started. The delegation got off to such a great start, because our very first meeting—the member for Riverina will correct me if I am wrong—was with representatives from the provincial government in Newfoundland and Labrador and also representatives from the local government in Labrador City in the western part of the province, where very big iron ore operations have been operating for quite some time.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We got a really strong sense from that meeting of some of the similarities in what the community is experiencing with expansions going on in the iron ore industry, but also there was quite a different attitude—or at least more power available to the local government to take charge of and drive some of the decision making around their local community.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">So I got the sense that local government there were possibly more empowered than our equivalent local governments in Australia and certainly were not afraid to use the powers that they did have. I am talking about things like planning and licensing powers, both for the mines and very particularly as to the question of temporary accommodation to facilitate mining development at the construction phase. So they really did use whatever powers they had to feel like they were in the driver's seat for their community.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I got the very strong sense that the provincial and local governments were very much on the same page and working together in strong partnership towards similar goals of community empowerment and engagement with the development that was going on around them. They talked about the benefit agreement that effectively companies have to sign up to and about the terms and conditions, which companies agree to, that make sure that benefits like local jobs and local content and royalties come back to the province. They had a very strong view of what they wanted to get out of the development, so it was not just a one-way thing where it was what the company could get out of the resource activity. So there was a very strong view about what the province and local community expected to get out of it as well.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We went from there to speak to one of the companies involved, Iron Ore Canada, which is a Rio Tinto subsidiary. We were very impressed by their attitude and they really described to us their taking the initiative. They are not the only company operating in that region, so they talked to us about how they as a company felt an obligation and took the initiative to bring the other companies operating in that region to the table, together with provincial officials and local government, to talk about what was going to be happening and how some of these things could be managed while building that shared picture of what the community could expect and aspire to and how they could partner with the community to get the benefits and ameliorate some of the problems that might arise. So there seemed to be a real environment that fostered those expectations of companies and the companies seemed to show a willingness to meet those obligations and be genuine partners in the region.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We went from there to Alberta and saw Fort McMurray, which to me, as the member who represents Moranbah in my electorate, felt like Moranbah on steroids. As the member for Riverina mentioned, it has something like a population of 100,000 but at least half of those are fly in, fly out workers living in camps around the place. The population has doubled in the last 10 years. So Fort McMurray gave us a real snapshot of some of the opportunities but also some of the problems that local communities over there are trying to deal with. I was very impressed in Alberta by the initiative, one that was described to us at a meeting in Edmonton of provincial government officials, of the Alberta Oil Sands Secretariat. That has a coordinating role within the government so that the government can take a whole of government look at development that is happening in the oil sands region and communities. That was sitting within Treasury and the idea was that it be rather than the very piecemeal approach that we have particularly in Queensland.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The Queensland experience is that everything is quite reactive and you have got one government department just dealing with applications for mining licences and mining activities in a fairly piecemeal approach. The Alberta Oil Sands Secretariat is about this: when an application comes in the provincial government develops a mechanism by which you can then, across the government, look at all the implications of that so you are dealing not just with the application but with what arises out of that application and how the provincial government, with local government involvement, can respond to some of the issues. It is similar to a recommendation that the committee has heard from Mount Isa council. It was put to us by the Mayor of Mount Isa, who is a former state minister for resources in Queensland and so knows a bit about some of these structural matters. So that is something for the committee to think about.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We then went through to a very different country—but one that gave us just as much to think about and had just as much to teach us. Part of the trip in Mongolia had a different, more official, focus. As representatives of our parliament, the committee sought to reaffirm Australia's friendship with Mongolia, particularly given that this year is the 40th anniversary of the establishment of diplomatic relations between our two countries. We wanted to reaffirm that friendship and to look for ways that our country can continue to support Mongolia on its journey of development and in making the most of its resources.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We learned that we share a lot—environmentally and in the area of resource opportunities. These are obvious areas where we can assist their development and their aspirations to become a strong resource exporting country. A very important part of that, as the member for Riverina mentioned, is the role of AusAID in providing scholarships. These have increased in the last year from 28 per year to 38. The scholarships provide opportunities for Mongolians to come to Australia and study at our leading universities in the areas of law and governance. I think the program has been expanded so there can be more of an emphasis on, say, engineering, environmental management and things like that. The scholarships are about trying to build capacity—helping Mongolia to make the most of its resources and take control of its future.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We were really impressed with what we saw at Rio Tinto's operation at Oyuu Tolgoi. We came away with a very strong sense, as the member for Riverina said, that these guys are fair dinkum. They really want this to work. Sure, they want to mine copper and they want to make a profit, but they also believe very strongly—and you can see the evidence with your own eyes—in creating something which belongs to Mongolia and which Mongolians will benefit from. Those benefits will come not only through the royalties and taxes the company will pay but also through the very significant investments in training, education and community building. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Here in Australia, the committee has been getting the message that you have to have FIFO for mining to be viable. But then we saw what Rio Tinto is doing over in Mongolia. About 90 per cent of the workforce at this copper mine, the world's biggest copper mine, is already Mongolian. Rio Tinto surveyed their workforce. Their workforce said, 'We really want to live here with our families.' So Rio is looking very seriously at how to establish a long-term sustainable functioning community alongside that mine—a demonstration, as I said, of how these guys are not in there just to make a quick buck. They really are genuinely committed to the country and are working with the Mongolian government, the Mongolian people and, importantly, their workforce to make sure those benefits are spread far and wide throughout the country.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">In closing, it was, as always, great to catch up with the Mozzies. The Mozzies are an alumni group—people who have studied in Australia. They are very passionate supporters of Australia and great friends to all Australian visitors to Mongolia. I thank them again for their hospitality. I am really looking forward to getting our teeth into this report, which I think will benefit greatly from our travels as a committee, not just in Australia—obviously we have travelled extensively throughout Australia—but also internationally. It has been very helpful to get this international perspective and some of the solutions and ideas it provides.</span>
